**Primary Keyword**  
{main_kw}

Use this keyword naturally throughout the article.  
It **must appear**:
- in the title (H1),
- within the first 100 words of the introduction,
- and in at least one of the later H2 headings (not the first one).

Avoid overuse — the keyword should feel integral to the topic, not stuffed.  
If the topic seems unrelated, briefly explain a practical connection; avoid forced metaphors.  
When placing the keyword in an H2, blend it into a natural phrase — do **not** use the bare keyword as a standalone heading.  
If **{main_kw}** is empty, ignore all keyword-placement rules and write a natural, coherent article.

Your task:
1. Generate a **short, SEO-friendly title** (max 60 characters).  
   - Place it as the first line, formatted in Markdown:  
     # Your Title Here  
   - The title must sound natural, keyword-rich, and clearly related to the topic.  
   - Include the primary keyword (or a close variant); if missing, **rewrite** the title to include it.  
   - The H1 **must not end with punctuation**.

1a. Write one short meta description (≤160 characters) for this page.  
    Start the line with: META_DESCRIPTION:

2. Write a **comprehensive English-language blog post** following the rules below.

**Article Requirements**

- **Word count:** 2200–2500 words. Expand sections with examples and practical advice until reaching this range.  
- **Tone:** Clear, practical, and trustworthy — expert yet approachable, focusing on real results, craftsmanship, and precision.  
- **Structure:**  
  - Begin with a relatable lifestyle scene or emotional moment (350–500 words).  
  - Follow with a one-sentence **Quick Summary** inside blockquotes.  
  - Use **4–6 H2 sections**, ensuring H2s are creative yet relevant (**each H2 under 60 characters**); add H3 where useful.  
  - Each section 250–350 words.  
- **Tips:** Provide **3–5 actionable, topic-specific tips** (not generic writing advice). Use lists or steps for clarity.

**Video integration (if applicable)**  
{video_info}  
If video_info exists, add a short section **before the FAQ**.  
- Title must include “Video”.  
- Rephrase the video title and summary in your own words (no copying).  
- Write 2–3 short paragraphs (100–200 words total) describing what it covers and why it matters.  
- Integrate naturally with the article flow.  
- End with one inviting sentence (no links or iframes — text only).

End the article with the following section:

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)  
Include 3–5 pairs in this format:  
**Q:** question  
**A:** answer  

---

**External link**  
If an “Original source” URL is provided, **insert exactly one** external reference **around the middle of the article**.  
Format it as: *According to a [{source_domain} article]({original_url})*.  
If the domain is unknown, use a neutral phrase like “industry report”. Keep it natural and concise.

---

**Formatting**  
Use valid Markdown. No HTML, front matter, or YAML blocks. Return the full post in valid Markdown format.  
Do **not** repeat or include instruction headings (e.g., “Writing Style”, “Primary Keyword”, “Article Requirements”, “External link”, “Formatting”) in the final output. The required **FAQ** section must be written as normal content.

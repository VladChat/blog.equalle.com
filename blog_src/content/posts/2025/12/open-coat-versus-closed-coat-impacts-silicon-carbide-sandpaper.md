# Open vs Closed Coat: Silicon Carbide Sandpaper Guide

Saturday morning in the shop is supposed to be simple: one mug of coffee, a walnut desktop to final-sand, and a couple of hours of quiet before the house wakes up. Instead, at pass number fifteen, the paper glazes over. The dust lines smear into the grain, and the sander’s pitch changes—a small but telling protest. I switch sheets, still chasing that consistent, haze-free scratch pattern. When I move to wet-sand a lacquer test panel, silicon carbide sandpaper comes out of the drawer—its black grit and smooth backing a distinct contrast to the tan aluminum oxide I’ve used on the walnut. Ten minutes later, I’m flattening a glued-up end-grain cutting board, then stepping over to clean up a steel plane body. Same sander, same operator, but suddenly my results diverge depending on one detail I often overlook: how densely the abrasive grains were packed onto the paper in the first place.

Open coat versus closed coat sounds like catalog jargon until your paper either loads instantly on resinous pine, or it plows efficiently through hard maple and keeps cutting. The “coat” choice changes how dust evacuates under the pad, how hot the interface gets, how quickly the edges of each grain fracture, and how uniform your scratch pattern ends up. On lacquer, an open coat buys you longer wet-sanding intervals before slurry gels; on metal, a closed coat brings the density you need to maintain a fast rate of cut. In my day job, I measure those differences with force gauges, optical microscopes, and timed passes—but anyone can feel it in the first minute of sanding. If you’ve ever wondered why one sheet lasts and another gums up, this is the physics behind the paper.

> Quick Summary: Open-coat papers leave space between grains to reduce loading and heat on soft or gummy materials; closed-coat papers pack grit densely for faster, more uniform cutting on hard substrates and finishing passes—here’s how to choose, with data.

## What coat percentage really means
Coat density is simply the proportion of the backing covered with abrasive grains. Manufacturers typically land in three bands:
- Open coat: about 50–70% coverage
- Semi-open (or medium) coat: roughly 70–90%
- Closed coat: 90–100% coverage

That percentage isn’t marketing fluff—it dictates how dust and swarf move under pressure. With open coat, voids between grains act like expansion chambers. Softwood resin, paint dust, or plastic swarf has places to go, delaying loading. Less loading means less heat, fewer burned patches, and a more consistent scratch pattern over time. The trade-off is initial aggression: fewer cutting points per square inch means slightly slower stock removal on hard materials.

Closed coat maximizes the number of cutting points. On hard maple, steel, or cured epoxy, more grains engaged at once translates to a higher initial cut rate and a narrower distribution of scratch depths. That uniformity matters when you’re stepping through grits to a final finish or prepping for a coating—random deep grooves are what telegraph through paint.

Two resin layers—the make coat (anchors grains) and size coat (locks them in)—also influence performance. Heavier size coats can resist grain pullout and extend life on aggressive passes but may increase loading on gummy substrates. Some papers add a stearate “supersize” topcoat to reduce clogging; that can be a bigger lever than coat density on paints and soft woods.

In practice:
- Softwoods, pine, cedar, fresh paint, plastics: open or semi-open cuts cooler and lasts longer.
- Hardwoods, metals, cured finishes, flattening tasks: closed coat maintains cut rate and consistency.

Electrostatic grain orientation matters, too. Properly oriented grains stand edge-up, so even an open coat still presents sharp points to the work. That’s why good open-coat paper often outperforms cheap closed-coat paper on both cut and finish.

## Material science of grit and bonding
Coat density is only half the story; the grit’s chemistry dictates how it breaks and stays sharp. Three families dominate:
- Aluminum Oxide (AO): tough, blocky, and microfracture-resistant. It dulls gradually—good for wood stock removal.
- Silicon Carbide (SiC): harder, sharper, and more brittle. It fractures more readily into new cutting edges, excels in fine grits, and thrives in wet-sanding because water carries away the sharp fragments and swarf.
- Alumina Zirconia (AZ): tough with self-sharpening microfracture under heavy pressure—favored for aggressive metal grinding.

In the lab, we measure grit friability (how easily a grain fractures) and observe cutting edges under a microscope after fixed cycles. SiC shows a distinctive “fresh shard” profile over time; AO’s edges round off more predictably. That makes silicon carbide sandpaper ideal for leveling finishes, honing edges in higher grits, and cutting hard, brittle surfaces like glass or stone without excessive pressure.

Bonding resins also change behavior. Phenolic resins withstand heat better than urea formaldehyde, pushing burn thresholds higher during aggressive sanding. The size coat thickness affects whether fractured grit stays in place long enough to keep cutting. On open-coat papers, a thinner size coat plus stearate can be a strategic combination: the coating sheds clog-prone dust while not smearing across the work.

Backing matters. Paper backings (A–F weight) balance flexibility and durability—A/B for curves and finishing, C/D for general sanding, E/F for belts. Film backings give a flat, dimensionally stable surface at high grits (P600+), improving scratch uniformity—particularly with SiC in wet applications. Cloth backings tolerate higher pressure and heat in metalwork.

Wet-sanding changes the thermodynamics and debris field. Water reduces friction, cools the interface, and suspends swarf, effectively increasing the function of “voids” even in closed coat. That’s partly why closed-coat SiC is so effective in P800–P2000 ranges on finishes and automotive clear coats: the slurry evacuates, the grit refreshes, and the scratch pattern tightens.

## When silicon carbide sandpaper outperforms
You’ll notice silicon carbide’s advantage in three scenarios:

- Finishes and coatings: Between coats of lacquer, polyurethane, or epoxy, SiC’s sharp, brittle grains microfracture to maintain cut in fine grits. Coupled with water, it levels nibs quickly without embedding gummy residue. Closed coat in high grits (P800–P1500) delivers uniform, shallow scratches that disappear predictably in the next step or polish.

- Brittle, hard surfaces: On glass, stone, and some ceramics, SiC slices rather than plows. The controlled fracture preserves aggression at the micro-scale where AO tends to rub and heat. Use closed coat for maximum point density, especially with a film backing to maintain flatness.

- Metals and hardened finishes: While AO is great for roughing steel, SiC in higher grits refines the surface faster with less burnishing. On cast iron or stainless at finishing grits, you’ll get a tighter Ra value with fewer passes. Open coat can help on softer alloys or aluminum to mitigate loading, especially with a stearate supersize.

Application-specific notes:
- Automotive clear coat: P1000–P2000 SiC, closed coat, film backing, wet. Expect cleaner slurry and better clarity post-polish.
- Soft resinous woods: For leveling shellac or varnish, open-coat SiC at P320–P600 resists clogging while maintaining a crisp scratch.
- Plastic and acrylic: Open or semi-open SiC wet minimizes heat and reduces edge-melting.

Across these use cases, coat density tunes the interface: open coat buys you time before loading; closed coat maximizes initial contact count for speed and uniformity. Your choice should match the material’s tendency to clog and your need for consistent scratch depth.

*According to a [ article](https://www.sandpaper.com/articles/sandpaper-coatings-demystified/)*, coat density is one of the primary levers for controlling loading and scratch uniformity. In practice, I pair that principle with grit chemistry: open coat plus stearate for anything gummy; closed-coat SiC or film-backed AO for precision finishing when uniformity trumps everything else.

## Test results: wood, paint, and metal
To quantify trade-offs, I ran comparative tests on a linear test rig: 3 lb normal force, 60 strokes/min, 5-minute sets, vacuum extraction at 60 CFM for dry tests, and distilled water with a wetting drop for wet tests. Metrics: mass removed (mg/min), time to 20% torque rise (as a proxy for loading), and scratch uniformity (standard deviation of scratch depth measured via optical profilometry).

Materials and setups:
- Pine (knotty): P120 and P180 AO vs SiC, open vs closed, dry
- Hard maple: P120 and P180 AO vs SiC, closed, dry
- Lacquer panel: P800 and P1200 SiC, open vs closed, wet
- Mild steel: P400 AO vs P400 SiC, closed, dry then wet

Key findings:
- Pine, P120 dry: Open-coat AO removed 14% less material per minute than closed-coat AO but lasted 42% longer before hitting the 20% torque-rise threshold. Open-coat SiC showed a similar pattern, with 11% less cut rate but 37% more time before noticeable loading.
- Hard maple, P120 dry: Closed-coat AO led cut rate by 18% over open-coat AO and maintained a tighter scratch-depth distribution (σ reduced by 12%). SiC and AO at P180 were nearly tied on rate; AO edged out in longevity by ~9%.
- Lacquer, P1200 wet: Closed-coat SiC achieved a smoother surface (Ra 0.22 µm vs 0.26 µm for open-coat) and finished to the same gloss level in 15% fewer passes. However, open-coat SiC extended time between rinse cycles by ~30% before slurry thickening.
- Mild steel, P400: Dry sanding favored closed-coat AO for life (+17%) and rate (+10%). Switching to wet, closed-coat SiC overtook AO in finish quality (Ra improved by 18%) and matched rate within 3%, with fewer directional scratches.

Interpretation:
- On soft, clog-prone materials, open coat is a life-extender and heat reducer, even if it surrenders some speed.
- On hard materials and when finish uniformity matters, closed coat wins—especially in higher grits and with wet sanding.
- Silicon carbide sandpaper’s microfracture keeps fine grits cutting in wet conditions and produces more uniform micro-scratches on finishes and brittle materials.

These deltas appear small on paper but compound across steps. A 10–20% time savings per grit sequence can pull an hour out of a full prep-and-finish workflow.

## Choosing the right coat for your job
Approach coat selection as a constraint-solving exercise: material behavior, removal goal, and finish uniformity.

Decision framework:
- If the material is soft or gummy (pine, MDF primer, acrylic): choose open or semi-open, stearate-coated if dry; go SiC wet for finishing passes.
- If the material is hard and you need speed and uniformity (maple, hardwood veneer, cured epoxy leveling, metal finishing): choose closed coat; pick SiC for wet finishing, AO or AZ for heavy dry stock removal.
- For finishing between coats: closed-coat SiC on film backing in P800–P1500 for uniform scratch; open-coat SiC if your finish tends to clog.

H3: Five field-tested tips
- Start semi-open before going fully open: Semi-open balances speed and anti-loading on borderline substrates like poplar with primer.
- Add wetting early: For silicon carbide at P600+, switch to wet-sanding sooner. A single drop of dish soap per quart of water reduces surface tension and keeps slurry moving.
- Use film backing for leveling: When flatness and scratch uniformity matter (e.g., guitar finishes, table tops), film-backed closed-coat SiC tightens scratch distribution and prevents paper swell.
- Clean, don’t overheat: Use a crepe rubber cleaning stick on dry, open-coat sheets. If the sheet feels hot to the touch, you’re past the efficiency window—change earlier to protect the work.
- Step your grits intelligently: Closed-coat sequences can handle larger jumps (P120→P180→P240). Open-coat sequences benefit from smaller steps to maintain scratch control.

Buying guidance:
- Keep both an open-coat and closed-coat option in common grits (P120, P180, P320).
- For finish work, stock P800–P1500 closed-coat SiC on film; for paint/primer knockdowns, add P220–P400 open-coat stearate paper.

## Care, longevity, and cost math
Abrasive economics improve dramatically when you pair the right coat with the right technique. I track “cost per gram removed” and “cost per square foot to pre-finish” as practical KPIs.

Observed ranges (shop averages):
- Open-coat AO on pine (P120): $0.012–$0.018 per gram removed; higher sheet count but fewer burn marks and rework.
- Closed-coat AO on maple (P120): $0.009–$0.013 per gram; fewer sheet changes, faster progression.
- Closed-coat SiC on lacquer (P1200, wet, film backing): ~$0.06 per square foot per grit to achieve Ra ≤ 0.25 µm; fewer passes offset higher sheet price.
- Closed-coat SiC on glass (P800, wet): Highest per-sheet cost, but the only path to controlled scratch and polish without heat cracks.

Longevity practices:
- Store flat and dry: Humidity warps paper backings, changing contact and scratch pattern. Film backings mitigate this but still prefer flat storage.
- Avoid hard creases on SiC: Its brittle grains microfracture beneficially under load, but creasing pre-breaks the grit, reducing initial aggression.
- Decouple heat: For dry work, reduce pad speed slightly and use vacuum extraction. Heat accelerates resin smear (loading) and dulls edges.
- Clean sensibly: Use a crepe stick on dry wood dust. Don’t use on stearate-coated sheets—let them shed as designed.
- Retire early on finish steps: The last two grits dictate your final surface. Swap sheets at the first sign of scratch inconsistency; the cost of rework dwarfs a fresh sheet.

If you track your own numbers, you’ll likely see the same pattern: open coat stretches life on clog-prone tasks; closed coat tightens scratch and compresses time on hard or finishing tasks; silicon carbide sandpaper in wet, high-grit workflows delivers the most consistent finish per minute.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
**Q:** What’s the difference between open and closed coat in practice?  
**A:** Open coat leaves gaps between grains (about 50–70% coverage) to reduce loading and heat on soft or gummy materials. Closed coat packs grains densely (90–100% coverage) for faster cutting and a more uniform scratch on hard substrates and finishing passes.

**Q:** When should I choose silicon carbide sandpaper over aluminum oxide?  
**A:** Use silicon carbide in higher grits, especially wet, for leveling finishes, refining metals, and working brittle materials like glass. Aluminum oxide is tougher and cost-effective for general wood stock removal in lower to mid grits.

**Q:** Can I wet-sand with both open and closed coat papers?  
**A:** Yes. Wet-sanding benefits both, but closed-coat SiC particularly shines because water carries away swarf while fresh fracture edges keep cutting. Open coat extends time between rinses on finishes that tend to clog.

**Q:** How do I tell coat type if packaging isn’t clear?  
**A:** Look closely: open-coat sheets show visible space between grains and often have a slightly “speckled” look; closed-coat appears uniformly covered. Stearate-coated sheets may look chalky or waxy on top.

**Q:** Does stearate always help with loading?  
**A:** On paints, primers, and soft woods, yes—it reduces clogging. On high-precision finishing (e.g., polishing stages), stearate can interfere if it transfers, so consider non-stearated closed-coat SiC on film for those steps.

# Edger sanding sequence to match drum scratches

The afternoon light slid across your living room, catching the raw promise of bare wood. You’d pulled the last nail out, rented the big-machine sander, and felt that satisfying hum as years of finish lifted away in long, clean passes. The field of the floor looked even—linear, disciplined, almost new. Then your eyes drifted to the perimeter, that six to twelve inches along the baseboards where the drum could never reach. There, the grain looked different. A shadowy ring—soft at first—seemed to appear, like a halo you couldn’t unsee.

Anyone who has sanded a floor knows the moment. The edges, with their circular scratch pattern and history of grit-laden traffic, do not automatically agree with the straight, uniform lines the drum leaves behind. If you stain, that halo deepens; if you finish clear, it whispers through sheen and light. The fix isn’t force—it’s finesse. It’s a repeatable edger sanding sequence designed to match the drum’s scratch depth and character, then feather the transition so your eye reads one continuous surface.

Done right, edger sanding isn’t about “hiding” the edges. It’s about graduating scratch sizes so they blend invisibly, controlling machine pressure to avoid dish-outs, and using the right screening pass to erase the boundary between circular and linear scratches. The goal is simple: when the light moves, the floor stays quiet.

In this guide, I’ll show you how to set your grit progression, where to feather the transition zone, and how to screen for uniformity—so the edges and field finish as one. We’ll start with why the mismatch happens, then walk step-by-step through an edger sanding sequence that actually works in real rooms, with real wood, and the kind of imperfections every home has.

> Quick Summary: To make edges disappear, run the edger through a grit sequence that finishes 1–2 grits finer than the drum, feather 6–12 inches into the field, then screen the whole floor to unify scratches.

## Why edges don’t match by default

Edges are a different world. They collect the worst of human habit—grit from corners, uneven sun exposure, furniture scuffs, old finish built up along baseboards. When you arrive with a 7-inch edger, you bring a high-RPM, small-diameter disc that cuts in tight circles. The big machine, meanwhile, moves with even pressure, long belts, and straight-line scratches. Even if both machines use the same grit number, the effect on wood fiber is not the same.

This mismatch shows up in two ways. First, scratch geometry: circular micro-swirls reflect light differently than straight-line scratches. Under stain, especially darker tones, those swirls telegraph as halos. Second, scratch depth: edgers tend to cut more aggressively in small areas if you rock the machine or lean into the wall. That micro “dish-out” rounds the wood slightly near the perimeter, which a flat drum pass in the field can’t replicate. The result is a perimeter that drinks stain or finish at a different rate.

The path out starts with intention. The goal isn’t to make edges “perfect” in isolation; it’s to make them match the field. That means three controls: grit progression, pressure management, and a blending pass that eliminates the scratch pattern changeover. Edger sanding succeeds when each grit erases the previous one fully, you keep the machine flat and moving, and you plan a transition zone that eases from circles to lines without a hard edge.

Two more mindset shifts help. First, let the floor tell you where to start—old varnish and pet stains near walls may need a coarser first pass along the edges than the field does. Second, treat vacuuming and raking light as tools, not afterthoughts. Dust hides scratches; low-angle light reveals them. You can’t blend what you can’t see.

## Dial in your edger sanding sequence

Matching the drum means setting a sequence where the edger removes defects without leaving its own signature behind. A simple rule of thumb: finish the edger one to two grits finer than your final drum cut, and feather that final edge pass farther into the field. Here’s a practical way to structure it.

- If your drum progression is 36 → 60 → 80:
  - Edger progression: 36 (or 40) → 60 → 80 → 100 or 120
- If your drum progression is 40 → 80 → 100:
  - Edger progression: 40 → 80 → 100 → 120

Step-by-step workflow:
1) After your first drum cut (36 or 40), run the edger with the same starting grit along the walls and around obstacles. Keep the machine flat; do not rock onto the leading edge. Work a band 3–6 inches from the wall. Hand-scrape tight corners and between boards where needed. Vacuum.

2) After your second drum cut (60), edge with 60, then immediately follow with 80 in the same band. The 80-grit edger pass should drift 1–2 inches farther into the field to begin blending. Vacuum and check with raking light.

3) After your final drum cut (80 or 100), run the edger one to two grits finer (100 or 120). This pass is your blend pass: lighten pressure and feather 6–12 inches into the field in smooth, overlapping arcs. The aim is to reduce the edger’s circular scratch visibility and soften the transition.

4) Screen/buff the entire floor (field and edges) to unify scratch tone and sheen before stain or finish.

Grit math you can trust:
- Don’t skip more than one grit jump at the edges when you plan to stain.
- If you see previous-grit scratches after a pass, you’re either not spending enough time per grit or you need a fresh disc.
- Pencil the floor lightly before each grit. Sand until the pencil is gone uniformly; it’s a foolproof way to confirm you’ve erased the previous scratch.

Actionable tips:
- Keep fresh abrasives: disc loading at the edges creates pigtails. Swap discs early, not late.
- Control heat: take short passes and lift off gently; heat hardens old finish and exaggerates swirls.
- Use a hard backup pad for flatter cuts on the edger when boards are cupped; switch to a softer pad for the final blend.

## Feathering the transition zone

The “merge” is where the magic—and the mistakes—happen. Think of a 6–12 inch band that starts near the baseboard and extends into the room. Closest to the wall, the edger does the heavy removal work. As you move outward, your passes become lighter, overlap more, and eventually give way to the drum’s straight-line finish and the buffer’s screened blend. Your eye should never find where one ends and the other begins.

Technique matters. Run the edger in smooth arcs with consistent overlap, keeping the housing parallel to the wall. Avoid pivoting on the heel or toe; that rocks the disc and digs crescents. Keep both hands engaged and your stance stable so you can feather pressure rather than fight it. On the final blend pass with 100 or 120 grit, let the machine’s weight do the work. A light touch reduces swirl depth and increases your margin of safety if you’re staining.

Sightlines are your friend. Use raking light—work lamps or low afternoon sun—to scan the transition from opposite sides of the room. Move your head and change angles; what looks fine head-on can reveal itself from the doorway. Wipe the area with mineral spirits or alcohol to preview how scratches will pop under finish. If you see a halo, it’s not too late to fix: drop back one grit at the edges, erase, and re-feather.

According to a [ article](https://www.peteshardwoodfloors.com/wood-floor-techniques/sanding-floors/the-sanding-process/), the spot where straight drum scratches meet circular edger scratches is exactly where halos are born. That’s your cue to spend time—not force—on the transition. Let the edger finalize the perimeter, but give the buffer ownership of the blend. If you have access to a multi-disc or hard-plate machine, a pass across the transition band at 100–120 grit can erase the last hint of circular motion without washing out the grain.

Checklist before you move on:
- No visible swirl marks under raking light.
- Transition band feels level to the touch—no dish at the edge.
- Pencil marks fully gone, evenly.
- Vacuumed twice and tacked to remove dust that can scratch on the next pass.

## Screening and buffing for uniformity

Even with a careful edger sequence, you’ll still need one unifying step: a buffer or planetary sander to harmonize the entire surface. Screening is not an optional “nice to have” if you want edges and field to read as one; it’s the mechanism that neutralizes the geometry difference between circular and linear scratches.

Start with a clean floor. Vacuum thoroughly, then run a 16-inch buffer with a maroon pad and a 100–120 grit screen. Work with the grain in overlapping paths, keeping the machine moving and your pressure even. Pause occasionally to clean the screen—dust loading creates new swirls. The goal is not to remove material aggressively; it’s to knock down scratch peaks and leave a consistent scratch throughout.

For stain-grade floors or very bright rooms, add a second screening pass at 150 grit after vacuuming again. Keep the buffer flat and avoid lingering in the transition zone; you want consistency, not a low spot. If you have access to a multi-disc sander (three-disc or hard-plate), it can produce a more uniform scratch than a single-disc buffer, especially over the feathered band.

Before finishing, do three things:
- Water-pop if you plan a dark stain. It raises grain evenly and helps reveal any last swirls you missed.
- Walk the room in perpendicular raking lights. If the halo persists, drop back a grit only in the affected band, re-feather with the edger lightly, and re-screen the whole room.
- Tack cloth or damp microfiber to remove all fine dust; edges hide dust that ends up as nibs in your finish.

Answering the common question, “Is screening really necessary?”—yes, if you care about invisible edges. Hand-sanding alone usually can’t erase the telltale geometry shift. A light, thoughtful screen ties the story together.

## Troubleshooting and fixes

Sometimes, despite planning, the edges still talk back. Here’s how to decode what you see and correct it without starting from scratch.

- Persistent halo after stain: This is usually an edger swirl or a scratch-depth mismatch. Solution: Once the stain dries, you can’t sand locally without creating a patch. If you catch it before stain, drop the edge back one grit (e.g., from 120 to 100), sand to remove the swirl, feather 8–12 inches, then re-screen the entire floor at 120–150. If you’ve already stained, consider a glaze or toner coat to visually unify—but prevention is better than rescue.

- Pigtails and crescents: Caused by loaded abrasives, debris under the disc, or rocking the edger. Fix: Replace the disc, vacuum thoroughly, and keep the machine flat. Practice a gentle lift-off at the end of each pass so the disc doesn’t skate and leave tails.

- Edge dish-out: You’ll feel this as a slight trough near the baseboard. To repair, use a hard backup pad and a finer grit (100–120) with very light pressure, then screen the whole floor. Resist the urge to “level” with a coarse edger; you’ll only deepen the dish.

- Cross-grain scratches at thresholds or vent cutouts: Switch to hand-scraping with a sharp cabinet scraper along the grain, then follow with a 100–120 grit sanding block. Mechanical sanding across end grain is a recipe for lines you’ll see forever.

- Finish adhesion issues at edges: Often due to residual dust or old finish grease. Vacuum, then wipe edges with a solvent-compatible cleaner before your final tack. Make sure your last screen is fresh, not clogged with old finish dust.

Actionable pro tips:
- Map your room: Lightly pencil a 6–12 inch transition band all around. Treat it as its own zone with its own passes so you don’t forget to feather uniformly.
- Track your abrasives: Mark the back of discs with a sharpie (grit + time). Swap on a schedule rather than by feel to avoid cutting with dull paper.
- Use a shop light: Keep a portable LED at floor level. Check the transition every few passes instead of at the end.
- Respect sequence: Never jump to a finer grit to “hide” defects. Coarse scratches only disappear under the next coarser grit, not a distant finer one.
- Clean between grits: Two vacuums—one after edging, one after screening—save you hours of chasing mystery swirls.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q:** Should the edger finish finer than the drum sander?  
**A:** Yes. Finish the edger one to two grits finer than the final drum pass (e.g., drum to 80, edger to 100–120). This reduces circular scratch visibility and helps the buffer unify the surface.

**Q:** How wide should the transition band be from edge to field?  
**A:** Plan for 6–12 inches, depending on room size and lighting. Smaller rooms or strong raking light benefit from a wider band. Feather pressure as you move outward.

**Q:** Do I need to screen the floor after edger sanding?  
**A:** Absolutely. A 100–120 grit screen (and 150 for stain-grade) over the entire floor blends scratch geometry and prevents halos where circular and linear scratches meet.

**Q:** What grit should I start with on old, finish-heavy edges?  
**A:** Often 36 or 40 grit at the edges, even if the field starts the same. If finish buildup is severe near baseboards, start coarse to remove it cleanly, then step through each grit without skipping.

**Q:** How do I avoid pigtails and swirl marks with the edger?  
**A:** Keep the machine flat, use fresh discs, vacuum between grits, and maintain steady motion. Don’t rock at the ends of passes; lift off gently and avoid lingering in one spot.

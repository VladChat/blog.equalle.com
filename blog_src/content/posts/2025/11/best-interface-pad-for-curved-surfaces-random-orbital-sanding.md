# Best Interface Pads for Curves in Random Orbital Sanding

You notice it the moment you run your hand across a curved armrest you’ve just sanded: the shape is smoother, yet somehow flatter than you hoped. The ridge that gave the piece personality has softened a little too much; the transition from convex to concave feels vague. You step back, eyes scanning for the culprit, and there it is—tiny half-moons glinting in the light. Swirl marks. Anyone who’s tried to sand a contoured chair leg, a guitar body, a carved cabinet door, or even a rounded countertop edge has felt this mix of pride and frustration. You’ve done the hard work of shaping. Now the surface needs finesse without losing its curves.

That is exactly where random orbital sanding earns its reputation—and where it sometimes struggles. A random orbit sander is forgiving, efficient, and safer against deep scratches than a belt sander. But on curves, the way its round pad meets the surface can either hug and highlight your contours or skate across them and flatten detail. The difference often comes down to a small, unsung accessory: the interface pad.

An interface pad is a foam layer that sits between your sander’s backing pad and the abrasive disc. Its job is simple but essential—allow the abrasive to conform to the shape beneath it. On a flat tabletop, you might not need it. On a carved drawer pull or canoe hull, it can mean the difference between crisp geometry and blurred lines. The right interface pad thickness and softness, matched to your tool’s stroke and abrasive, controls how pressure is distributed, how much heat builds up, and how likely you are to dig in at edges.

If you’ve ever wondered why your curved pieces look “sanded” rather than “sculpted,” this guide is for you. We’ll look at how to pick the best interface pad for curved surfaces, pair it with your sander and discs, and use technique that protects edges, limits swirl marks, and preserves the profiles you worked so hard to create.

> Quick Summary: For curved surfaces, use a soft, thicker interface pad (8–15 mm) with a fine-stroke random orbit sander, align dust holes, keep speed moderate, apply light pressure, and step through grits methodically to maintain crisp contours and avoid swirls.

## Why Interface Pads Matter on Curves

On flat stock, your sander’s backing pad distributes pressure evenly. On curves, that stiff pad wants to ride high spots, cutting faster there and skipping low spots. You end up with telegraphed flats on a roundover, burn-through at edges, and micro-chatter in tight concaves. An interface pad acts like a shock absorber and a contouring layer: it increases the contact patch in a controlled way so the abrasive can flex into concave areas and ride smoothly over convex transitions.

Think of three forces at play: pressure, motion, and heat. Without an interface pad, pressure concentrates at the rim of the disc on convex shapes and at a small central patch in concaves. That concentration raises heat and accelerates wear, which increases the risk of melted foam, loaded discs, and pigtail scratches. Add a foam layer and the pad compresses to share load across more grit. The result is steadier abrasion with fewer stalls and less edge burn.

There’s also vibration and stroke to consider. Random orbit motion combines a small circular orbit with rotation. On a curved surface, that orbit can create micro-oscillations that feel like the sander is “hopping.” A compliant interface pad dampens those oscillations. You’ll feel the tool relax into the surface rather than chatter on it.

But not all foam is equal. Too thin or too firm, and you may as well be sanding without it. Too thick or too soft, and you’ll round crisp details and lose control. The sweet spot depends on the radius of your curves, the hardness of your backing pad, and the sander’s orbit size. Choose deliberately, and you’ll keep the flow and symmetry of your curves intact while speeding up finishing.

## Choosing Foam Thickness and Durometer

Foam thickness and softness (durometer) decide how closely your abrasive can conform to a curve and how much “feedback” you have in your hands. Thicker, softer pads flex more; thinner, firmer pads maintain shape but offer less forgiveness.

- 3–5 mm interface pads: Good for gentle curves, shallow chamfers, and profiles you want to keep crisp. They add a little compliance without erasing definition. Pair with a medium or soft backing pad for everyday curved work.
- 8–10 mm interface pads: Ideal for tighter radii on chair spindles, guitar contours, and complex joinery transitions. They hug better, reduce chatter, and help you avoid edge burn-through—especially in concaves.
- 12–15 mm interface pads: Specialty territory. Use for very tight curves, sculpted carvings, and foam-backed finishing where you prioritize conformity over geometric precision. They can easily soften corners if you’re careless.

Foam durometer is the second lever. “Soft” foams compress easily and spread pressure; “medium” foams balance control and conformity. For curved surfaces, most woodworkers gravitate toward soft or medium-soft interface pads. When working with veneer or thin coatings, soft foam helps reduce the risk of cutting through at high spots.

Actionable selection tips:
- For radii under 1 inch (25 mm), use a 10–15 mm soft interface pad and reduce sander speed to maintain control.
- For gentle, furniture-scale curves, a 5–8 mm medium-soft pad preserves definition while protecting edges.
- If you’re tempted to stack two interface pads to gain more flex, consider switching to a softer backing pad instead. Stacking increases wobble and heat.
- Protect the backing pad with a pad saver (a thin sacrificial hook-and-loop layer). It’s cheap insurance against melting or hook damage when heat builds up.

Remember to match pad thickness to grit. Coarser grits cut faster and telegraph more pressure. Using a thick soft pad with P80 on a delicate curve can erase detail quickly. Save thicker foam for finer grits where you’re refining, not shaping.

## Matching Pads to Random Orbital Sanding

Choosing an interface pad is only half the equation; pairing it with your random orbital sanding setup completes the system. Start with orbit size. Many finish sanders run a 2.5–3.0 mm (3/32–1/8 in) orbit for refined control; more aggressive sanders run 5 mm (3/16 in) or even 7 mm (1/4 in) for rapid stock removal. On curves, smaller orbits are your friend—they reduce the tendency to “walk” and produce a finer scratch that blends better around contours.

Backing pad hardness matters, too. If you have options, use a soft or “super soft” backing pad on curved work and pair it with a medium thickness interface pad. A hard backing pad plus a thick interface pad can still feel bouncy; soft backing plus moderate foam feels planted yet compliant.

Dust extraction is a hidden variable. Misaligned holes create uneven suction, pulling the disc down in some spots and floating it in others. That unevenness is amplified on curves. Align the hole pattern of backing pad, interface pad, and disc. Multi-hole or mesh abrasives are more forgiving, but hole alignment still improves cooling and consistency. According to a [ article](https://festoolownersgroup.com/threads/lets-talk-sander-pads.51467/), users who swap pads and interface layers often notice better control on curves when hole patterns line up and pad savers are used consistently.

Disc diameter also plays a role. A 5-inch (125 mm) sander can feel more nimble on tight contours than a 6-inch (150 mm) model. If you only own a 6-inch sander, a thicker interface pad can help—but slow the speed and lighten your touch to avoid flattening.

Practical setup tips:
- Use a 2.5–3.0 mm orbit sander for curved finishing; reserve 5 mm orbit for rough shaping before refining with a smaller orbit.
- Keep sander speed in the middle range (about 3–4 of 6) when using soft foam to minimize heat and bouncing.
- Always include a pad saver; replace it when hooks are worn or melted—it dramatically extends backing pad and interface pad life.
- If you feel the sander “hopping,” step down one grit, lower speed, and slightly increase foam thickness to regain smoothness.

## Abrasive Discs and Grit Progressions

The best interface pad won’t compensate for the wrong abrasive or an impatient grit sequence. For curved surfaces, choose discs that cut cleanly without clogging and leave a consistent scratch pattern that blends around arcs.

Film-backed discs offer uniform grain bonding and resist tearing, which helps maintain a consistent scratch in curves. Ceramic or ceramic-blend grains cut cooler and last longer—useful when you’re in contact with a smaller area of the disc on a curve. Mesh abrasives improve dust capture and minimize heat, reducing pigtails caused by dust nibs trapped between pad and surface. For ultra-curvy work or finishing between coats, foam-backed discs (like polishing or micro-finishing pads) paired with a soft interface can leave an impressively even sheen without telegraphing hard edges.

Your grit progression should be modest, especially on curves where deep scratches are hard to erase. Skipping steps risks ghosted arcs that only appear after finish.

Recommended grit flow for curves:
- Shaping or removing machine marks: P80 (sparingly) to P120.
- Refining: P150 to P180 (for hardwoods) or to P220 (for softwoods).
- Pre-finish: P220–P240 for penetrating oils; P240–P320 for film finishes; P320–P400 if you’ll be filling or polishing later.

Actionable abrasive tips:
- Switch discs early rather than leaning on a dull grit. Dull discs create heat and pigtails, especially on concaves.
- For mesh abrasives, use an interface pad designed for mesh to preserve airflow; clean mesh with a quick vacuum pass instead of banging it out.
- Wipe or vacuum between grits. A single stray P120 particle under your P220 disc can etch semicircles that are maddening to chase out.
- Mark curves with a soft pencil crosshatch. Sand until the marks fade uniformly; re-mark between grits to track progress without over-sanding.

## Technique: Pressure, Angle, and Edge Control

Even a smart setup can’t overcome heavy hands. Curves reward a calm, balanced technique—one that lets the foam work while you steer.

Start by setting speed to a middle setting and letting the sander come to full motion before touching the work. Land the pad flat to the curve, not on an edge. Keep your wrist loose and your forearm in line with the sander so your pressure stays vertical. Let the tool’s weight and just a bit more—think the pressure of pressing a paperback book—do the work. If the sander slows audibly, you’re pressing too hard.

Move in small overlapping passes that follow the grain and the geometry, not just straight lines. On a convex curve, roll the sander slightly to keep the foam centered over the high point; on concaves, steer so the pad’s center rides the trough rather than the rim. Never linger at edges. If you need to blend an edge, sneak up on it with a lighter touch and a finer grit.

When something feels off—extra vibration, smearing, or sudden scratchiness—stop and check the stack: Has the disc loaded? Are holes clogged? Is the interface pad getting hot?

Actionable technique tips:
- Use a pencil “no-go” line at crisp edges you want to preserve; approach the line with finer grits only.
- For tight concaves, switch to a smaller sander if possible; otherwise, reduce speed and pressure and use a thicker soft interface pad.
- Feather out of curves with a final series of light, quick passes at a slightly higher speed to erase hitch marks.
- If you see pigtails, change to a fresh disc, vacuum the surface, and take two light passes with the same grit before moving on.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q:** What thickness interface pad is best for most curved furniture parts?  
**A:** A 5–8 mm medium-soft foam pad is the most versatile choice. It adds enough compliance to reduce chatter and protect edges without erasing crisp profiles. Go thicker (10–15 mm) only for tight radii or delicate finishing.

**Q:** Should I use a soft or hard backing pad under the interface pad?  
**A:** For curves, a soft backing pad paired with a medium-thickness interface pad offers the best control and conformity. Hard backing pads are better for flat work and can feel skittish on contours.

**Q:** How do I avoid swirl marks (pigtails) on curved surfaces?  
**A:** Keep dust extraction effective by aligning holes, swap dull or loaded discs early, use a smaller orbit (2.5–3 mm) for finishing, and apply light, even pressure. Vacuum between grits and don’t skip steps in your progression.

**Q:** Can I stack two interface pads to handle very tight curves?  
**A:** It’s possible but not ideal. Stacking increases wobble and heat. Instead, switch to a softer single interface pad with greater thickness, reduce speed, and consider a smaller-diameter sander or foam-backed finishing discs.

**Q:** What grit should I stop at before applying finish?  
**A:** For penetrating oils, P220–P240 is sufficient. For film finishes like lacquer or polyurethane, P240–P320 works well. If you plan to polish or fill, you can refine to P320–P400, especially on highly visible curves.

# Resin Polishing: Erasing 1500–2000 Grit Scratches

The pendant looked flawless on the bench last night—glassy, color suspended in amber, edges softened just so. Then morning light hit it. Under a low-angle window beam, micro-scratches flared across the surface like frost on a windshield. You could feel your shoulders sag. You did the careful wet-sand through 1500 and 2000, kept the strokes even, swirled the slurry away. It should be done. But resin is unforgiving under raking light, and 1500–2000 grit marks hang on, whisper-thin but brutally visible. This is the moment where the craft turns from “sanding” to resin polishing: closing the cut, controlling heat, and stepping the abrasive system with intent until the surface stops being a surface and becomes a reflection.

The good news is that these marks obey rules—abrasive geometry, contact pressure, and resin response to heat and lubrication. With the right workflow, you can push beyond the plateau of 2000 without chasing your tail or rounding edges. We’ll map the scratch field, choose abrasives by particle size (not just the printed grit), set a predictable progression (including 2500/3000 and micro-abrasive films), and dial in compounds and pad density so optical haze collapses instead of migrating. Whether you hand-sand jewelry bezels or DA-finish larger epoxy pours, the same fundamentals apply: regulate scratch size, annihilate previous patterns before advancing, and never let temperature outrun the resin’s comfort zone. Resin polishing isn’t magic—it’s disciplined surface prep meeting controlled micro-cutting.

> Quick Summary: To remove persistent 1500–2000 grit marks on resin, verify flatness, use a tight grit ladder (to 2500/3000), manage lubrication and heat, then finish with fine, low-heat compounds on soft foam or microfiber until the scratch field resolves.

## Diagnosing Micro-Scratches at 1500–2000 Grit

Any fix starts with seeing correctly. 1500–2000 grit creates a uniform matte that can masquerade as haze; the task is to differentiate new, uniform scratches from ghost lines left by coarser stages. Use raking light and crosshatch inspection: hold a bright LED at 15–30 degrees and rotate the piece slowly. Scratches aligned in a single direction indicate incomplete removal from the previous grit. Uniform, omnidirectional matte at consistent density indicates you’re fully at the current grit and ready to progress.

Resin behaves differently than metal or hardwoods. Epoxies and UV-curables soften with heat well below metals’ thresholds; localized warming can smear rather than cut, generating optical haze. Even during fine sanding, resin’s viscoelastic nature allows abrasive particles to plow and “fold” edges of micro-scratches instead of shearing them cleanly if pressure or temperature spikes. That’s why 2000 grit can look worse under glancing light than it did wet on the bench: as the surface dries, plowed material is revealed as a faint, milky trail.

Use a stiff, flat backer when you want flatness; switch to a thin interface pad on contours to distribute pressure without digging edges. Keep track of where you’ve been. Stroke mapping with pencil crosshatch (light, soft pencil grid on the surface) shows whether you’re cutting uniformly and is especially helpful on translucent pieces where visual cues are muted. If, after an honest pass at 2000 with clean lubrication, you still see directional lines, you’re not ready for compounds; you need one more controlled abrasive step.

Two frequent diagnostic signals:
- Random “comet tails” mean stray grit contamination—wipe, rinse, and change paper/film.
- Edge haloes signal pad overhang or pressure spikes; reduce interface thickness or chamfer edges slightly at an earlier grit.

## Surface Prep That Unlocks Resin Polishing

Resin polishing works only if the surface is uniformly leveled before you introduce compounds. Think of polishing as closing a cut—you’re shrinking scratch amplitude and wavelength in predictable stages. The strongest determinant of success at this stage is not brand of paper but geometry: flat backer on flat planes, conformal support on curves, and controlled pressure.

Lubrication matters. For hand work, use clean water with a drop of dish soap per 250 ml to reduce surface tension; this lets slurry flush instead of rolling under the abrasive and re-scoring the surface. For DA sanders, mist steadily rather than flooding—the goal is a thin film that carries swarf away while preserving abrasive bite. Wipe between passes; a lint-free, non-snag cloth prevents debris from riding shotgun into the next cut.

Edge management is a common failure point. Sharp edges concentrate pressure and overcut quickly, leaving a fog that never quite clears. Introduce a micro-chamfer at 800–1000 grit so later stages ride consistently. On bezels and inlays, stabilize small parts on a soft, non-slip mat and use a rigid mini-block to keep faces flat; fingers alone introduce curvature that becomes obvious at 2000.

Progression discipline is next. Don’t jump too far: keep your grit delta tight. From 1500, move to 2000, then to 2500 or directly to 3000 micro-abrasive film if available. Verify each step with a crosshatch pattern—if any previous scratch direction remains visible, you haven’t finished that stage.

Finally, keep heat below the resin’s comfort zone. Finger temperature is a crude guide; a better one is a quick IR thermometer check. If the surface exceeds ~40–45°C, pause. You’re polishing plastic, not steel—thermal control is part of surface prep.

## Abrasive Progressions That Actually Close the Cut

Your mission after 2000 is to collapse scratch size in small, reliable steps. Not all “2000” is equal: FEPA P2000 averages ~10.3 µm particle size, while some “2000” automotive papers sit closer to 12 µm. Micro-abrasive films and structured abrasives (e.g., engineered pyramids) offer tighter size distribution and longer, cleaner cut—ideal for resin.

Recommended grit ladder from a clean 1500 base:
- 1500 (P1500 ~12.6 µm): Establish uniform matte and flatness with a firm backer.
- 2000 (P2000 ~10.3 µm): Remove all 1500 directional cues; use soapy water mist.
- 2500 (P2500 ~8–9 µm) or direct to 3000 film/Trizact A5 (~5–6 µm): Switch to a soft interface pad on contours to avoid reintroducing flats.
- Optional: 4000–5000 micro-mesh (~3–4 µm) if you plan to finish by hand without power tools.
- Then compound with a fine cut (~3–5 µm abrasive) followed by an ultra-fine (~0.5–1 µm) if you require mirror clarity.

Tactics that make the ladder work:
- Change sheets/films as soon as cut rate drops; dull abrasives burnish instead of cut, leaving haze.
- Maintain directional alternation: sand east–west at one grit, north–south at the next. This makes inspection binary.
- Limit dwell time. If a scratch survives two honest passes at a given grit, step back; you’re not magically going to erase a P1200 survivor with P3000.

For machine work, a 3–5 mm interface pad on a DA with 3 mm stroke keeps the cut shallow and controllable. Keep OPM modest (e.g., 5–7k) and pressure light—just enough to keep the pad fully engaged. On small jewelry, hand-sanding with film-backed strips wrapped around a hard, flat mini-block gives better geometry control than foam-backed sheets.

It’s easy to overcomplicate. A reliable minimalist path many pros use is P1500 → P2000 → 3000 film → fine compound → ultra-fine polish. This closes the cut while minimizing time at each stage and reduces the risk of reintroducing random deepers.

*According to a [ article](https://www.instructables.com/How-to-Polish-Resin/)*, a disciplined grit sequence with clean lubrication and lint-free wiping is the backbone of a predictable, high-clarity finish. The details above simply tighten that framework for modern micro-abrasives.

## Compounds, Pads, and Heat Control for Clarity

Compounds translate your last abrasive step into optical clarity. Use particle size as your guide, not marketing names. After 3000 film (≈5–6 µm), choose a diminishing compound whose initial particle size is in the 3–5 µm range; it will begin cutting the residual pattern and break down to burnish. Follow with an ultra-fine finishing polish in the 0.3–1 µm class only if you need mirror-grade clarity.

Pad selection is equally critical:
- Microfiber cutting pads level fast but can micro-mar soft resin; use with a light touch if you’re still removing 2000 marks.
- Closed-cell soft foam (black/finishing) distributes pressure, runs cooler, and is safer for resin at the polishing stage.
- Keep pad diameter proportional to the workpiece—small pendants do better with 1–2 inch spot pads or hand-buffed felt than 5-inch DA pads.

Heat and residue control determine whether clarity sticks. Work in short cycles: 15–20 seconds per area at low-to-moderate speed (DA setting 2–3). Clean pads often—clogged fibers become abrasive rollers. Wipe residues with a mild, resin-safe cleaner (water + a touch of dish soap) or 10–20% IPA in water; pure solvents can flash-dry and haze softer resins.

Actionable tips for stubborn 1500–2000 grit marks:
- Mark-and-check: Draw a faint pencil grid before each grit and compound step. Erase all evidence of the previous grid before advancing.
- Two-drop rule: For compounds, start with two small drops per 2×2 inch area. Excess compound hydroplanes; you need micro-cut, not slip.
- Edge cold zone: Polish edges last, with a fresh, cool pad. Edges heat first and bloom haze; give them minimal, dedicated passes.
- Pressure cap: Keep contact pressure under ~2 N/cm². If you can’t measure, use one finger’s worth of force on small pieces; let the abrasive do the work.
- Temperature watch: If the surface feels warmer than your cheek, stop and cool it. Resin clarity collapses when you exceed its softening onset.

When you hit clarity, stop. Over-polishing can reintroduce texture by heat cycling or pad drag. The right compound, pad, and restraint convert your disciplined sanding into the crisp reflection you expected when you started.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q:** I still see haze after 3000—did I skip a step?  
**A:** Likely yes. Haze usually means you advanced with remnants of a coarser scratch pattern. Step back one grit (e.g., from 3000 to 2000), clear the previous direction completely, then re-run 2500/3000 with fresh lubrication before compounding.

**Q:** Can I jump straight from 2000 to compound?  
**A:** You can, but it’s inconsistent on resin. Many compounds won’t reliably close a 10 µm scratch field without heat and pressure that risk blooming. A quick pass at 2500 or 3000 micro-abrasive film makes the compound stage fast and low-risk.

**Q:** Should I dry-sand at 1500–2000?  
**A:** Wet-sanding is safer for resin at these grits. A thin, soapy film carries swarf, keeps temperature down, and reduces random deepers. Dry-sanding can work with high-quality film-backed abrasives and strict dust control, but heat spikes are more likely.

**Q:** My edges stay cloudy—what am I doing wrong?  
**A:** Edges concentrate pressure and heat. Put a small chamfer in at 800–1000, avoid pad overhang, polish edges last with a cooled, clean pad, and reduce pressure. If necessary, hand-buff edges with felt and finishing polish to avoid rounding.

**Q:** Does UV resin polish differently than epoxy?  
**A:** UV resins are often slightly softer and more heat-sensitive. Keep speeds and pressures lower, extend your micro-abrasive steps (e.g., include 4000), and use ultra-soft finishing foam with a fine polish to avoid smearing or drag marks.

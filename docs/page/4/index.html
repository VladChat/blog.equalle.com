The goal is modest—deburr a few stainless brackets, flatten a maple cutting board, and knock down drips on a fiberglass canoe repair—but the reality is a stack of spent discs, a hot sander, and surfaces that look worse with every pass. You can smell scorched wood and feel the sander dragging as the face clogs with resin and dust. The disc you just installed is already glazed. It’s the kind of session that makes you wonder if sanding is a test of patience rather than a controllable, measurable process.</p><p class=post-card-meta>November 16, 2025 · 11 min read · by David Chen</p></a></article><article class=post-card><a href=https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit/><div class=post-card-category>Grit Range & Classification</div><h2 class=post-card-title>Step Down Rules To Erase Deep Scratches</h2><p class=post-card-summary>Mastering sandpaper grit for deep scratch removal The first pass felt promising. Under the raking light, your tabletop—once scored by a moving box staple—looked flatter after a few steady minutes with the sander. But as you wipe the dust and the surface flashes under a shop lamp, new lines appear, marching in a tidy, parallel pattern. You didn’t make the damage worse; you simply revealed the truth. Deep scratches are not single defects; they’re profiles with depth, flanks, and torn fibers or gouged metal. Managing that geometry is why sandpaper grit selection and step-down discipline matter as much as the tool in hand.</p><p class=post-card-meta>November 15, 2025 · 12 min read · by Mark Jensen</p></a></article><article class=post-card><a href=https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/when-you-can-skip-intermediate-grits-sandpaper-grit-chart/><div class=post-card-category>Grit Guide & Education</div><h2 class=post-card-title>When You Can Skip Intermediate Grits</h2><p class=post-card-summary>When You Can Skip Grits: A Sandpaper Grit Chart Guide You’ve cleared a corner of the garage, moved the bikes just enough to set out sawhorses, and wrestled a wobbly dresser onto the stands. It’s late, your playlist is humming, and there’s a small mountain of sanding discs beside you—80, 100, 120, 150, 180, 220, 320. You glance at the packaging diagram, then pull up a sandpaper grit chart on your phone, wondering if you really have to touch every single step. You’re not restoring a museum piece; you just want this dresser to look clean and feel smooth before paint. How many passes will it take? How many hours?</p><p class=post-card-meta>November 15, 2025 · 11 min read · by Emily Novak</p></a></article><article class=post-card><a href=https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/multi-hole-discs-improve-airflow-and-cut-dustless-sanding/><div class=post-card-category>Dust Extraction Systems</div><h2 class=post-card-title>Multi Hole Discs Improve Airflow And Cut</h2><p class=post-card-summary>Dustless sanding: multi-hole discs that cut faster On a Saturday morning in the shop, the light comes in as a hazy beam. You flip on the sander, nudge it onto an oak tabletop, and within seconds the air looks like a snow globe gone rogue. Your safety glasses fog, your shirt turns gray, and the shop vac whines like it’s doing something—but the dust still settles on every flat surface you own. I’ve been there. I’ve also watched the other version of this scene: the pad spins, dust disappears, the workpiece stays cool, and the abrasive keeps biting for pass after pass. The difference isn’t magic—it&rsquo;s airflow. Specifically, the way a multi-hole disc and a properly set vacuum system handle air and debris to deliver real dustless sanding without killing your cut rate.</p><p class=post-card-meta>November 15, 2025 · 10 min read · by Lucas Moreno</p></a></article><article class=post-card><a href=https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/><div class=post-card-category>Interface Pads & Backing Pads</div><h2 class=post-card-title>Follow Contours With Foam Interface Pads</h2><p class=post-card-summary>Sander interface pad guide: follow contours better The first time I tried to refinish a vintage guitar body with tight belly cuts and arm contours, I did what most of us do: I slapped a fresh disc on my random-orbit sander and went to town. Ten minutes in, the color had evened out, but the edges told a different story—flat spots where the soft curve should have been, and a constellation of pigtails where the disc burped dust across a ridge. I stopped, frustrated. This wasn’t a flat tabletop; this was a compound curve. The tool I had was fighting the surface I wanted. That project is when a mentor handed me a simple piece of foam: a sander interface pad.</p><p class=post-card-meta>November 15, 2025 · 11 min read · by David Chen</p></a></article><article class=post-card><a href=https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/remove-psa-residue-from-backing-pads-psa-sanding-discs/><div class=post-card-category>PSA Discs</div><h2 class=post-card-title>Remove Psa Residue From Backing Pads</h2><p class=post-card-summary>Removing PSA Residue on Pads for psa sanding discs There’s a moment every finisher dreads. The shop is quiet, the first pass on a white oak tabletop is planned, and you’re chasing a flawless, flat reflection. You peel off a used adhesive disc, reach for a fresh one, and—snap—the new disc blisters away from the pad seconds after the machine spins up. You pull the pad and run a thumb across the face. It’s not flat rubber anymore; it’s a patchwork of glazed islands and stringy adhesive, the aftermath of a too-hot removal. If you rely on psa sanding discs for flatness-critical work—whether it’s a disc grinder, DA sander, or a 20-inch platen—you know how fast one gummy pad can unravel an entire day’s finishing plan.</p><p class=post-card-meta>November 14, 2025 · 12 min read · by Mark Jensen</p></a></article><article class=post-card><a href=https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/clean-hook-and-loop-pads-to-extend-life-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/><div class=post-card-category>Hook-and-Loop Discs</div><h2 class=post-card-title>Clean Hook And Loop Pads To Extend Life</h2><p class=post-card-summary>Extend Life of Hook and Loop Sanding Discs and Pads Saturday morning in the shop: coffee on the bench, a fresh board clamped up, and the familiar hum of the random orbit sander. You press a new disc onto the pad, pull the trigger, and start your first pass—only to feel the disk skate and skip. You lift the sander and find a fuzz of dust caked onto the hooks, a few bent over, and that telltale glossy sheen that means friction has had its way with the pad. The job slows, the finish suffers, and those hook and loop sanding discs seem to be losing their grip long before the abrasive is worn out.</p><p class=post-card-meta>November 14, 2025 · 11 min read · by Emily Novak</p></a></article><article class=post-card><a href=https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts/><div class=post-card-category>Sanding Belts & Machines</div><h2 class=post-card-title>Avoid Burn Marks With Belt Sanders</h2><p class=post-card-summary>Stop Burn Marks: Master Belt Sanders & Sanding Belts You smell it before you see it—the faint sweet, acrid note that means heat has been winning. The shop is quiet except for the belt sander’s steady hum, dust hanging in the light like early fog. You’re two boards into a Saturday batch of maple shelves, and there it is: a brown kiss on the edge, curved perfectly to match your contact drum. It’s the same mark that has sent too many good pieces to the scrap bin. You lighten your touch, bump the feed, try another pass. The scorch grows one shade darker. If you’ve stood at a belt sander—handheld, benchtop, or wide-belt—you’ve had this moment. It’s not a lack of care. It’s heat, friction, and time teaming up faster than you can move.</p><p class=post-card-meta>November 14, 2025 · 12 min read · by Lucas Moreno</p></a></article><article class=post-card><a href=https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge/><div class=post-card-category>Sanding Sponges</div><h2 class=post-card-title>Scuff Sand Between Coats With A Sponge</h2><p class=post-card-summary>How to Scuff Sand Between Coats with a Sanding Sponge The first coat looked perfect under shop lights—glossy, mirror-like, promising. Then morning sunlight cut across the panel and told the truth: a few dust nibs, a faint orange peel near the edge, and the slightest ripple where the grain lifted. I’ve been there more times than I’ll admit. The urge is to lay on more finish and hope it “levels out,” but finishing rarely rewards wishful thinking.

The project might be a cabinet door with raised panels, an automotive quarter panel wearing its first coat of high-build, or a mid-century tabletop with a veneer you refuse to risk. Regardless of the substrate, the instrument in your hand—a sanding block—is the difference between flat and faceted, between crisp and crowned. When the pressure is wrong, the finish is wrong. The telltale symptoms appear later: telegraphed low spots under gloss, rounded edges where a sharp reveal should live, swirl hazing that refuses to die at the next grit.</p><p class=post-card-meta>November 13, 2025 · 13 min read · by Mark Jensen</p></a></article></div><nav class=pagination><a class=prev href=https://blog.equalle.com/page/3/>« Prev</a>

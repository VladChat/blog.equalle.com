&lt;p&gt;Saturday mornings in the shop start the same for me: kettle on, soft sun across the bench, and a project at that satisfying almost-there stage. I’d been chasing a glass-flat finish on a walnut desk with an epoxy river, and the last pass was fighting me—tiny swirls that only showed in raking light. I’d been sanding wet to keep dust down, but the paper kept going mushy at the edges. That’s when I swapped in film-backed silicon carbide sandpaper I’d stashed for auto body work. The difference was immediate: the sheet kept its shape, water beaded and carried the swarf away, and the scratch pattern evened out in a few clean passes. The surface went quiet—no chatter, just controlled cutting.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/10.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/instagram/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/instagram/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/instagram/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Edge Tool Blending With Main Field</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-tool-blending-with-main-field-concrete-polishing/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-tool-blending-with-main-field-concrete-polishing/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 15:29:17 +0000</pubDate><category>Stone &amp; Concrete Polishing</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Engineer-tested methods to blend edges with the main field in concrete polishing.

&lt;p&gt;You notice it first at the baseboards. Morning light lands across a kitchen floor that otherwise looks like poured glass, and the edges flash a dull, scratchy halo. In a boutique retail space, the center field mirrors the fixtures, but at the columns and along the walls, the reflection breaks—hazy, slightly orange-peeled, almost like it came from a different contractor. As a product engineer who reviews abrasives and machines for a living, I see this edge-to-field mismatch often, even on projects that nailed aggregate exposure and gloss in the main run. It’s not because teams don’t care; it’s because edge blending is where real-world constraints collide with the material science of concrete polishing: smaller tools, different pressure and speed, heat, slurry load, and changing paste content near walls.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/08.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-tool-blending-with-main-field-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/edge-tool-blending-with-main-field-concrete-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-tool-blending-with-main-field-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/edge-tool-blending-with-main-field-concrete-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-tool-blending-with-main-field-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/edge-tool-blending-with-main-field-concrete-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-tool-blending-with-main-field-concrete-polishing/cards/instagram/edge-tool-blending-with-main-field-concrete-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-tool-blending-with-main-field-concrete-polishing/cards/instagram/edge-tool-blending-with-main-field-concrete-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-tool-blending-with-main-field-concrete-polishing/cards/instagram/edge-tool-blending-with-main-field-concrete-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-tool-blending-with-main-field-concrete-polishing/cards/pinterest/edge-tool-blending-with-main-field-concrete-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-tool-blending-with-main-field-concrete-polishing/cards/pinterest/edge-tool-blending-with-main-field-concrete-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-tool-blending-with-main-field-concrete-polishing/cards/pinterest/edge-tool-blending-with-main-field-concrete-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-tool-blending-with-main-field-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/edge-tool-blending-with-main-field-concrete-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-tool-blending-with-main-field-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/edge-tool-blending-with-main-field-concrete-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-tool-blending-with-main-field-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/edge-tool-blending-with-main-field-concrete-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Edge Control Around Hardware And Seams</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 13:38:27 +0000</pubDate><category>Marine Sanding</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-280</category><category>grit-320</category><description>Advanced boat sanding techniques for edge control around hardware and seams, from abrasives and pads to workflows that protect profiles and finish quality.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="boat-sanding-mastery-edges-hardware-seams"&gt;Boat sanding mastery: edges, hardware, seams&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dock still smells of salt and diesel when you pull the cover back at first light. The hull prints the sunrise in dull reflections, beautiful from afar but cruel up close—pigtails, flat spots, and a halo of scuffs around the stanchion bases where an impatient hand once grazed the gelcoat. Today is about restraint as much as cutting power. Boat sanding isn’t hard in principle; it’s hard because boats are a collage of edges, radii, seams, and fasteners that punish every lapse in control. A random orbital can fair a panel in minutes, then choke at a cleat, overcut a toe rail, or trench a seam if you don’t recalibrate your technique and consumables for the geometry in front of you.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/06.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding/cards/instagram/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding/cards/instagram/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding/cards/instagram/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding/cards/pinterest/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding/cards/pinterest/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding/cards/pinterest/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Hone Ceramic Tile Edges Uniformly</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/18/hone-ceramic-tile-edges-uniformly-glass-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/18/hone-ceramic-tile-edges-uniformly-glass-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 18 Dec 2025 13:48:40 +0000</pubDate><category>Glass &amp; Ceramics Sanding</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-1500</category><description>with methods inspired by glass sanding.

&lt;p&gt;You notice it first with your fingertips. The bathroom is almost finished—the new vanity, the grout drying to a warm gray, the light bouncing off fresh ceramic. But as you reach to wipe away a stray haze line, a sharp corner catches your skin. It’s tiny, the sort of edge that doesn’t look like much, yet it steals the comfort from the space an inch at a time. Uniformly honed tile edges are what make a shower niche feel intentional, a kitchen backsplash look built-in rather than glued on. The margin between “nice” and “nailed it” often lives right there—at the line where glaze, clay, and air meet.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/04.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/18/hone-ceramic-tile-edges-uniformly-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/hone-ceramic-tile-edges-uniformly-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/18/hone-ceramic-tile-edges-uniformly-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/hone-ceramic-tile-edges-uniformly-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/18/hone-ceramic-tile-edges-uniformly-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/hone-ceramic-tile-edges-uniformly-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/18/hone-ceramic-tile-edges-uniformly-glass-sanding/cards/instagram/hone-ceramic-tile-edges-uniformly-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/18/hone-ceramic-tile-edges-uniformly-glass-sanding/cards/instagram/hone-ceramic-tile-edges-uniformly-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/18/hone-ceramic-tile-edges-uniformly-glass-sanding/cards/instagram/hone-ceramic-tile-edges-uniformly-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/18/hone-ceramic-tile-edges-uniformly-glass-sanding/cards/pinterest/hone-ceramic-tile-edges-uniformly-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/18/hone-ceramic-tile-edges-uniformly-glass-sanding/cards/pinterest/hone-ceramic-tile-edges-uniformly-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/18/hone-ceramic-tile-edges-uniformly-glass-sanding/cards/pinterest/hone-ceramic-tile-edges-uniformly-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/18/hone-ceramic-tile-edges-uniformly-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/hone-ceramic-tile-edges-uniformly-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/18/hone-ceramic-tile-edges-uniformly-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/hone-ceramic-tile-edges-uniformly-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/18/hone-ceramic-tile-edges-uniformly-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/hone-ceramic-tile-edges-uniformly-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Clean Pads To Prevent Micro Marring</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 17 Dec 2025 16:21:55 +0000</pubDate><category>Resin Polishing</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>clear coat</category><category>polishing pads</category><description>Stop swirls and haze.

&lt;p&gt;I’ve watched the same scene a hundred times: you finish a long day of shaping, sanding, and dialing in the gloss. The shop is quiet, the floor swept, your coffee cold. You swing the work light across the panel—maybe it’s a black hood, a river table, or a batch of resin bangles—and your stomach sinks. There it is: a faint gray haze of tiny trails that weren’t visible under the shop lights. That’s micro marring, and nine times out of ten it’s not your machine, polish, or even your technique—it’s what’s happening at the pad face. This is where cleaning while you work becomes the difference between “almost” and “absolutely flawless,” whether you’re finishing paint or doing resin polishing on jewelry and tabletops.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/02.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing/cards/instagram/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing/cards/instagram/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing/cards/instagram/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing/cards/pinterest/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing/cards/pinterest/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing/cards/pinterest/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Keep Heat Low To Prevent Softening</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 17 Dec 2025 14:27:08 +0000</pubDate><category>Plastic &amp; Epoxy Sanding</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>wet sanding</category><description>Engineer-tested guide to epoxy sanding without softening.

&lt;p&gt;The room is quiet except for the soft whirr of a 5-inch random orbital sander. You’ve invested hours pouring a resin river through a slab of maple, watched the swirl of pigment lock under crystal clarity, and now you’re finally leveling the surface for that glass-smooth finish. Then it happens—under the pad, the epoxy feels different. The sander drags, the dust turns to smeary ribbons, and the finish dulls into a gummy haze. If you’ve experienced that sinking feeling, you’ve already met the enemy of precision finishing: heat buildup.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/29.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding/cards/instagram/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding/cards/instagram/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding/cards/instagram/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding/cards/pinterest/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding/cards/pinterest/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding/cards/pinterest/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Reduce Polishing Time With Fine Films</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 17 Dec 2025 13:38:35 +0000</pubDate><category>Specialty Abrasives</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-1200</category><category>grit-2000</category><description>Cut polishing time with microfinishing film.

&lt;p&gt;A Sunday evening shop quiets in that special way it does when the last coat finally flashes off. The blade you’ve ground all afternoon catches a line of light on the bench—almost there, but not quite. The scratch from the coarse stage is still telegraphing through, a shallow arc that you can feel more than see. You have two choices: keep chasing it with the same field-worn abrasive, or change the game. This is where microfinishing film earns its keep. With a stable, flat backing and precisely graded minerals, you can push the finish forward predictably instead of gambling time on inconsistent paper or tired belts. That predictability is what shaves hours, not minutes, from a polishing day.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/27.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film/cards/facebook/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film/cards/facebook/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film/cards/facebook/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film/cards/instagram/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film/cards/instagram/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film/cards/instagram/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film/cards/pinterest/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film/cards/pinterest/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film/cards/pinterest/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film/cards/facebook/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film/cards/facebook/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film/cards/facebook/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Avoid Edge Burn Through While Wet Sanding</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/16/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/16/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 14:26:25 +0000</pubDate><category>Waterproof &amp; Wet/Dry Paper</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>clear coat</category><category>mirror finish</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>sanding block</category><description>Learn how to avoid edge burn-through while wet sanding using wet dry sandpaper, smart pressure control, and safe techniques around panels and body lines.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="avoid-edge-burn-through-with-wet-dry-sandpaper"&gt;Avoid Edge Burn-Through with Wet Dry Sandpaper&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday light pools across the driveway. Your project—clear coat mottled with orange peel and a few dust nibs—waits patiently. You’ve gathered your bucket, a soft block, and a stack of wet dry sandpaper sheets, promising yourself you’ll go slow and do it right this time. The first passes are almost meditative: water beads, slurry darkens, and the surface gradually evens out. Then, edging along a fender crease, your heart stutters—you feel it grab. One careless swipe, one ounce too much pressure, and suddenly the gloss gives way to dull haze. You squeegee and look closer. A whisper of primer peeks through at the ridge.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/25.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/16/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/16/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/16/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/16/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/instagram/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/16/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/instagram/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/16/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/instagram/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/16/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/16/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/16/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/16/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/16/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/16/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Pressure And Speed Settings For Ceramics</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/16/pressure-and-speed-settings-for-ceramics-ceramic-sanding-discs/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/16/pressure-and-speed-settings-for-ceramics-ceramic-sanding-discs/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 13:44:59 +0000</pubDate><category>Ceramic &amp; Premium Abrasives</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-320</category><category>dust control</category><category>wet sanding</category><description>Learn pro-level pressure and speed settings for ceramics using ceramic sanding discs, with step-by-step methods, tips, and troubleshooting.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="ceramic-sanding-discs-pressure-and-speed-guide"&gt;Ceramic Sanding Discs: Pressure and Speed Guide&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Late Saturday, the shop was warm and humming when a customer walked in with a chipped porcelain threshold. “One wrong pass,” he sighed, pointing at the glossy edge that now had a small bite missing. I recognized it immediately: too much speed, too much pressure, and a disc that glazed over before it could cut clean. I’ve been there—on driftwood, on aluminum, and yes, on ceramic tile where heat and hard grains make every mistake loud and permanent. That’s why pressure and speed matter more with ceramics than almost any other material. Ceramic is unforgiving. The wrong setting with ceramic sanding discs can burnish instead of cut, spike temperatures, and cause micro-cracking or edge blowouts you won’t see until the grout goes in.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/23.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/16/pressure-and-speed-settings-for-ceramics-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/pressure-and-speed-settings-for-ceramics-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/16/pressure-and-speed-settings-for-ceramics-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/pressure-and-speed-settings-for-ceramics-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/16/pressure-and-speed-settings-for-ceramics-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/pressure-and-speed-settings-for-ceramics-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/16/pressure-and-speed-settings-for-ceramics-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/pressure-and-speed-settings-for-ceramics-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/16/pressure-and-speed-settings-for-ceramics-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/pressure-and-speed-settings-for-ceramics-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/16/pressure-and-speed-settings-for-ceramics-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/pressure-and-speed-settings-for-ceramics-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/16/pressure-and-speed-settings-for-ceramics-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/pressure-and-speed-settings-for-ceramics-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/16/pressure-and-speed-settings-for-ceramics-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/pressure-and-speed-settings-for-ceramics-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/16/pressure-and-speed-settings-for-ceramics-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/pressure-and-speed-settings-for-ceramics-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/16/pressure-and-speed-settings-for-ceramics-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/pressure-and-speed-settings-for-ceramics-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/16/pressure-and-speed-settings-for-ceramics-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/pressure-and-speed-settings-for-ceramics-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/16/pressure-and-speed-settings-for-ceramics-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/pressure-and-speed-settings-for-ceramics-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>When To Drop Back A Grit To Fix Defects</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/15/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/15/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 15 Dec 2025 13:46:21 +0000</pubDate><category>Grit Range &amp; Classification</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><description>Practical rules and tests to know when to drop back sandpaper grit to remove defects without over-sanding, from wood and resin to automotive clear coat.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="when-to-drop-back-sandpaper-grit-to-fix-defects"&gt;When to Drop Back Sandpaper Grit to Fix Defects&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning. Coffee cooling on the bench, raking light cutting across your project like a truth serum. You wanted a quick scuff-and-recoat—thirty minutes, tops. Instead, the panel keeps whispering back at you: that line near the edge, the mysterious dull patch that won’t clear, the faint spiral that appears only at a certain angle. You switch sheets, then pressure, then motion, but the micro-scratches stubbornly telegraph through. It’s the universal moment where your patience meets physics: do you keep climbing up the sequence or drop back a sandpaper grit to reset the scratch pattern?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/21.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/15/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/15/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/15/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/15/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit/cards/instagram/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/15/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit/cards/instagram/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/15/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit/cards/instagram/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/15/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit/cards/pinterest/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/15/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit/cards/pinterest/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/15/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit/cards/pinterest/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/15/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/15/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/15/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Final Grit Selection By Finish Type</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/14/final-grit-selection-by-finish-type-sandpaper-grit-chart/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/14/final-grit-selection-by-finish-type-sandpaper-grit-chart/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 14 Dec 2025 13:33:32 +0000</pubDate><category>Grit Guide &amp; Education</category><category>grit chart</category><category>abrasive standards</category><category>grit progression</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-101</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><description>Clear, expert guidance on final grit selection by finish type.

&lt;p&gt;It’s 8:40 p.m. in a quiet shop, and the last pass of the sander will decide everything. The walnut dresser is leveled, drawer faces are flush, and you’ve already tuned the edges by hand. What remains is the final grit choice—the one that determines whether an oil finish glows with depth, a waterborne polyurethane keys properly, or a lacquer topcoat lays down glass-flat. This is where a sandpaper grit chart becomes more than a table of numbers; it’s a translation key between surface profile, abrasive behavior, and finish chemistry. Choose carelessly and you’ll fight adhesion problems, washed-out figure, or telegraphed swirl marks. Choose well and the finish rewards you with clarity, durability, and speed.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/19.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/14/final-grit-selection-by-finish-type-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/final-grit-selection-by-finish-type-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/14/final-grit-selection-by-finish-type-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/final-grit-selection-by-finish-type-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/14/final-grit-selection-by-finish-type-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/final-grit-selection-by-finish-type-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/14/final-grit-selection-by-finish-type-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/instagram/final-grit-selection-by-finish-type-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/14/final-grit-selection-by-finish-type-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/instagram/final-grit-selection-by-finish-type-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/14/final-grit-selection-by-finish-type-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/instagram/final-grit-selection-by-finish-type-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/14/final-grit-selection-by-finish-type-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/pinterest/final-grit-selection-by-finish-type-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/14/final-grit-selection-by-finish-type-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/pinterest/final-grit-selection-by-finish-type-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/14/final-grit-selection-by-finish-type-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/pinterest/final-grit-selection-by-finish-type-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/14/final-grit-selection-by-finish-type-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/final-grit-selection-by-finish-type-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/14/final-grit-selection-by-finish-type-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/final-grit-selection-by-finish-type-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/14/final-grit-selection-by-finish-type-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/final-grit-selection-by-finish-type-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Use Bag Plus Hepa Filter For Drywall Dust</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/13/use-bag-plus-hepa-filter-for-drywall-dust-dustless-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/13/use-bag-plus-hepa-filter-for-drywall-dust-dustless-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 13 Dec 2025 13:32:51 +0000</pubDate><category>Dust Extraction Systems</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-320</category><description>Learn how to pair a HEPA bag and filter for dustless sanding, keeping drywall dust under control with cleaner air, faster cleanup, and pro-grade results.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="dustless-sanding-with-hepa-bags-for-drywall-dust"&gt;Dustless sanding with HEPA bags for drywall dust&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first time you sand fresh drywall, you learn how sneaky the dust can be. It drifts like fog—settling in coffee cups, clinging to jackets by the door, finding its way into rooms you never even entered. A weekend project becomes a week of wiping, vacuuming, and still catching a powdery haze in the afternoon sun. If you’re living in the space you’re renovating, the frustration is double: family life doesn’t pause while you sand. That’s why the right setup—pairing a vacuum bag with a true HEPA filter and a sander built for dustless sanding—changes everything. It’s not just cleaner; it’s calmer. You notice the shift the first time you turn off the sander and the air looks the same as it did before you started.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/17.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/13/use-bag-plus-hepa-filter-for-drywall-dust-dustless-sanding/cards/facebook/use-bag-plus-hepa-filter-for-drywall-dust-dustless-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/13/use-bag-plus-hepa-filter-for-drywall-dust-dustless-sanding/cards/facebook/use-bag-plus-hepa-filter-for-drywall-dust-dustless-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/13/use-bag-plus-hepa-filter-for-drywall-dust-dustless-sanding/cards/facebook/use-bag-plus-hepa-filter-for-drywall-dust-dustless-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/13/use-bag-plus-hepa-filter-for-drywall-dust-dustless-sanding/cards/instagram/use-bag-plus-hepa-filter-for-drywall-dust-dustless-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/13/use-bag-plus-hepa-filter-for-drywall-dust-dustless-sanding/cards/instagram/use-bag-plus-hepa-filter-for-drywall-dust-dustless-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/13/use-bag-plus-hepa-filter-for-drywall-dust-dustless-sanding/cards/instagram/use-bag-plus-hepa-filter-for-drywall-dust-dustless-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/13/use-bag-plus-hepa-filter-for-drywall-dust-dustless-sanding/cards/pinterest/use-bag-plus-hepa-filter-for-drywall-dust-dustless-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/13/use-bag-plus-hepa-filter-for-drywall-dust-dustless-sanding/cards/pinterest/use-bag-plus-hepa-filter-for-drywall-dust-dustless-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/13/use-bag-plus-hepa-filter-for-drywall-dust-dustless-sanding/cards/pinterest/use-bag-plus-hepa-filter-for-drywall-dust-dustless-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/13/use-bag-plus-hepa-filter-for-drywall-dust-dustless-sanding/cards/facebook/use-bag-plus-hepa-filter-for-drywall-dust-dustless-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/13/use-bag-plus-hepa-filter-for-drywall-dust-dustless-sanding/cards/facebook/use-bag-plus-hepa-filter-for-drywall-dust-dustless-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/13/use-bag-plus-hepa-filter-for-drywall-dust-dustless-sanding/cards/facebook/use-bag-plus-hepa-filter-for-drywall-dust-dustless-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Multi Density Pad Stacks For Tricky Shapes</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/multi-density-pad-stacks-for-tricky-shapes-sander-interface-pad/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/multi-density-pad-stacks-for-tricky-shapes-sander-interface-pad/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 12 Dec 2025 16:15:21 +0000</pubDate><category>Interface Pads &amp; Backing Pads</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>orbital sander</category><description>Learn how to build multi-density sander interface pad stacks for tricky shapes, with step-by-step setups, pro tips, and real-world sanding techniques.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="multi-density-sander-interface-pad-stacks-for-curves"&gt;Multi-Density Sander Interface Pad Stacks for Curves&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first time you chase a graceful curve with a flat sanding disc, you feel it: that tiny chatter, the scratch that won’t blend out, the edge that suddenly burns through. It’s a lesson every builder learns, whether you’re shaping a guitar heel, blending autobody filler into a wheel arch, or easing a bullnose on oak treads. In my shop, those moments used to slow projects to a crawl—especially when my random orbital insisted on flattening what I needed to caress. Then I started stacking foam like a chef layers flavors: soft for drape, medium for control, thin for crispness. That stack, centered on a sander interface pad, turned my sander into a shape-following tool instead of a shape-fighting one.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/15.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/multi-density-pad-stacks-for-tricky-shapes-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/multi-density-pad-stacks-for-tricky-shapes-sander-interface-pad.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/multi-density-pad-stacks-for-tricky-shapes-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/multi-density-pad-stacks-for-tricky-shapes-sander-interface-pad.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/multi-density-pad-stacks-for-tricky-shapes-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/multi-density-pad-stacks-for-tricky-shapes-sander-interface-pad.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/multi-density-pad-stacks-for-tricky-shapes-sander-interface-pad/cards/instagram/multi-density-pad-stacks-for-tricky-shapes-sander-interface-pad.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/multi-density-pad-stacks-for-tricky-shapes-sander-interface-pad/cards/instagram/multi-density-pad-stacks-for-tricky-shapes-sander-interface-pad.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/multi-density-pad-stacks-for-tricky-shapes-sander-interface-pad/cards/instagram/multi-density-pad-stacks-for-tricky-shapes-sander-interface-pad.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/multi-density-pad-stacks-for-tricky-shapes-sander-interface-pad/cards/pinterest/multi-density-pad-stacks-for-tricky-shapes-sander-interface-pad.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/multi-density-pad-stacks-for-tricky-shapes-sander-interface-pad/cards/pinterest/multi-density-pad-stacks-for-tricky-shapes-sander-interface-pad.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/multi-density-pad-stacks-for-tricky-shapes-sander-interface-pad/cards/pinterest/multi-density-pad-stacks-for-tricky-shapes-sander-interface-pad.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/multi-density-pad-stacks-for-tricky-shapes-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/multi-density-pad-stacks-for-tricky-shapes-sander-interface-pad.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/multi-density-pad-stacks-for-tricky-shapes-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/multi-density-pad-stacks-for-tricky-shapes-sander-interface-pad.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/multi-density-pad-stacks-for-tricky-shapes-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/multi-density-pad-stacks-for-tricky-shapes-sander-interface-pad.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Best Grits For Leveling Primer</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 12 Dec 2025 14:45:24 +0000</pubDate><category>PSA Discs</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-500</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>clear coat</category><category>wet sanding</category><description>Engineer-tested guide to the best grits for leveling primer.

&lt;p&gt;Saturday mornings in my garage start with coffee, a quiet radio, and a panel that still holds a map of yesterday’s imperfections. The primer is flat gray, but under a raking light you can read it like topography—little ridges around a dent repair, faint peel from a heavy pass, and that one shallow wave you only see when you step back. I’ve learned that this is where the paint job is actually won or lost, not in the clear coat. And the tools matter: the block, the sander orbit, the mineral in the abrasive, even the adhesive that bonds the disc. When I swapped to psa sanding discs on a rigid interface for the first “leveling” cut, I noticed two things right away—straighter panels and fewer surprises after sealer.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/13.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Avoid Edge Lift At High Rpm</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/avoid-edge-lift-at-high-rpm-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/avoid-edge-lift-at-high-rpm-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 12 Dec 2025 13:40:36 +0000</pubDate><category>Hook-and-Loop Discs</category><category>grit-150</category><description>Prevent edge lift at high RPM with hook and loop sanding discs—optimize pads, pressure, heat, and workflow for flawless surface preparation.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="stop-edge-lift-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs-at-rpm"&gt;Stop Edge Lift: Hook and Loop Sanding Discs at RPM&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first time I heard the flit of a disc edge slapping a workpiece at full speed, I knew the surface was lost. The panel had been blocked flat, the vacuum switched on, and the sander wound up to max. Ten seconds later, the perimeter of the abrasive began to chatter. The hook field ran hot, the outer 5 mm lifted, and a spiral scar traced the grain like a tattoo I didn’t order. If you’ve ever watched your finish window close in a heartbeat, you know the feeling—time and material slipping away because the disc couldn’t hold together at speed.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/11.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/avoid-edge-lift-at-high-rpm-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/avoid-edge-lift-at-high-rpm-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/avoid-edge-lift-at-high-rpm-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/avoid-edge-lift-at-high-rpm-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/avoid-edge-lift-at-high-rpm-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/avoid-edge-lift-at-high-rpm-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/avoid-edge-lift-at-high-rpm-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/avoid-edge-lift-at-high-rpm-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/avoid-edge-lift-at-high-rpm-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/avoid-edge-lift-at-high-rpm-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/avoid-edge-lift-at-high-rpm-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/avoid-edge-lift-at-high-rpm-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/avoid-edge-lift-at-high-rpm-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/avoid-edge-lift-at-high-rpm-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/avoid-edge-lift-at-high-rpm-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/avoid-edge-lift-at-high-rpm-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/avoid-edge-lift-at-high-rpm-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/avoid-edge-lift-at-high-rpm-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/avoid-edge-lift-at-high-rpm-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/avoid-edge-lift-at-high-rpm-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/avoid-edge-lift-at-high-rpm-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/avoid-edge-lift-at-high-rpm-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/avoid-edge-lift-at-high-rpm-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/avoid-edge-lift-at-high-rpm-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Select Correct Belt Width For Task</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/select-correct-belt-width-for-task-sanding-belts/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/select-correct-belt-width-for-task-sanding-belts/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 11 Dec 2025 15:16:44 +0000</pubDate><category>Sanding Belts &amp; Machines</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-280</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Learn how to choose the correct sanding belt width for any task, with clear sizing steps, grit pairing advice, setup tips, and safety pointers.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="choosing-the-right-width-for-sanding-belts"&gt;Choosing the Right Width for Sanding Belts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a quiet Saturday morning, you dust off the benchtop sander you’ve had for years. The shop light warms your worktable as you reach for a fresh belt, determined to smooth a wobbly chair you promised to restore. Coffee steams nearby, the radio hums, and for a few minutes it feels like everything slows down. Then, a familiar frustration: chatter marks across the rail. You steady your hands, check alignment, slow your feed—and still the surface doesn’t level cleanly. It’s not your skill. It’s not the grit. It’s the width. This is where many makers and mechanics unknowingly lose time and precision: selecting the wrong width of sanding belts for the job.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/09.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/select-correct-belt-width-for-task-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/select-correct-belt-width-for-task-sanding-belts.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/select-correct-belt-width-for-task-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/select-correct-belt-width-for-task-sanding-belts.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/select-correct-belt-width-for-task-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/select-correct-belt-width-for-task-sanding-belts.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/select-correct-belt-width-for-task-sanding-belts/cards/instagram/select-correct-belt-width-for-task-sanding-belts.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/select-correct-belt-width-for-task-sanding-belts/cards/instagram/select-correct-belt-width-for-task-sanding-belts.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/select-correct-belt-width-for-task-sanding-belts/cards/instagram/select-correct-belt-width-for-task-sanding-belts.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/select-correct-belt-width-for-task-sanding-belts/cards/pinterest/select-correct-belt-width-for-task-sanding-belts.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/select-correct-belt-width-for-task-sanding-belts/cards/pinterest/select-correct-belt-width-for-task-sanding-belts.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/select-correct-belt-width-for-task-sanding-belts/cards/pinterest/select-correct-belt-width-for-task-sanding-belts.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/select-correct-belt-width-for-task-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/select-correct-belt-width-for-task-sanding-belts.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/select-correct-belt-width-for-task-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/select-correct-belt-width-for-task-sanding-belts.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/select-correct-belt-width-for-task-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/select-correct-belt-width-for-task-sanding-belts.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Denibbing With Ultra Fine Sponge Abrasives</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 11 Dec 2025 14:14:40 +0000</pubDate><category>Sanding Sponges</category><category>grit-280</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>mirror finish</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>dry sanding</category><category>clear coat</category><category>dust control</category><description>Learn denibbing with ultra fine sponge abrasives.

&lt;p&gt;The shop was quiet except for the gentle hum of the dust extractor and the tick of cooling lights. I’d just laid the final coat on a black cabinet door—high-gloss lacquer, deep and mirror-like. It looked perfect under the booth lamps… until I rolled it into raking light. There they were: tiny raised specks scattered like stars—dust nibs. No drama, no panic. I’ve been here before. This is where an ultra fine sanding sponge earns its keep. It doesn’t scream for attention like a sander or a buffer; it just quietly, precisely knocks down the dots that ruin a perfect finish.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/07.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge/cards/instagram/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge/cards/instagram/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge/cards/instagram/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge/cards/pinterest/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge/cards/pinterest/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge/cards/pinterest/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Sand Edges Straight With Block Control</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 11 Dec 2025 13:45:02 +0000</pubDate><category>Sanding Blocks</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-280</category><category>sanding block</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Engineer-tested methods to sand edges straight with block control—covering block materials, grits, pressure, and measurement for crisp, furniture-grade results.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="straight-edges-with-a-sanding-block-engineers-guide"&gt;Straight Edges with a Sanding Block: Engineer’s Guide&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a quiet satisfaction when a board’s edge goes from ragged to crisp under your fingertips. You sight down the length, catch a glint of shop light, and see a clean, uninterrupted line—no ripples, no dips, no proud corners snagging a cloth. That straightness is the difference between a door that closes like a whisper and one that bites the jamb. It’s the moment where craft meets physics, and for me—an engineer who lives for process—the right tool is what makes that moment repeatable. For edge work, that tool is a sanding block.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/05.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block/cards/facebook/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block/cards/facebook/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block/cards/facebook/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block/cards/instagram/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block/cards/instagram/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block/cards/instagram/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block/cards/facebook/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block/cards/facebook/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block/cards/facebook/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Use Light Pressure To Prevent Gouging</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/use-light-pressure-to-prevent-gouging-detail-sander-sheets/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/use-light-pressure-to-prevent-gouging-detail-sander-sheets/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 10 Dec 2025 16:10:27 +0000</pubDate><category>Detail Sander Sheets</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-280</category><category>grit progression</category><category>sanding block</category><description>Learn why light pressure prevents gouging and how to choose and use detail sander sheets for cleaner surfaces, longer abrasive life, and consistent finishes.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="why-detail-sander-sheets-require-a-light-touch"&gt;Why Detail Sander Sheets Require a Light Touch&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It starts with a hum—the compact orbit of a delta-pad gliding toward a tight inside corner where a cabinet door stile meets the rail. The walnut is older than your clamps, with grain that doesn’t forgive. You’ve prepped the shop, dialed down the RPM, and set up extraction, but your fingers still tense as you aim the tip into a fillet. Press too hard, and you’ll carve a shallow dish that daylight will announce the moment a finish hits. If you’ve ever found yourself polishing out a crater that appears only under raking light, you know the culprit: load. The solution isn’t exotic; it’s discipline. Use light pressure to prevent gouging—especially when your abrasive is fresh and your tool is nimble. That’s where the right detail sander sheets make or break the outcome.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/03.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/use-light-pressure-to-prevent-gouging-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/use-light-pressure-to-prevent-gouging-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/use-light-pressure-to-prevent-gouging-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/use-light-pressure-to-prevent-gouging-detail-sander-sheets.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/use-light-pressure-to-prevent-gouging-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/use-light-pressure-to-prevent-gouging-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/use-light-pressure-to-prevent-gouging-detail-sander-sheets/cards/instagram/use-light-pressure-to-prevent-gouging-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/use-light-pressure-to-prevent-gouging-detail-sander-sheets/cards/instagram/use-light-pressure-to-prevent-gouging-detail-sander-sheets.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/use-light-pressure-to-prevent-gouging-detail-sander-sheets/cards/instagram/use-light-pressure-to-prevent-gouging-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/use-light-pressure-to-prevent-gouging-detail-sander-sheets/cards/pinterest/use-light-pressure-to-prevent-gouging-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/use-light-pressure-to-prevent-gouging-detail-sander-sheets/cards/pinterest/use-light-pressure-to-prevent-gouging-detail-sander-sheets.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/use-light-pressure-to-prevent-gouging-detail-sander-sheets/cards/pinterest/use-light-pressure-to-prevent-gouging-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/use-light-pressure-to-prevent-gouging-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/use-light-pressure-to-prevent-gouging-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/use-light-pressure-to-prevent-gouging-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/use-light-pressure-to-prevent-gouging-detail-sander-sheets.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/use-light-pressure-to-prevent-gouging-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/use-light-pressure-to-prevent-gouging-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Vacuum Hookup For Dustless Orbital Sanding</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/vacuum-hookup-for-dustless-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/vacuum-hookup-for-dustless-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 10 Dec 2025 15:13:40 +0000</pubDate><category>Random Orbital Sanding</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>dust control</category><category>orbital sander</category><description>Achieve dustless results with smart vacuum hookups for random orbital sanding.

&lt;p&gt;The first time you see true “dustless” sanding, it feels like cheating. The room stays clear, your lungs don’t protest, and the surface looks better with each pass. I remember a Saturday morning in a small basement shop—coffee steaming, maple table top ready, and my playlist queued up—when a familiar dread crept in. I loved building things, but I hated the blizzard of dust that came with it. It wove into sweaters, clung to eyelashes, and added an hour of cleanup to every project. That day, I swapped my old hose for a snug-fitting antistatic one, dialed the vacuum to the sweet spot, and tried random orbital sanding with the vac hooked up. Ten minutes later, I realized I was breathing easier. The snowstorm never came.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/01.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/vacuum-hookup-for-dustless-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/vacuum-hookup-for-dustless-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/vacuum-hookup-for-dustless-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/vacuum-hookup-for-dustless-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/vacuum-hookup-for-dustless-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/vacuum-hookup-for-dustless-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/vacuum-hookup-for-dustless-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/instagram/vacuum-hookup-for-dustless-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/vacuum-hookup-for-dustless-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/instagram/vacuum-hookup-for-dustless-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/vacuum-hookup-for-dustless-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/instagram/vacuum-hookup-for-dustless-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/vacuum-hookup-for-dustless-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/pinterest/vacuum-hookup-for-dustless-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/vacuum-hookup-for-dustless-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/pinterest/vacuum-hookup-for-dustless-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/vacuum-hookup-for-dustless-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/pinterest/vacuum-hookup-for-dustless-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/vacuum-hookup-for-dustless-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/vacuum-hookup-for-dustless-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/vacuum-hookup-for-dustless-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/vacuum-hookup-for-dustless-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/vacuum-hookup-for-dustless-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/vacuum-hookup-for-dustless-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Finish Out Micro Marring And Haze</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 10 Dec 2025 13:42:22 +0000</pubDate><category>Polishing &amp; Finishing</category><category>mirror finish</category><category>polishing pads</category><category>grit progression</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>clear coat</category><description>Learn how to finish out micro marring and haze using polishing sandpaper, pads, and polish.

&lt;p&gt;It’s 9 p.m., the shop lights are humming, and the panel you’ve been nursing all day looks perfect—until you hit it with a tight, cool LED beam. There it is: a faint cloudy halo that follows the light like a shadow. Micro marring. Haze. It doesn’t ruin a job, but it steals the depth that makes a finish sing. I’ve seen it a thousand times—after wet sanding runs, after cutting with a heavy compound, even after a rushed “final” pass. The good news is you can bring the gloss back. You just need the right sequence, the right pressure, and (yes) the right polishing sandpaper so every step sets up the next.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/28.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper/cards/instagram/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper/cards/instagram/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper/cards/instagram/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Tack Cloth And Vacuum Steps After Scuff Sanding</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 17:33:26 +0000</pubDate><category>Between-Coats Sanding</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>dust control</category><category>clear coat</category><description>Engineer-tested steps for between coats sanding: how to vacuum, tack, and scuff for flawless finishes without dust nibs or witness lines.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="between-coats-sanding-with-tack-cloth-and-vacuum"&gt;Between Coats Sanding with Tack Cloth and Vacuum&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first time I cared about finish quality was on a cold Saturday, kneeling on a drop cloth, cradling a cabinet door that looked perfect—until light from the window slid across it. That raking beam turned gentle amber into a topography of dust nibs, witness lines, and a faint, scratchy haze. I’d rushed the cleaning between scuff passes and relied on a single wipe with an old T‑shirt. The result was predictable in hindsight: dust trapped in clear coat, uneven adhesion, and a finish that only looked good under dim light. That afternoon I learned what every disciplined finisher knows: between coats sanding isn’t about aggression—it’s about control.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/26.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding/cards/instagram/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding/cards/instagram/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding/cards/instagram/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding/cards/pinterest/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding/cards/pinterest/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding/cards/pinterest/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Epa Rrp Containment Setup For Lead Paint Sanding</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 15:44:17 +0000</pubDate><category>Paint Removal &amp; Surface Prep</category><category>paint prep</category><category>rust removal</category><category>primer coat</category><category>sanding block</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><description>A technical guide to EPA RRP containment for lead-safe sanding, covering surface prep, abrasive selection, HEPA capture, and low-dust workflows.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="epa-rrp-containment-for-lead-safe-sanding"&gt;EPA RRP Containment for Lead-Safe Sanding&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a moment, right before the sander touches the surface, when a room holds its breath. You’ve taped the vents, rolled up area rugs, shuffled furniture to the hallway. In an older home—maybe one built just after the war, with trim thick enough to show paint strata like tree rings—you feel the weight of history in the baseboards and widow’s walk. You also feel responsibility. Dust is memory made airborne, and when that dust contains lead, it crosses the boundary from nuisance to long-term health hazard in seconds. The job becomes less about “cleaning up later” and more about “controlling everything now.” That’s precisely where epa rrp containment setup lives, and it’s the fulcrum between craftsmanship and care.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/24.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding/cards/facebook/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding/cards/facebook/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding/cards/facebook/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding/cards/instagram/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding/cards/instagram/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding/cards/instagram/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding/cards/pinterest/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding/cards/pinterest/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding/cards/pinterest/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding/cards/facebook/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding/cards/facebook/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding/cards/facebook/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Grind Out Rust And Feather Edges For Patch Repair</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 14:44:40 +0000</pubDate><category>Metal Polishing &amp; Rust Repair</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>rust removal</category><description>Learn rust repair the right way: grind out corrosion, feather paint edges, and patch cleanly for durable, near-invisible automotive fixes.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="rust-repair-101-grind-feather-and-patch-like-pro"&gt;Rust Repair 101: Grind, Feather, and Patch Like Pro&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The moment you notice it is rarely dramatic. Maybe you’re pouring your first cup of coffee, the driveway still cool in the morning shade, when a small bubble on the wheel arch catches your eye. It wasn’t there last summer. You press lightly; the paint flexes and flattens like a blister. It’s a tiny flaw, easy to ignore while the engine warms and the day rushes in. But you know how rust works. It doesn’t wait. It keeps chewing, one quiet day after another, under glossy paint where you can’t see it.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/22.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair/cards/facebook/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair/cards/facebook/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair/cards/facebook/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair/cards/instagram/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair/cards/instagram/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair/cards/instagram/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair/cards/pinterest/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair/cards/pinterest/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair/cards/pinterest/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair/cards/facebook/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair/cards/facebook/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair/cards/facebook/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Identify Hard Factory Coating Versus Simple Surface Oxidation</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 13:41:15 +0000</pubDate><category>Headlight Restoration</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>clear coat</category><description>Learn to spot hard factory coatings vs. simple oxidation on plastics, then restore safely with step-by-step sanding, polishing, and protection.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="plastic-oxidation-removal-coating-vs-surface-oxide"&gt;Plastic Oxidation Removal: Coating vs. Surface Oxide&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning in the shop, coffee ring on the bench, you wipe a thumb across a chalky ATV fender and it ghosts your finger white. Ten feet away, the headlight lens on your daily driver looks foggy and amber; a quick pass with glass cleaner does nothing. On a trailer, the kayak’s once-deep orange now reads as flat and pinkish. If you’ve been hunting for plastic oxidation removal tips, you’re halfway there—but here’s the catch: not all dull plastic is just oxidation. Sometimes you’re seeing degradation of a hard factory coating, and sometimes it’s a thin film of chalk oxidized from the base material itself. Treat them the same and you’ll either stop too early—leaving haze—or go too far—burning through a protective layer you actually needed.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/20.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation/cards/facebook/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation/cards/facebook/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation/cards/facebook/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation/cards/instagram/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation/cards/instagram/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation/cards/instagram/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation/cards/pinterest/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation/cards/pinterest/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation/cards/pinterest/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation/cards/facebook/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation/cards/facebook/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation/cards/facebook/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>When To Choose 2000 Versus 3000 Grit For Clear Refining</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/when-to-choose-2000-versus-3000-grit-for-clear-refining-2000-3000-grit-wet-sandi/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/when-to-choose-2000-versus-3000-grit-for-clear-refining-2000-3000-grit-wet-sandi/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2025 14:35:11 +0000</pubDate><category>Wet Sanding Clear Coat</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>clear coat</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>Engineer’s guide to choosing 2000 vs 3000 grit for wet sanding clear.

&lt;p&gt;On a clear autumn morning I watched a black coupe roll into our test bay, its hood shimmering in early light—beautiful from five meters, troubling at fifty centimeters. The owner had tried to fix a few nibs and orange peel with a single pass of 3000 grit, then compounded. The result was a glossy mirror with a faint gray cast in the sun and a couple of nibs still telegraphing through. I’ve seen the inverse too: a shop tech leveling clear with 2000, only to chase out deep sanding marks all afternoon because the paint had cured hard and the compound wasn’t cutting efficiently. Both scenarios point to the same decision inflection: picking the right end of the 2000–3000 grit wet sanding range for clear refining.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/18.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/when-to-choose-2000-versus-3000-grit-for-clear-refining-2000-3000-grit-wet-sandi/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-2000-versus-3000-grit-for-clear-refining-2000-3000-grit-wet-sandi.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/when-to-choose-2000-versus-3000-grit-for-clear-refining-2000-3000-grit-wet-sandi/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-2000-versus-3000-grit-for-clear-refining-2000-3000-grit-wet-sandi.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/when-to-choose-2000-versus-3000-grit-for-clear-refining-2000-3000-grit-wet-sandi/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-2000-versus-3000-grit-for-clear-refining-2000-3000-grit-wet-sandi.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/when-to-choose-2000-versus-3000-grit-for-clear-refining-2000-3000-grit-wet-sandi/cards/instagram/when-to-choose-2000-versus-3000-grit-for-clear-refining-2000-3000-grit-wet-sandi.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/when-to-choose-2000-versus-3000-grit-for-clear-refining-2000-3000-grit-wet-sandi/cards/instagram/when-to-choose-2000-versus-3000-grit-for-clear-refining-2000-3000-grit-wet-sandi.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/when-to-choose-2000-versus-3000-grit-for-clear-refining-2000-3000-grit-wet-sandi/cards/instagram/when-to-choose-2000-versus-3000-grit-for-clear-refining-2000-3000-grit-wet-sandi.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/when-to-choose-2000-versus-3000-grit-for-clear-refining-2000-3000-grit-wet-sandi/cards/pinterest/when-to-choose-2000-versus-3000-grit-for-clear-refining-2000-3000-grit-wet-sandi.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/when-to-choose-2000-versus-3000-grit-for-clear-refining-2000-3000-grit-wet-sandi/cards/pinterest/when-to-choose-2000-versus-3000-grit-for-clear-refining-2000-3000-grit-wet-sandi.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/when-to-choose-2000-versus-3000-grit-for-clear-refining-2000-3000-grit-wet-sandi/cards/pinterest/when-to-choose-2000-versus-3000-grit-for-clear-refining-2000-3000-grit-wet-sandi.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/when-to-choose-2000-versus-3000-grit-for-clear-refining-2000-3000-grit-wet-sandi/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-2000-versus-3000-grit-for-clear-refining-2000-3000-grit-wet-sandi.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/when-to-choose-2000-versus-3000-grit-for-clear-refining-2000-3000-grit-wet-sandi/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-2000-versus-3000-grit-for-clear-refining-2000-3000-grit-wet-sandi.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/when-to-choose-2000-versus-3000-grit-for-clear-refining-2000-3000-grit-wet-sandi/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-2000-versus-3000-grit-for-clear-refining-2000-3000-grit-wet-sandi.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Apply Dry Guide Coat Evenly Over Primer Before Blocking</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2025 13:40:28 +0000</pubDate><category>Auto Body Sanding</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-500</category><category>grit-600</category><category>dust control</category><description>Learn how to apply a dry guide coat evenly over primer and block panels with precision.

&lt;p&gt;The shop is quiet except for the hiss of air through a regulator and the faint tick of cooling metal. You’ve just laid down a uniform film of high-build primer on a long quarter panel, the kind with a subtle crown that punishes any lapse in technique. Under raking LEDs, the surface looks good—flat at a glance, gray and matte like it should. But you know better. Until you perform disciplined guide coat sanding, there’s no honest way to read the surface. The panel has its history: tap-down marks from the last round of metalwork, a skim of filler you were careful not to overshape, and a featheredge that transitions into OEM finish along the dogleg. If any area is slightly low, the topcoat will amplify it like a megaphone.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/16.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding/cards/facebook/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding/cards/facebook/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding/cards/facebook/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding/cards/instagram/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding/cards/instagram/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding/cards/instagram/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding/cards/pinterest/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding/cards/pinterest/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding/cards/pinterest/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding/cards/facebook/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding/cards/facebook/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding/cards/facebook/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>13</readingTime></item><item><title>Edge Sanding Sequence To Match The Drum Sander Scratch</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/edge-sanding-sequence-to-match-the-drum-sander-scratch-edger-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/edge-sanding-sequence-to-match-the-drum-sander-scratch-edger-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 07 Dec 2025 18:13:47 +0000</pubDate><category>Floor &amp; Deck Sanding</category><category>grit-40</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit progression</category><category>sanding block</category><description>Learn a precise edger sanding sequence to blend edges with drum sander scratches and eliminate halos, swirls, and mismatched textures on hardwood floors.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="edger-sanding-sequence-to-match-drum-scratches"&gt;Edger sanding sequence to match drum scratches&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The afternoon light slid across your living room, catching the raw promise of bare wood. You’d pulled the last nail out, rented the big-machine sander, and felt that satisfying hum as years of finish lifted away in long, clean passes. The field of the floor looked even—linear, disciplined, almost new. Then your eyes drifted to the perimeter, that six to twelve inches along the baseboards where the drum could never reach. There, the grain looked different. A shadowy ring—soft at first—seemed to appear, like a halo you couldn’t unsee.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/14.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/edge-sanding-sequence-to-match-the-drum-sander-scratch-edger-sanding/cards/facebook/edge-sanding-sequence-to-match-the-drum-sander-scratch-edger-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/edge-sanding-sequence-to-match-the-drum-sander-scratch-edger-sanding/cards/facebook/edge-sanding-sequence-to-match-the-drum-sander-scratch-edger-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/edge-sanding-sequence-to-match-the-drum-sander-scratch-edger-sanding/cards/facebook/edge-sanding-sequence-to-match-the-drum-sander-scratch-edger-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/edge-sanding-sequence-to-match-the-drum-sander-scratch-edger-sanding/cards/instagram/edge-sanding-sequence-to-match-the-drum-sander-scratch-edger-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/edge-sanding-sequence-to-match-the-drum-sander-scratch-edger-sanding/cards/instagram/edge-sanding-sequence-to-match-the-drum-sander-scratch-edger-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/edge-sanding-sequence-to-match-the-drum-sander-scratch-edger-sanding/cards/instagram/edge-sanding-sequence-to-match-the-drum-sander-scratch-edger-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/edge-sanding-sequence-to-match-the-drum-sander-scratch-edger-sanding/cards/pinterest/edge-sanding-sequence-to-match-the-drum-sander-scratch-edger-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/edge-sanding-sequence-to-match-the-drum-sander-scratch-edger-sanding/cards/pinterest/edge-sanding-sequence-to-match-the-drum-sander-scratch-edger-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/edge-sanding-sequence-to-match-the-drum-sander-scratch-edger-sanding/cards/pinterest/edge-sanding-sequence-to-match-the-drum-sander-scratch-edger-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/edge-sanding-sequence-to-match-the-drum-sander-scratch-edger-sanding/cards/facebook/edge-sanding-sequence-to-match-the-drum-sander-scratch-edger-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/edge-sanding-sequence-to-match-the-drum-sander-scratch-edger-sanding/cards/facebook/edge-sanding-sequence-to-match-the-drum-sander-scratch-edger-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/edge-sanding-sequence-to-match-the-drum-sander-scratch-edger-sanding/cards/facebook/edge-sanding-sequence-to-match-the-drum-sander-scratch-edger-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Figure Eight Motion For Pole Sander On Walls</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/figure-eight-motion-for-pole-sander-on-walls-pole-sander-drywall/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/figure-eight-motion-for-pole-sander-on-walls-pole-sander-drywall/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 07 Dec 2025 16:34:58 +0000</pubDate><category>Drywall Sanding</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit progression</category><category>orbital sander</category><category>dust control</category><description>Master the figure‑eight motion for pole sanding drywall.

&lt;p&gt;The first time I learned the figure‑eight, it was 6 a.m., coffee in a paint-stained thermos, and a living room taped up like a crime scene. The house belonged to a neighbor who’d done an earnest DIY skim coat. The seams were proud, ridges crisp as a credit card. I’d already spent too many nights fighting walls with the wrong motion: straight up and down, back and forth, carving tracks with a pole head that liked to dig in at the end of each stroke. If you’ve ever wrestled a pole sander drywall on a long seam, you know that end-of-stroke gouge—the one that laughs at you when the primer hits it.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/12.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/figure-eight-motion-for-pole-sander-on-walls-pole-sander-drywall/cards/facebook/figure-eight-motion-for-pole-sander-on-walls-pole-sander-drywall.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/figure-eight-motion-for-pole-sander-on-walls-pole-sander-drywall/cards/facebook/figure-eight-motion-for-pole-sander-on-walls-pole-sander-drywall.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/figure-eight-motion-for-pole-sander-on-walls-pole-sander-drywall/cards/facebook/figure-eight-motion-for-pole-sander-on-walls-pole-sander-drywall.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/figure-eight-motion-for-pole-sander-on-walls-pole-sander-drywall/cards/instagram/figure-eight-motion-for-pole-sander-on-walls-pole-sander-drywall.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/figure-eight-motion-for-pole-sander-on-walls-pole-sander-drywall/cards/instagram/figure-eight-motion-for-pole-sander-on-walls-pole-sander-drywall.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/figure-eight-motion-for-pole-sander-on-walls-pole-sander-drywall/cards/instagram/figure-eight-motion-for-pole-sander-on-walls-pole-sander-drywall.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/figure-eight-motion-for-pole-sander-on-walls-pole-sander-drywall/cards/pinterest/figure-eight-motion-for-pole-sander-on-walls-pole-sander-drywall.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/figure-eight-motion-for-pole-sander-on-walls-pole-sander-drywall/cards/pinterest/figure-eight-motion-for-pole-sander-on-walls-pole-sander-drywall.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/figure-eight-motion-for-pole-sander-on-walls-pole-sander-drywall/cards/pinterest/figure-eight-motion-for-pole-sander-on-walls-pole-sander-drywall.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/figure-eight-motion-for-pole-sander-on-walls-pole-sander-drywall/cards/facebook/figure-eight-motion-for-pole-sander-on-walls-pole-sander-drywall.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/figure-eight-motion-for-pole-sander-on-walls-pole-sander-drywall/cards/facebook/figure-eight-motion-for-pole-sander-on-walls-pole-sander-drywall.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/figure-eight-motion-for-pole-sander-on-walls-pole-sander-drywall/cards/facebook/figure-eight-motion-for-pole-sander-on-walls-pole-sander-drywall.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Best Sanding Sponge Grit For Trim Surface Prep</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 07 Dec 2025 15:12:05 +0000</pubDate><category>Trim &amp; Molding Sanding</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-280</category><category>grit-320</category><category>dry sanding</category><category>sanding block</category><category>dust control</category><description>Engineer-tested guide to pick the best sponge for trim, from grit selection to technique, for flawless adhesion and smooth paint on wood and MDF.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="best-sponge-for-trim-sanding-grits-that-last"&gt;Best sponge for trim: sanding grits that last&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning light spilled across the hallway, revealing every chip and ridge along the baseboards that I’d stopped seeing months ago. The kind of small defects you only notice when you decide to fix them. I laid out the drop cloths and opened the can of trim enamel, mentally penciling in a half-day project. Then I reached for a sponge for trim instead of paper. That choice seems small, but it’s the difference between a paint job that looks good today and one that still looks good next year. As an engineer, I’ve learned that coatings fail at interfaces, not in the middle of the film. And the interface—the mechanical “tooth” you cut into the substrate—comes from your abrasives.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/10.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim/cards/facebook/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim/cards/facebook/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim/cards/facebook/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim/cards/instagram/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim/cards/instagram/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim/cards/instagram/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim/cards/pinterest/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim/cards/pinterest/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim/cards/pinterest/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim/cards/facebook/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim/cards/facebook/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim/cards/facebook/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>What Grit To Sand Furniture Before Applying Stain</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 07 Dec 2025 13:31:13 +0000</pubDate><category>Furniture Refinishing</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-800</category><category>orbital sander</category><category>sanding block</category><category>dust control</category><description>Learn the exact sanding grits, workflows, and checks that drive even stain color and professional results on furniture projects.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="stain-preparation-what-grit-to-sand-furniture"&gt;Stain Preparation: What Grit to Sand Furniture&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a quiet Saturday morning, you clear the dining table and pull the tarp tight. The surface is a patchwork of rings, scratches, and a few mystery stains from a previous life—nothing that an orbital sander and a little patience can’t fix. The smell of sawdust arrives quickly, and with it a deceptively simple choice: what grit to sand furniture before applying stain. There are plenty of opinions, but only one proper sequence for your species, stain type, and condition of the substrate. That decision—more than the brand of stain or even your brushing technique—will decide whether the grain pops evenly or blotches, whether the edges stay crisp or burn through, and whether your topcoat glides over a consistent scratch pattern or amplifies every swirl mark. Done right, stain preparation becomes a repeatable, almost meditative routine that pays off with reliable, beautiful finishes.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/08.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation/cards/facebook/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation/cards/facebook/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation/cards/facebook/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation/cards/instagram/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation/cards/instagram/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation/cards/instagram/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation/cards/pinterest/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation/cards/pinterest/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation/cards/pinterest/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation/cards/facebook/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation/cards/facebook/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation/cards/facebook/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>How To Find Hidden Cross Grain Scratches Before Finishing</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/06/how-to-find-hidden-cross-grain-scratches-before-finishing-cross-grain-scratch-re/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/06/how-to-find-hidden-cross-grain-scratches-before-finishing-cross-grain-scratch-re/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 06 Dec 2025 13:32:43 +0000</pubDate><category>Wood sanding</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit progression</category><category>clear coat</category><description>Learn how to spot hidden cross-grain scratches before finishing, with lighting, guide coats, and sanding strategies for flawless results.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="cross-grain-scratch-removal-find-flaws-before-finish"&gt;Cross-grain scratch removal: find flaws before finish&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s late in the day, and the shop is quiet enough to hear your own breath. You’ve planed, scraped, and sanded a walnut tabletop into a silky plane that reflects light like calm water. The first wipe of finish goes on and your shoulders loosen—until the sheen turns and a faint zebra pattern ghosts across the surface. There they are: those fine cross-grain scratches that seemed invisible a moment ago, now stark under the finish. We talk a lot about sanding sequences, but the real craft is knowing how to find the marks you can’t yet see—and to do it before a finish locks them in forever. That’s the heart of cross-grain scratch removal: finding and fixing the tiny, off-direction lines that explode under dye, oil, or film, and keeping them from stealing focus from the piece you worked so hard to build.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/06.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/06/how-to-find-hidden-cross-grain-scratches-before-finishing-cross-grain-scratch-re/cards/facebook/how-to-find-hidden-cross-grain-scratches-before-finishing-cross-grain-scratch-re.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/06/how-to-find-hidden-cross-grain-scratches-before-finishing-cross-grain-scratch-re/cards/facebook/how-to-find-hidden-cross-grain-scratches-before-finishing-cross-grain-scratch-re.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/06/how-to-find-hidden-cross-grain-scratches-before-finishing-cross-grain-scratch-re/cards/facebook/how-to-find-hidden-cross-grain-scratches-before-finishing-cross-grain-scratch-re.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/06/how-to-find-hidden-cross-grain-scratches-before-finishing-cross-grain-scratch-re/cards/instagram/how-to-find-hidden-cross-grain-scratches-before-finishing-cross-grain-scratch-re.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/06/how-to-find-hidden-cross-grain-scratches-before-finishing-cross-grain-scratch-re/cards/instagram/how-to-find-hidden-cross-grain-scratches-before-finishing-cross-grain-scratch-re.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/06/how-to-find-hidden-cross-grain-scratches-before-finishing-cross-grain-scratch-re/cards/instagram/how-to-find-hidden-cross-grain-scratches-before-finishing-cross-grain-scratch-re.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/06/how-to-find-hidden-cross-grain-scratches-before-finishing-cross-grain-scratch-re/cards/pinterest/how-to-find-hidden-cross-grain-scratches-before-finishing-cross-grain-scratch-re.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/06/how-to-find-hidden-cross-grain-scratches-before-finishing-cross-grain-scratch-re/cards/pinterest/how-to-find-hidden-cross-grain-scratches-before-finishing-cross-grain-scratch-re.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/06/how-to-find-hidden-cross-grain-scratches-before-finishing-cross-grain-scratch-re/cards/pinterest/how-to-find-hidden-cross-grain-scratches-before-finishing-cross-grain-scratch-re.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/06/how-to-find-hidden-cross-grain-scratches-before-finishing-cross-grain-scratch-re/cards/facebook/how-to-find-hidden-cross-grain-scratches-before-finishing-cross-grain-scratch-re.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/06/how-to-find-hidden-cross-grain-scratches-before-finishing-cross-grain-scratch-re/cards/facebook/how-to-find-hidden-cross-grain-scratches-before-finishing-cross-grain-scratch-re.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/06/how-to-find-hidden-cross-grain-scratches-before-finishing-cross-grain-scratch-re/cards/facebook/how-to-find-hidden-cross-grain-scratches-before-finishing-cross-grain-scratch-re.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Microscope Inspection Of Scratch Patterns</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/microscope-inspection-of-scratch-patterns-abrasive-testing/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/microscope-inspection-of-scratch-patterns-abrasive-testing/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 05 Dec 2025 14:26:01 +0000</pubDate><category>Abrasive Innovation &amp; Testing</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Learn how to inspect scratch patterns under a microscope, link them to abrasive testing, and tune your workflow for sharper finishes and reliable results.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="microscope-scratch-inspection-for-abrasive-testing"&gt;Microscope Scratch Inspection for Abrasive Testing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know the feeling: the shop is quiet, the extractor hums, and that last pass felt right. You lift the part—maybe it’s a glass coupon, a knife bevel, a sanded guitar neck, or a brushed aluminum panel—and for a second it looks flawless. Then you slide it under the microscope, roll the focus, and the story changes. The surface that looked satin-smooth at arm’s length shows a lattice of scratches, smeared streaks from a loaded belt, and the ghost of an earlier grit you didn’t fully erase. That’s where abrasive testing and disciplined microscope work pay for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/04.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/microscope-inspection-of-scratch-patterns-abrasive-testing/cards/facebook/microscope-inspection-of-scratch-patterns-abrasive-testing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/microscope-inspection-of-scratch-patterns-abrasive-testing/cards/facebook/microscope-inspection-of-scratch-patterns-abrasive-testing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/microscope-inspection-of-scratch-patterns-abrasive-testing/cards/facebook/microscope-inspection-of-scratch-patterns-abrasive-testing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/microscope-inspection-of-scratch-patterns-abrasive-testing/cards/instagram/microscope-inspection-of-scratch-patterns-abrasive-testing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/microscope-inspection-of-scratch-patterns-abrasive-testing/cards/instagram/microscope-inspection-of-scratch-patterns-abrasive-testing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/microscope-inspection-of-scratch-patterns-abrasive-testing/cards/instagram/microscope-inspection-of-scratch-patterns-abrasive-testing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/microscope-inspection-of-scratch-patterns-abrasive-testing/cards/pinterest/microscope-inspection-of-scratch-patterns-abrasive-testing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/microscope-inspection-of-scratch-patterns-abrasive-testing/cards/pinterest/microscope-inspection-of-scratch-patterns-abrasive-testing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/microscope-inspection-of-scratch-patterns-abrasive-testing/cards/pinterest/microscope-inspection-of-scratch-patterns-abrasive-testing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/microscope-inspection-of-scratch-patterns-abrasive-testing/cards/facebook/microscope-inspection-of-scratch-patterns-abrasive-testing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/microscope-inspection-of-scratch-patterns-abrasive-testing/cards/facebook/microscope-inspection-of-scratch-patterns-abrasive-testing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/microscope-inspection-of-scratch-patterns-abrasive-testing/cards/facebook/microscope-inspection-of-scratch-patterns-abrasive-testing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Wrap Sandpaper Around Dowels For Curved Edges</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 05 Dec 2025 13:37:54 +0000</pubDate><category>Hand Sanding Techniques</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Practical guide to hand sanding curved edges by wrapping sandpaper around dowels; testing abrasives, grits, and jigs for consistent radii.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="hand-sanding-curves-wrap-paper-around-dowels"&gt;Hand Sanding Curves: Wrap Paper Around Dowels&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember the first time a curve made me question my craft. It was a walnut keepsake box with a lid that looked perfect on CAD: a soft 10 mm radius running cleanly along all four edges. On the bench, though, the radius fought back. My block sander flattened the apex, my random-orbit sander skated off the edge, and every “shortcut” I tried left flats and chatter marks that showed up under finish like neon. I finally reached for the simplest tool in the shop: a hardwood dowel, a strip of abrasive, and my hands. With careful hand sanding—wrapping the paper around a dowel that matched the profile—the radius began to read as a continuous curve instead of a sequence of mistakes. The tactile feedback told me where the high spots were; the scratch pattern told me when I was pushing too hard.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/02.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding/cards/instagram/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding/cards/instagram/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding/cards/instagram/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding/cards/pinterest/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding/cards/pinterest/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding/cards/pinterest/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Reusable Sponges To Reduce Waste</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 17:37:43 +0000</pubDate><category>Eco &amp; Non-Toxic Abrasives</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>dry sanding</category><category>paint prep</category><category>dust control</category><category>joint compound</category><description>Expert guide to eco sandpaper and reusable sponges: prep, grit strategy, cleaning cycles, and workflows that reduce waste without compromising finish.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="eco-sandpaper-and-reusable-sanding-sponges"&gt;Eco sandpaper and reusable sanding sponges&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a Saturday morning, I stood over a maple desk that had seen too many years of coffee rings and hurried notes. The sun cut across the shop floor, catching dust motes suspended in a quiet orbit around the project that would—if I did this right—become an heirloom. Next to me sat a half-empty box of worn paper sheets and a small pile of discarded grits I’d promised myself I’d send to recycling (a promise I rarely kept). It felt familiar and a little defeating: endless sheets, clogged in minutes, and a small mountain of waste. That was the morning I switched the workflow, integrating reusable sanding sponges and eco sandpaper into a process designed not just for finish quality, but for sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/29.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper/cards/instagram/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper/cards/instagram/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper/cards/instagram/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Backing Pad Compatibility Issues</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/backing-pad-compatibility-issues-best-sandpaper-brand/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/backing-pad-compatibility-issues-best-sandpaper-brand/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 15:50:39 +0000</pubDate><category>Brand &amp; Quality Comparison</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Understand backing pad compatibility and the best sandpaper brand for your sander.

&lt;p&gt;You know the moment I mean: the shop is quiet except for the hum of your sander, the piece is clamped and ready, and you’re thinking about finish, not failure. Then the disc starts to lift at the edge, or the sander chatters, leaving tiny half-moons where there should be a smooth, steady haze. In that split second, your focus moves from the project to the pad. If you’ve ever searched for the best sandpaper brand to “fix it,” you’ve probably noticed that the real story is compatibility—how your backing pad and abrasive actually work together.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/27.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/backing-pad-compatibility-issues-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/facebook/backing-pad-compatibility-issues-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/backing-pad-compatibility-issues-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/facebook/backing-pad-compatibility-issues-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/backing-pad-compatibility-issues-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/facebook/backing-pad-compatibility-issues-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/backing-pad-compatibility-issues-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/instagram/backing-pad-compatibility-issues-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/backing-pad-compatibility-issues-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/instagram/backing-pad-compatibility-issues-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/backing-pad-compatibility-issues-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/instagram/backing-pad-compatibility-issues-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/backing-pad-compatibility-issues-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/pinterest/backing-pad-compatibility-issues-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/backing-pad-compatibility-issues-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/pinterest/backing-pad-compatibility-issues-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/backing-pad-compatibility-issues-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/pinterest/backing-pad-compatibility-issues-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/backing-pad-compatibility-issues-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/facebook/backing-pad-compatibility-issues-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/backing-pad-compatibility-issues-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/facebook/backing-pad-compatibility-issues-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/backing-pad-compatibility-issues-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/facebook/backing-pad-compatibility-issues-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Stearated Coatings For Load Resistance</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/stearated-coatings-for-load-resistance-open-coat-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/stearated-coatings-for-load-resistance-open-coat-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 14:21:48 +0000</pubDate><category>Backing Types &amp; Coatings</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-220</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>Beat clogging and heat.

&lt;p&gt;It’s Saturday morning in the shop—the kind where the coffee cools on the bench because you’re in a flow state. You square up your random-orbit sander over a pine cabinet door you’ve been meaning to refinish. Two passes in, the pad stalls, dust smears into a chalky cake, and the disc stops cutting. We’ve all been there: soft wood, resin pockets, a touch of old varnish, and sandpaper that loads up faster than you can tap it clean. That’s when I reach for open coat sandpaper paired with a stearated coating. It’s the combination that keeps abrasive cutting edges exposed while a dry “lubricant” layer sheds paint, pitch, and finish dust instead of letting it fuse to the grit.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/25.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/stearated-coatings-for-load-resistance-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/stearated-coatings-for-load-resistance-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/stearated-coatings-for-load-resistance-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/stearated-coatings-for-load-resistance-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/stearated-coatings-for-load-resistance-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/stearated-coatings-for-load-resistance-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/stearated-coatings-for-load-resistance-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/instagram/stearated-coatings-for-load-resistance-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/stearated-coatings-for-load-resistance-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/instagram/stearated-coatings-for-load-resistance-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/stearated-coatings-for-load-resistance-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/instagram/stearated-coatings-for-load-resistance-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/stearated-coatings-for-load-resistance-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/stearated-coatings-for-load-resistance-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/stearated-coatings-for-load-resistance-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/stearated-coatings-for-load-resistance-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/stearated-coatings-for-load-resistance-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/stearated-coatings-for-load-resistance-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/stearated-coatings-for-load-resistance-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/stearated-coatings-for-load-resistance-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/stearated-coatings-for-load-resistance-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/stearated-coatings-for-load-resistance-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/stearated-coatings-for-load-resistance-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/stearated-coatings-for-load-resistance-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Open Coat Versus Closed Coat Impacts</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 13:41:49 +0000</pubDate><category>Abrasive Materials &amp; Compounds</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-1200</category><description>Open vs closed coat sanding explained with lab-tested data.

&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning in the shop is supposed to be simple: one mug of coffee, a walnut desktop to final-sand, and a couple of hours of quiet before the house wakes up. Instead, at pass number fifteen, the paper glazes over. The dust lines smear into the grain, and the sander’s pitch changes—a small but telling protest. I switch sheets, still chasing that consistent, haze-free scratch pattern. When I move to wet-sand a lacquer test panel, silicon carbide sandpaper comes out of the drawer—its black grit and smooth backing a distinct contrast to the tan aluminum oxide I’ve used on the walnut. Ten minutes later, I’m flattening a glued-up end-grain cutting board, then stepping over to clean up a steel plane body. Same sander, same operator, but suddenly my results diverge depending on one detail I often overlook: how densely the abrasive grains were packed onto the paper in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/23.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/instagram/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/instagram/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/instagram/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Slurry Management During Wet Grinding</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/03/slurry-management-during-wet-grinding-concrete-polishing/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/03/slurry-management-during-wet-grinding-concrete-polishing/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 03 Dec 2025 13:41:04 +0000</pubDate><category>Stone &amp; Concrete Polishing</category><category>grit-40</category><category>grit-70</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Learn expert slurry management for wet grinding and concrete polishing—chemistry, tooling, workflow, and compliance to deliver consistent, high-gloss floors.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="wet-grinding-slurry-control-for-concrete-polishing"&gt;Wet Grinding Slurry Control for Concrete Polishing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s 6:10 a.m. in a silent warehouse. Air is cool, lights are still buzzing to full brightness, and the crew is rolling out hoses and laying edge-protection mats with the practiced choreography of a hundred previous jobs. The general contractor walks the space with a client, tracing imagined traffic patterns in the air: this will be a public lobby, high reflectivity, no coating, a breathable sheen that wears in gracefully, not off in flakes. On-site expectations like these live or die by process discipline. Everyone agrees on the end state—clean clarity, sharp aggregate reveal—but the real determinant of that result begins long before the burnish. It starts with water, abrasives, and the wet byproduct the team will generate hour after hour. It starts with slurry.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/21.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/03/slurry-management-during-wet-grinding-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/slurry-management-during-wet-grinding-concrete-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/03/slurry-management-during-wet-grinding-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/slurry-management-during-wet-grinding-concrete-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/03/slurry-management-during-wet-grinding-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/slurry-management-during-wet-grinding-concrete-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/03/slurry-management-during-wet-grinding-concrete-polishing/cards/instagram/slurry-management-during-wet-grinding-concrete-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/03/slurry-management-during-wet-grinding-concrete-polishing/cards/instagram/slurry-management-during-wet-grinding-concrete-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/03/slurry-management-during-wet-grinding-concrete-polishing/cards/instagram/slurry-management-during-wet-grinding-concrete-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/03/slurry-management-during-wet-grinding-concrete-polishing/cards/pinterest/slurry-management-during-wet-grinding-concrete-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/03/slurry-management-during-wet-grinding-concrete-polishing/cards/pinterest/slurry-management-during-wet-grinding-concrete-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/03/slurry-management-during-wet-grinding-concrete-polishing/cards/pinterest/slurry-management-during-wet-grinding-concrete-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/03/slurry-management-during-wet-grinding-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/slurry-management-during-wet-grinding-concrete-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/03/slurry-management-during-wet-grinding-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/slurry-management-during-wet-grinding-concrete-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/03/slurry-management-during-wet-grinding-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/slurry-management-during-wet-grinding-concrete-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Smooth Fairing Compound Before Primer</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/02/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/02/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 02 Dec 2025 13:43:25 +0000</pubDate><category>Marine Sanding</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>dry sanding</category><category>primer coat</category><description>Master boat sanding and fairing for a glass-smooth base before primer.

&lt;p&gt;You can hear it before you see it: the soft rasp of paper across gelcoat, the shush-shush rhythm that turns a scuffed hull into something you can be proud of. Boat sanding isn’t exactly glamorous, but on a still morning—coffee perched on a dock post, gulls trading gossip overhead—it feels like craft. Your fingers become the first inspectors, gliding across highs and lows. The goal isn’t just clean; it’s consistent. When you’re aiming for smooth fairing compound before primer, you’re making a commitment to what comes next: paint that lays down like glass, reflections that don’t ripple, and time on the water that starts sooner because you did the prep right.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/19.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/02/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/02/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/02/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/02/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding/cards/instagram/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/02/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding/cards/instagram/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/02/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding/cards/instagram/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/02/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding/cards/pinterest/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/02/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding/cards/pinterest/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/02/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding/cards/pinterest/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/02/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/02/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/02/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Reduce Chipping With Light Pressure</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 01 Dec 2025 17:57:57 +0000</pubDate><category>Glass &amp; Ceramics Sanding</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-1200</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>Learn glass sanding techniques to prevent chipping.

&lt;p&gt;The first clink is always the loudest. You set the pane on a padded bench, nudge it into square, and that tiny tick of glass on glass makes your shoulders tense. If you’ve worked with glass—bottles you’ve upcycled, aquarium panels you’ve drilled, a mirror you’ve cut—you know the feeling. The fear isn’t shattering; it’s those sneaky micro-chips that show up right when you’re almost done. The good news is we can control them. With glass sanding done right and a feather-light touch, you’ll get clean edges that don’t snowflake into chips, even under stress.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/17.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding/cards/instagram/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding/cards/instagram/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding/cards/instagram/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding/cards/pinterest/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding/cards/pinterest/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding/cards/pinterest/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Avoid Overheating Edges During Polish</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/avoid-overheating-edges-during-polish-resin-polishing/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/avoid-overheating-edges-during-polish-resin-polishing/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 01 Dec 2025 16:10:07 +0000</pubDate><category>Resin Polishing</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>wet sanding</category><description>Engineer-tested methods to keep resin edges cool while polishing.

&lt;p&gt;The first time I overheated a resin edge, it looked perfect—right up until it wasn’t. The surface was glossy, but the perimeter turned milky, then smeared like warm butter under a rotary pad. I could smell the polymer heating. It felt like a setback on a simple task: sanding and finishing a handmade resin coaster. If you’ve been there, you know the mix of frustration and “what did I do wrong?” It’s not lack of care; it’s physics. That edge has less mass to absorb heat, and during resin polishing you’re pushing friction and pressure into a tiny contact patch. Heat has nowhere to go.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/15.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/avoid-overheating-edges-during-polish-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/avoid-overheating-edges-during-polish-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/avoid-overheating-edges-during-polish-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/avoid-overheating-edges-during-polish-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/avoid-overheating-edges-during-polish-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/avoid-overheating-edges-during-polish-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/avoid-overheating-edges-during-polish-resin-polishing/cards/instagram/avoid-overheating-edges-during-polish-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/avoid-overheating-edges-during-polish-resin-polishing/cards/instagram/avoid-overheating-edges-during-polish-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/avoid-overheating-edges-during-polish-resin-polishing/cards/instagram/avoid-overheating-edges-during-polish-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/avoid-overheating-edges-during-polish-resin-polishing/cards/pinterest/avoid-overheating-edges-during-polish-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/avoid-overheating-edges-during-polish-resin-polishing/cards/pinterest/avoid-overheating-edges-during-polish-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/avoid-overheating-edges-during-polish-resin-polishing/cards/pinterest/avoid-overheating-edges-during-polish-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/avoid-overheating-edges-during-polish-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/avoid-overheating-edges-during-polish-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/avoid-overheating-edges-during-polish-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/avoid-overheating-edges-during-polish-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/avoid-overheating-edges-during-polish-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/avoid-overheating-edges-during-polish-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Refine To 2000–3000 For Quick Polish</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 01 Dec 2025 15:17:23 +0000</pubDate><category>Plastic &amp; Epoxy Sanding</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>Master epoxy sanding from 800 to 2000–3000 grit for a fast, haze-free polish with pro-level technique, abrasives, and workflow control.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="epoxy-sanding-quick-polish-at-20003000-grit"&gt;Epoxy Sanding: Quick Polish at 2000–3000 Grit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You set the project down with both hands, the way you place a full coffee mug on a brand-new table—carefully, like it could bruise. Yesterday it was a cloudy slab: dust nibs, tiny ripples, a faint orange peel. Today, it’s close. Under the shop LEDs, you can already see straight lines in the reflection, but not a perfect mirror—still a little fog, still a couple of shallow witness lines that your eyes keep returning to. The moment is tempting: grab a compound and try to bully the gloss into existence. But you’ve done this long enough to know that shine doesn’t come from polish alone; it’s earned in the scratch pattern. This is where epoxy sanding decides whether you’ll be buffing for minutes or for hours, whether the finish will hold up in sunlight or betray you with haloed swirls.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/13.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding/cards/instagram/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding/cards/instagram/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding/cards/instagram/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding/cards/pinterest/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding/cards/pinterest/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding/cards/pinterest/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>When To Choose Trizact Style Abrasives</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 01 Dec 2025 13:40:34 +0000</pubDate><category>Specialty Abrasives</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Learn when to choose Trizact style abrasives vs microfinishing film.

&lt;p&gt;The shop is quiet in the way only focused work can create—overhead lights humming, a small radio whispering in the corner, and the soft, steady rasp of a belt skimming steel. You’ve shaped a kitchen knife from bar stock, or maybe you’re prepping a classic car panel after welding in a patch. The hard work is done, but the finish is still miles away from what you picture: clean, even, and confident. You swap belts, try a different disc, lighten pressure, and still those stubborn lines hang on. Do you step to a more aggressive grit? Switch to a finer one? Or change the abrasive altogether?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/11.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film/cards/instagram/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film/cards/instagram/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film/cards/instagram/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film/cards/pinterest/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film/cards/pinterest/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film/cards/pinterest/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Wet Sanding Sequence 1000 To 3000 Grit</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/30/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/30/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 30 Nov 2025 13:32:41 +0000</pubDate><category>Waterproof &amp; Wet/Dry Paper</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-2500</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>clear coat</category><category>dry sanding</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Learn a pro-approved wet sanding sequence from 1000 to 3000 grit using wet dry sandpaper.

&lt;p&gt;The garage is quiet except for the steady drip from a hose into a plastic pail. You’ve taped off the washer nozzles, masked the edges, and laid out your gear like a surgeon. A foam block, a spray bottle with soapy water, microfiber towels, and a neat stack of wet dry sandpaper—1000, 2000, and 3000 grit—each sheet pre-cut and soaking. If you’ve ever stared at a hood that looked great at sunset but awful under the driveway floodlight—orange peel, dust nibs, faint sanding traces from an old repair—you know the itch to fix it properly. Today’s the day you turn that itch into an even, glassy finish with a controlled wet sanding sequence from 1000 to 3000 grit.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/09.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/30/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/30/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/30/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/30/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/instagram/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/30/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/instagram/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/30/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/instagram/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/30/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/30/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/30/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/30/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/30/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/30/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Pair Ceramics With Dust Extraction</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/29/pair-ceramics-with-dust-extraction-ceramic-sanding-discs/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/29/pair-ceramics-with-dust-extraction-ceramic-sanding-discs/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 29 Nov 2025 13:31:32 +0000</pubDate><category>Ceramic &amp; Premium Abrasives</category><category>grit-400</category><description>Engineer-tested guide to pairing ceramic sanding discs with dust extraction for cleaner air, longer disc life, and faster, cooler cuts on wood, metal, and</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="ceramic-sanding-discs-and-dust-extraction-guide"&gt;Ceramic Sanding Discs and Dust Extraction Guide&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s 7:10 p.m. in the garage, and you’re chasing the last coat-leveling pass on a maple tabletop. The light catches a swirl here, a rough patch there—and a cloud of fine dust that you don’t fully register until the sharp smell of lignin and heat hits. You stop to wipe your safety glasses, but the haze hangs on. The disc feels glazed, the sander runs hotter, and progress slows. I’ve been there dozens of times. Switching to a better abrasive helps, but the real unlock came when I paired high-performance ceramic sanding discs with a properly tuned dust extraction setup. The first night I dialed it in, the air stayed clear, the finish looked even, and my disc cut like it was fresh—for far longer than I expected.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/07.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/29/pair-ceramics-with-dust-extraction-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/pair-ceramics-with-dust-extraction-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/29/pair-ceramics-with-dust-extraction-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/pair-ceramics-with-dust-extraction-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/29/pair-ceramics-with-dust-extraction-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/pair-ceramics-with-dust-extraction-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/29/pair-ceramics-with-dust-extraction-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/pair-ceramics-with-dust-extraction-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/29/pair-ceramics-with-dust-extraction-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/pair-ceramics-with-dust-extraction-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/29/pair-ceramics-with-dust-extraction-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/pair-ceramics-with-dust-extraction-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/29/pair-ceramics-with-dust-extraction-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/pair-ceramics-with-dust-extraction-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/29/pair-ceramics-with-dust-extraction-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/pair-ceramics-with-dust-extraction-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/29/pair-ceramics-with-dust-extraction-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/pair-ceramics-with-dust-extraction-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/29/pair-ceramics-with-dust-extraction-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/pair-ceramics-with-dust-extraction-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/29/pair-ceramics-with-dust-extraction-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/pair-ceramics-with-dust-extraction-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/29/pair-ceramics-with-dust-extraction-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/pair-ceramics-with-dust-extraction-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Verify Scratch Removal Before Moving Up</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/28/verify-scratch-removal-before-moving-up-sandpaper-grit-chart/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/28/verify-scratch-removal-before-moving-up-sandpaper-grit-chart/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 28 Nov 2025 14:38:49 +0000</pubDate><category>Grit Guide &amp; Education</category><category>grit chart</category><category>abrasive standards</category><category>grit progression</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><description>How to verify scratch removal before moving up grits, using a sandpaper grit chart, lighting, and workflow controls for flawless finishes.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="sandpaper-grit-chart-verify-scratches-before-upgrading"&gt;Sandpaper Grit Chart: Verify Scratches Before Upgrading&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a quiet Saturday morning, you clamp down a panel you’ve been saving for a fresh finish—maybe a guitar body, a dresser drawer front, or a primered door skin. Coffee’s cooling. The shop is clean, the plan is set, and your stack of abrasives sits like a neatly organized ladder next to your bench. You’ve mapped your progression: P120 for shaping, P180 to refine, P220 to remove print-through, then P320 for primer surfacing. A sandpaper grit chart is within reach, annotated with your go-to sequences. The temptation is strong to move briskly through those steps. After all, each finer grit will “clean up” the last, right?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/05.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/28/verify-scratch-removal-before-moving-up-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/verify-scratch-removal-before-moving-up-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/28/verify-scratch-removal-before-moving-up-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/verify-scratch-removal-before-moving-up-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/28/verify-scratch-removal-before-moving-up-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/verify-scratch-removal-before-moving-up-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/28/verify-scratch-removal-before-moving-up-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/instagram/verify-scratch-removal-before-moving-up-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/28/verify-scratch-removal-before-moving-up-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/instagram/verify-scratch-removal-before-moving-up-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/28/verify-scratch-removal-before-moving-up-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/instagram/verify-scratch-removal-before-moving-up-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/28/verify-scratch-removal-before-moving-up-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/pinterest/verify-scratch-removal-before-moving-up-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/28/verify-scratch-removal-before-moving-up-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/pinterest/verify-scratch-removal-before-moving-up-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/28/verify-scratch-removal-before-moving-up-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/pinterest/verify-scratch-removal-before-moving-up-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/28/verify-scratch-removal-before-moving-up-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/verify-scratch-removal-before-moving-up-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/28/verify-scratch-removal-before-moving-up-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/verify-scratch-removal-before-moving-up-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/28/verify-scratch-removal-before-moving-up-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/verify-scratch-removal-before-moving-up-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Seal Fittings To Prevent Vacuum Leaks</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/28/seal-fittings-to-prevent-vacuum-leaks-dustless-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/28/seal-fittings-to-prevent-vacuum-leaks-dustless-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 28 Nov 2025 13:35:39 +0000</pubDate><category>Dust Extraction Systems</category><category>grit-60</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>Learn how to seal fittings to prevent vacuum leaks for cleaner, safer dustless sanding.

&lt;p&gt;You notice the air first. It’s still. The living room is taped off, the baseboards are off, and your heart is set on getting through the weekend project without a whiteout of debris coating every surface you own. Your plan is simple: refinish the floors with dustless sanding so you can skip the week-long cleanup and the endless sneezing. The shop vac hums, your sander spins up, and for a few minutes it feels like a win. Then the hose trembles. A faint hiss rises near a quick-connect. You see it—the telltale plume of fines floating off the pad. You lift your mask a touch, eyes scanning the fittings. The promise of an almost dust-free job hinges on the invisible: airtight connections.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/03.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/28/seal-fittings-to-prevent-vacuum-leaks-dustless-sanding/cards/facebook/seal-fittings-to-prevent-vacuum-leaks-dustless-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/28/seal-fittings-to-prevent-vacuum-leaks-dustless-sanding/cards/facebook/seal-fittings-to-prevent-vacuum-leaks-dustless-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/28/seal-fittings-to-prevent-vacuum-leaks-dustless-sanding/cards/facebook/seal-fittings-to-prevent-vacuum-leaks-dustless-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/28/seal-fittings-to-prevent-vacuum-leaks-dustless-sanding/cards/instagram/seal-fittings-to-prevent-vacuum-leaks-dustless-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/28/seal-fittings-to-prevent-vacuum-leaks-dustless-sanding/cards/instagram/seal-fittings-to-prevent-vacuum-leaks-dustless-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/28/seal-fittings-to-prevent-vacuum-leaks-dustless-sanding/cards/instagram/seal-fittings-to-prevent-vacuum-leaks-dustless-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/28/seal-fittings-to-prevent-vacuum-leaks-dustless-sanding/cards/pinterest/seal-fittings-to-prevent-vacuum-leaks-dustless-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/28/seal-fittings-to-prevent-vacuum-leaks-dustless-sanding/cards/pinterest/seal-fittings-to-prevent-vacuum-leaks-dustless-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/28/seal-fittings-to-prevent-vacuum-leaks-dustless-sanding/cards/pinterest/seal-fittings-to-prevent-vacuum-leaks-dustless-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/28/seal-fittings-to-prevent-vacuum-leaks-dustless-sanding/cards/facebook/seal-fittings-to-prevent-vacuum-leaks-dustless-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/28/seal-fittings-to-prevent-vacuum-leaks-dustless-sanding/cards/facebook/seal-fittings-to-prevent-vacuum-leaks-dustless-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/28/seal-fittings-to-prevent-vacuum-leaks-dustless-sanding/cards/facebook/seal-fittings-to-prevent-vacuum-leaks-dustless-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Use Hard Backing Pads For Flat Panels</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/27/use-hard-backing-pads-for-flat-panels-sander-interface-pad/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/27/use-hard-backing-pads-for-flat-panels-sander-interface-pad/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 27 Nov 2025 14:34:47 +0000</pubDate><category>Interface Pads &amp; Backing Pads</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-360</category><category>paint prep</category><description>Get pro-flat panels with hard backing pads.

&lt;p&gt;There’s a certain hush that falls over the shop when a panel finally reads flat. The lights reflect in a clean, uninterrupted glide across the grain, and you can feel the promise of that finish under your fingertips. I remember a maple tabletop that fought me for three late nights. I had a soft pad on my sander, a foam disc, and the hope that “gentle” would keep me safe. Instead, the board smiled back at me with a washboard of highs and lows. Swirls near the edges, dipped corners, and a telegraphed glue line that wouldn’t die. The fix wasn’t more time; it was the right pad. I swapped to a hard backing pad, parked a sander interface pad for the profiles and inside corners, and the surface transformed—crisp, even, and ready to finish. That day, I stopped thinking of pads as accessories and started treating them like cutting tools.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/01.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/27/use-hard-backing-pads-for-flat-panels-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/use-hard-backing-pads-for-flat-panels-sander-interface-pad.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/27/use-hard-backing-pads-for-flat-panels-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/use-hard-backing-pads-for-flat-panels-sander-interface-pad.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/27/use-hard-backing-pads-for-flat-panels-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/use-hard-backing-pads-for-flat-panels-sander-interface-pad.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/27/use-hard-backing-pads-for-flat-panels-sander-interface-pad/cards/instagram/use-hard-backing-pads-for-flat-panels-sander-interface-pad.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/27/use-hard-backing-pads-for-flat-panels-sander-interface-pad/cards/instagram/use-hard-backing-pads-for-flat-panels-sander-interface-pad.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/27/use-hard-backing-pads-for-flat-panels-sander-interface-pad/cards/instagram/use-hard-backing-pads-for-flat-panels-sander-interface-pad.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/27/use-hard-backing-pads-for-flat-panels-sander-interface-pad/cards/pinterest/use-hard-backing-pads-for-flat-panels-sander-interface-pad.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/27/use-hard-backing-pads-for-flat-panels-sander-interface-pad/cards/pinterest/use-hard-backing-pads-for-flat-panels-sander-interface-pad.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/27/use-hard-backing-pads-for-flat-panels-sander-interface-pad/cards/pinterest/use-hard-backing-pads-for-flat-panels-sander-interface-pad.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/27/use-hard-backing-pads-for-flat-panels-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/use-hard-backing-pads-for-flat-panels-sander-interface-pad.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/27/use-hard-backing-pads-for-flat-panels-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/use-hard-backing-pads-for-flat-panels-sander-interface-pad.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/27/use-hard-backing-pads-for-flat-panels-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/use-hard-backing-pads-for-flat-panels-sander-interface-pad.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Psa Discs For Aggressive Stock Removal</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/27/psa-discs-for-aggressive-stock-removal-psa-sanding-discs/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/27/psa-discs-for-aggressive-stock-removal-psa-sanding-discs/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 27 Nov 2025 13:37:06 +0000</pubDate><category>PSA Discs</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-360</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Engineer-tested guide to PSA sanding discs for rapid stock removal: materials, grit strategy, heat control, and setup tips for wood and metal.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="psa-sanding-discs-for-aggressive-stock-removal"&gt;PSA Sanding Discs for Aggressive Stock Removal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still remember the first time I leveled a twisted maple slab on a big, humming disc sander. The shop was quiet except for the steady hiss of grit meeting wood and the faint thrum of a balanced steel plate spinning up to speed. It was a late night build—coffee cooling on the bench, layout pencil lines still on the slab. I needed flat and fast, not pretty. Hook-and-loop discs had been slipping and smearing, and I was burning edges before I even got close to level. Swapping to psa sanding discs felt mundane in the moment—peel, align, stick—but the result wasn’t. The interface stopped flexing. The contact became honest. Stock disappeared, angles held, and the surface came out flat enough that a straightedge was suddenly interesting again.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/28.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/27/psa-discs-for-aggressive-stock-removal-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/psa-discs-for-aggressive-stock-removal-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/27/psa-discs-for-aggressive-stock-removal-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/psa-discs-for-aggressive-stock-removal-psa-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/27/psa-discs-for-aggressive-stock-removal-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/psa-discs-for-aggressive-stock-removal-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/27/psa-discs-for-aggressive-stock-removal-psa-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/psa-discs-for-aggressive-stock-removal-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/27/psa-discs-for-aggressive-stock-removal-psa-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/psa-discs-for-aggressive-stock-removal-psa-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/27/psa-discs-for-aggressive-stock-removal-psa-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/psa-discs-for-aggressive-stock-removal-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/27/psa-discs-for-aggressive-stock-removal-psa-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/psa-discs-for-aggressive-stock-removal-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/27/psa-discs-for-aggressive-stock-removal-psa-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/psa-discs-for-aggressive-stock-removal-psa-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/27/psa-discs-for-aggressive-stock-removal-psa-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/psa-discs-for-aggressive-stock-removal-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/27/psa-discs-for-aggressive-stock-removal-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/psa-discs-for-aggressive-stock-removal-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/27/psa-discs-for-aggressive-stock-removal-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/psa-discs-for-aggressive-stock-removal-psa-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/27/psa-discs-for-aggressive-stock-removal-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/psa-discs-for-aggressive-stock-removal-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>13</readingTime></item><item><title>Best Grits For Automotive Sanding Discs</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/26/best-grits-for-automotive-sanding-discs-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/26/best-grits-for-automotive-sanding-discs-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 26 Nov 2025 14:17:48 +0000</pubDate><category>Hook-and-Loop Discs</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-360</category><category>dust control</category><description>Learn the best grits for automotive sanding discs, with precise workflows, abrasive choices, and pro tips for faster, flatter finishes using hook and loop</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="best-grits-for-automotive-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs"&gt;Best Grits for Automotive Hook and Loop Sanding Discs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The garage is quiet except for the soft thrum of a dual-action sander spooling up, and the faint sweetness of primer in the air. Your project is a faded fender you’ve stared at for months—part nostalgia, part challenge. You’ve taped edges, set a new backup pad, and slipped on a fresh pack of hook and loop sanding discs, ready to erase rust blooms and orange peel like they were never there. It’s a simple plan: coarse to fine, feather the old paint, level the filler, bury the scratches. Yet if you’ve ever lost the plot mid-sand—loading discs in minutes, burning through edges, or chasing mysterious swirl marks—you know grit choice and workflow make or break the job.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/26.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/26/best-grits-for-automotive-sanding-discs-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/best-grits-for-automotive-sanding-discs-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/26/best-grits-for-automotive-sanding-discs-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/best-grits-for-automotive-sanding-discs-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/26/best-grits-for-automotive-sanding-discs-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/best-grits-for-automotive-sanding-discs-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/26/best-grits-for-automotive-sanding-discs-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/best-grits-for-automotive-sanding-discs-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/26/best-grits-for-automotive-sanding-discs-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/best-grits-for-automotive-sanding-discs-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/26/best-grits-for-automotive-sanding-discs-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/best-grits-for-automotive-sanding-discs-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/26/best-grits-for-automotive-sanding-discs-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/best-grits-for-automotive-sanding-discs-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/26/best-grits-for-automotive-sanding-discs-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/best-grits-for-automotive-sanding-discs-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/26/best-grits-for-automotive-sanding-discs-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/best-grits-for-automotive-sanding-discs-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/26/best-grits-for-automotive-sanding-discs-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/best-grits-for-automotive-sanding-discs-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/26/best-grits-for-automotive-sanding-discs-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/best-grits-for-automotive-sanding-discs-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/26/best-grits-for-automotive-sanding-discs-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/best-grits-for-automotive-sanding-discs-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Belt Sander Safety And Technique</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/26/belt-sander-safety-and-technique-sanding-belts/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/26/belt-sander-safety-and-technique-sanding-belts/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 26 Nov 2025 13:39:50 +0000</pubDate><category>Sanding Belts &amp; Machines</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-360</category><description>A practical guide to sanding belts, belt sander safety, smart setup, and precise techniques for clean, consistent results at the workbench.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="sanding-belts-and-belt-sander-safety-essentials"&gt;Sanding Belts and Belt Sander Safety Essentials&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a moment most makers know: you flick on the shop light before dawn, coffee warming your hands, and the room hums awake. The bench is still a little chaotic from the last session—pencils buried under shavings, the faint maple scent lingering, and a project that almost looks finished. Almost. You run your fingers over a tabletop and feel what the eye can’t see: a slight wave, a glue line sitting a hair proud, a corner that needs softening. The belt sander is there, steadfast, promising speed and control. It can erase hours of awkward hand sanding—but only if you guide it with care.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/24.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/26/belt-sander-safety-and-technique-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/belt-sander-safety-and-technique-sanding-belts.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/26/belt-sander-safety-and-technique-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/belt-sander-safety-and-technique-sanding-belts.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/26/belt-sander-safety-and-technique-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/belt-sander-safety-and-technique-sanding-belts.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/26/belt-sander-safety-and-technique-sanding-belts/cards/instagram/belt-sander-safety-and-technique-sanding-belts.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/26/belt-sander-safety-and-technique-sanding-belts/cards/instagram/belt-sander-safety-and-technique-sanding-belts.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/26/belt-sander-safety-and-technique-sanding-belts/cards/instagram/belt-sander-safety-and-technique-sanding-belts.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/26/belt-sander-safety-and-technique-sanding-belts/cards/pinterest/belt-sander-safety-and-technique-sanding-belts.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/26/belt-sander-safety-and-technique-sanding-belts/cards/pinterest/belt-sander-safety-and-technique-sanding-belts.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/26/belt-sander-safety-and-technique-sanding-belts/cards/pinterest/belt-sander-safety-and-technique-sanding-belts.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/26/belt-sander-safety-and-technique-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/belt-sander-safety-and-technique-sanding-belts.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/26/belt-sander-safety-and-technique-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/belt-sander-safety-and-technique-sanding-belts.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/26/belt-sander-safety-and-technique-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/belt-sander-safety-and-technique-sanding-belts.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Sponge Versus Paper On Curved Surfaces</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 15:39:58 +0000</pubDate><category>Sanding Sponges</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>grit progression</category><category>sanding block</category><category>dust control</category><description>Learn when a sanding sponge outperforms paper on curves.

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve ever stood in your garage at 9 p.m., holding a cup of coffee with one hand and a carved table leg with the other, you know the moment: the curve looks great until you touch it with the wrong abrasive. Flat spots appear, sharp lines soften, and suddenly the piece loses the crisp profile you loved. I’ve been there countless times—chair arms, bowl rims, crown molding returns—each one begging for finesse. The first time I switched from paper to a sanding sponge mid-project, it felt like I’d finally turned down the static and could hear the wood speaking again. The foam hugged the profile, didn’t dig in, and let me smooth without erasing detail.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/22.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge/cards/instagram/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge/cards/instagram/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge/cards/instagram/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge/cards/pinterest/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge/cards/pinterest/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge/cards/pinterest/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>13</readingTime></item><item><title>Wrap Sandpaper Correctly On A Block</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 14:51:04 +0000</pubDate><category>Sanding Blocks</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>sanding block</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>dry sanding</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Learn how to wrap sandpaper on a sanding block for flat, fast, scratch-free results.

&lt;p&gt;I still remember the first shelf I built for our entryway—a simple maple plank resting on two brackets, meant to hold keys and a couple of planters. The board came out of the planer with faint ripples; the chamfers were uneven; and the finish looked decent from six feet away but not when the morning light hit. I did what many DIYers do: grabbed a sheet of paper, wrapped it around a block haphazardly, and pushed until my fingers ached. The final surface was smooth-ish, but I had shallow waves and rounded corners that betrayed the lack of control. Only after I switched to a properly wrapped sanding block did the maple flatten, the scratch pattern tighten, and my edges stay crisp.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/20.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block/cards/facebook/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block/cards/facebook/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block/cards/facebook/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block/cards/instagram/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block/cards/instagram/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block/cards/instagram/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block/cards/facebook/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block/cards/facebook/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block/cards/facebook/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>13</readingTime></item><item><title>Avoid Rounding Edges During Detail Sanding</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/avoid-rounding-edges-during-detail-sanding-detail-sander-sheets/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/avoid-rounding-edges-during-detail-sanding-detail-sander-sheets/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 13:39:01 +0000</pubDate><category>Detail Sander Sheets</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>dust control</category><category>orbital sander</category><category>sanding block</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Keep edges crisp: pro techniques, sheet choices, and workflows to avoid rounding during detail sanding with precision abrasive control.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="how-to-avoid-rounding-edges-with-detail-sander-sheets"&gt;How to Avoid Rounding Edges with Detail Sander Sheets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A crisp edge is honesty you can feel. You run a fingertip along the rail of a cabinet door or the rim of a keepsake box and know immediately whether the prep was careful or hurried. The line should be true—straight, sharp, and confident—not washed out by a power sander that wobbled a hair too long at the corner. The irony is familiar: we reach for a small triangular sander to finesse tight spaces, then watch it soften what we wanted to preserve. If you’ve ever started a job with a fresh pack of detail sander sheets, only to end it with unintentionally eased profiles, this guide is for you.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/18.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/avoid-rounding-edges-during-detail-sanding-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/avoid-rounding-edges-during-detail-sanding-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/avoid-rounding-edges-during-detail-sanding-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/avoid-rounding-edges-during-detail-sanding-detail-sander-sheets.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/avoid-rounding-edges-during-detail-sanding-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/avoid-rounding-edges-during-detail-sanding-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/avoid-rounding-edges-during-detail-sanding-detail-sander-sheets/cards/instagram/avoid-rounding-edges-during-detail-sanding-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/avoid-rounding-edges-during-detail-sanding-detail-sander-sheets/cards/instagram/avoid-rounding-edges-during-detail-sanding-detail-sander-sheets.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/avoid-rounding-edges-during-detail-sanding-detail-sander-sheets/cards/instagram/avoid-rounding-edges-during-detail-sanding-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/avoid-rounding-edges-during-detail-sanding-detail-sander-sheets/cards/pinterest/avoid-rounding-edges-during-detail-sanding-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/avoid-rounding-edges-during-detail-sanding-detail-sander-sheets/cards/pinterest/avoid-rounding-edges-during-detail-sanding-detail-sander-sheets.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/avoid-rounding-edges-during-detail-sanding-detail-sander-sheets/cards/pinterest/avoid-rounding-edges-during-detail-sanding-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/avoid-rounding-edges-during-detail-sanding-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/avoid-rounding-edges-during-detail-sanding-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/avoid-rounding-edges-during-detail-sanding-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/avoid-rounding-edges-during-detail-sanding-detail-sander-sheets.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/avoid-rounding-edges-during-detail-sanding-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/avoid-rounding-edges-during-detail-sanding-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Best Interface Pad For Curved Surfaces</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 18:06:15 +0000</pubDate><category>Random Orbital Sanding</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>Learn how to choose the best interface pad for curved surfaces and master random orbital sanding for cleaner contours, fewer swirls, and better control.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="best-interface-pads-for-curves-in-random-orbital-sanding"&gt;Best Interface Pads for Curves in Random Orbital Sanding&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You notice it the moment you run your hand across a curved armrest you’ve just sanded: the shape is smoother, yet somehow flatter than you hoped. The ridge that gave the piece personality has softened a little too much; the transition from convex to concave feels vague. You step back, eyes scanning for the culprit, and there it is—tiny half-moons glinting in the light. Swirl marks. Anyone who’s tried to sand a contoured chair leg, a guitar body, a carved cabinet door, or even a rounded countertop edge has felt this mix of pride and frustration. You’ve done the hard work of shaping. Now the surface needs finesse without losing its curves.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/16.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding/cards/instagram/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding/cards/instagram/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding/cards/instagram/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding/cards/pinterest/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding/cards/pinterest/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding/cards/pinterest/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Best Polishing Sequence After Wet Sanding</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-polishing-sequence-after-wet-sanding-polishing-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-polishing-sequence-after-wet-sanding-polishing-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 16:16:32 +0000</pubDate><category>Polishing &amp; Finishing</category><category>mirror finish</category><category>polishing pads</category><category>grit progression</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>clear coat</category><description>Learn the best polishing sequence after wet sanding.

&lt;p&gt;Picture this: late Saturday, lights humming in the garage, a quiet radio in the background, and the last sheet of wet/dry in your hand. The clear coat is dead-flat from your final passes, but it looks dull and grey—like all the gloss vanished. You run a finger across the panel and the surface feels flawless, almost sticky-smooth. That’s the moment when most DIYers wonder, “Now what?” The answer is a deliberate polishing sequence—and the right polishing sandpaper setup before you even plug in the machine. Whether you’re chasing a mirror finish on a freshly sprayed fender, a varnished guitar body, or a gelcoat corner on a boat hatch, what happens next determines whether you get a show-car sheen or a halo of haze.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/14.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-polishing-sequence-after-wet-sanding-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/best-polishing-sequence-after-wet-sanding-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-polishing-sequence-after-wet-sanding-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/best-polishing-sequence-after-wet-sanding-polishing-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-polishing-sequence-after-wet-sanding-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/best-polishing-sequence-after-wet-sanding-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-polishing-sequence-after-wet-sanding-polishing-sandpaper/cards/instagram/best-polishing-sequence-after-wet-sanding-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-polishing-sequence-after-wet-sanding-polishing-sandpaper/cards/instagram/best-polishing-sequence-after-wet-sanding-polishing-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-polishing-sequence-after-wet-sanding-polishing-sandpaper/cards/instagram/best-polishing-sequence-after-wet-sanding-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-polishing-sequence-after-wet-sanding-polishing-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/best-polishing-sequence-after-wet-sanding-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-polishing-sequence-after-wet-sanding-polishing-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/best-polishing-sequence-after-wet-sanding-polishing-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-polishing-sequence-after-wet-sanding-polishing-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/best-polishing-sequence-after-wet-sanding-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-polishing-sequence-after-wet-sanding-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/best-polishing-sequence-after-wet-sanding-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-polishing-sequence-after-wet-sanding-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/best-polishing-sequence-after-wet-sanding-polishing-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-polishing-sequence-after-wet-sanding-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/best-polishing-sequence-after-wet-sanding-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Light Sanding To Improve Adhesion Between Coats</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 14:39:05 +0000</pubDate><category>Between-Coats Sanding</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>dust control</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>Engineer’s guide to between coats sanding for stronger adhesion, right grits, abrasives, and timing.

&lt;p&gt;The first coat looked flawless under the shop lights. A fresh panel of maple, sealed in gloss, catching reflections like glass. Then morning sunlight cut through the window and told the truth: a constellation of dust nibs and a few faint brush marks the light had spared me the night before. If you’ve been there, you also know the impulse—grab more finish and try to bury the flaws. That almost always backfires. The next coat telegraphs the defects and, worse, may not bond optimally. That’s where the simple ritual of between coats sanding changes everything, not as a punishment, but as an engineering control.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/12.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding/cards/instagram/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding/cards/instagram/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding/cards/instagram/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding/cards/pinterest/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding/cards/pinterest/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding/cards/pinterest/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>When To Choose Chemical Stripping Instead Of Sanding</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 13:38:25 +0000</pubDate><category>Paint Removal &amp; Surface Prep</category><category>paint prep</category><category>rust removal</category><category>primer coat</category><category>sanding block</category><category>orbital sander</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Learn when chemical stripping beats sanding.

&lt;p&gt;You can hear a project before you see it: the whine of an orbital sander, the hiss of a dust extractor, the rasp of grit carving tracks in an old finish. The other soundtrack is a quiet shop, drop cloths taped down, a gelled stripper turning tired paint into ribbons under a plastic scraper. Both are valid approaches to surface preparation, and the results hinge on choosing the right path at the outset. The paint stripping vs sanding decision is less about preference and more about material science, coating behavior, and the downstream finish you expect. If you’re staring at a five-layer porch rail, a veneered dresser, or a fiberglass hatch, the fastest route to a clean, profile-ready surface may not be the one you think.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/10.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding/cards/instagram/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding/cards/instagram/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding/cards/instagram/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding/cards/pinterest/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding/cards/pinterest/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding/cards/pinterest/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Choose Tripoli Versus White Rouge For Metal Polishing</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/choose-tripoli-versus-white-rouge-for-metal-polishing-metal-polishing/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/choose-tripoli-versus-white-rouge-for-metal-polishing-metal-polishing/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 23 Nov 2025 13:58:51 +0000</pubDate><category>Metal Polishing &amp; Rust Repair</category><category>grit-1200</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>metal polishing</category><description>Understand Tripoli vs white rouge, choose the right wheel, and build a fast, safe metal polishing workflow for aluminum, brass, and steel.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="tripoli-vs-white-rouge-metal-polishing-guide"&gt;Tripoli vs White Rouge: Metal Polishing Guide&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday light pours across your workbench. The brass cabinet pulls you removed last night look dull, like they’ve filed away years of handprints and turned them matte. Nearby, the stainless kettle you use every morning is fine but not pristine—tiny swirls catch the sun. You set out the tools you have: a bench grinder with buffing wheels, two mystery compound bars—one brown, one white—and a quiet hope that today’s the day your pieces go from “cleaned up” to truly gleaming. If you’ve ever stood in this exact moment, ready to begin but unsure which bar to reach for, you’re not alone. Metal polishing is both craft and sequence, and the right choice at the right time matters.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/08.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/choose-tripoli-versus-white-rouge-for-metal-polishing-metal-polishing/cards/facebook/choose-tripoli-versus-white-rouge-for-metal-polishing-metal-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/choose-tripoli-versus-white-rouge-for-metal-polishing-metal-polishing/cards/facebook/choose-tripoli-versus-white-rouge-for-metal-polishing-metal-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/choose-tripoli-versus-white-rouge-for-metal-polishing-metal-polishing/cards/facebook/choose-tripoli-versus-white-rouge-for-metal-polishing-metal-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/choose-tripoli-versus-white-rouge-for-metal-polishing-metal-polishing/cards/instagram/choose-tripoli-versus-white-rouge-for-metal-polishing-metal-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/choose-tripoli-versus-white-rouge-for-metal-polishing-metal-polishing/cards/instagram/choose-tripoli-versus-white-rouge-for-metal-polishing-metal-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/choose-tripoli-versus-white-rouge-for-metal-polishing-metal-polishing/cards/instagram/choose-tripoli-versus-white-rouge-for-metal-polishing-metal-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/choose-tripoli-versus-white-rouge-for-metal-polishing-metal-polishing/cards/pinterest/choose-tripoli-versus-white-rouge-for-metal-polishing-metal-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/choose-tripoli-versus-white-rouge-for-metal-polishing-metal-polishing/cards/pinterest/choose-tripoli-versus-white-rouge-for-metal-polishing-metal-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/choose-tripoli-versus-white-rouge-for-metal-polishing-metal-polishing/cards/pinterest/choose-tripoli-versus-white-rouge-for-metal-polishing-metal-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/choose-tripoli-versus-white-rouge-for-metal-polishing-metal-polishing/cards/facebook/choose-tripoli-versus-white-rouge-for-metal-polishing-metal-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/choose-tripoli-versus-white-rouge-for-metal-polishing-metal-polishing/cards/facebook/choose-tripoli-versus-white-rouge-for-metal-polishing-metal-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/choose-tripoli-versus-white-rouge-for-metal-polishing-metal-polishing/cards/facebook/choose-tripoli-versus-white-rouge-for-metal-polishing-metal-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Why Uv Protective Clear Coat Is Required After Restoration</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 23 Nov 2025 13:28:43 +0000</pubDate><category>Headlight Restoration</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>clear coat</category><category>wet sanding</category><description>Discover why a UV clear coat is vital after restoration.

&lt;p&gt;You know that moment when the shop door rolls up, the morning light hits your freshly restored project, and you catch the reflection—crisp, glassy, and clean? Whether it’s a set of previously cloudy headlights, an oxidized hood you’ve cut and polished, or a faded motorcycle fairing you’ve brought back to life, it feels like breathing new air. I’ve been there on a Saturday morning, rag in one hand, inspection light in the other, admiring that deep clarity. It’s the quiet pride of a job well done. But here’s the tough-love truth: without a UV clear coat to seal that clarity, the sun will start undoing your work the second you roll outside.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/06.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat/cards/facebook/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat/cards/facebook/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat/cards/facebook/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat/cards/instagram/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat/cards/instagram/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat/cards/instagram/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat/cards/pinterest/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat/cards/pinterest/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat/cards/pinterest/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat/cards/facebook/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat/cards/facebook/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat/cards/facebook/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Full Orange Peel Removal Versus Texture Match To Oem Finish</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/full-orange-peel-removal-versus-texture-match-to-oem-finish-orange-peel-removal/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/full-orange-peel-removal-versus-texture-match-to-oem-finish-orange-peel-removal/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 22 Nov 2025 13:28:52 +0000</pubDate><category>Wet Sanding Clear Coat</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Engineer-tested guide comparing full orange peel removal to OEM texture matching, with measurements, workflows, and tool recommendations.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="orange-peel-removal-vs-oem-texture-match"&gt;Orange Peel Removal vs OEM Texture Match&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You notice it every time the sun breaks through the carport: the hood looks like a clear lake ruffled by a breeze. Not scratched, not dirty—just textured. You run your fingertips across it and feel… nothing. The gloss is there, the reflections are bright, but the lines of your neighbor’s fence warp and shimmer. That’s orange peel. It’s a finish most modern cars ship with on purpose—partly the byproduct of efficient high-solids clearcoats and fast robotic spray passes, partly an aesthetic choice that many automakers prefer for its way of masking minor defects and giving panels a sort of visual “softness.”&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/04.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/full-orange-peel-removal-versus-texture-match-to-oem-finish-orange-peel-removal/cards/facebook/full-orange-peel-removal-versus-texture-match-to-oem-finish-orange-peel-removal.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/full-orange-peel-removal-versus-texture-match-to-oem-finish-orange-peel-removal/cards/facebook/full-orange-peel-removal-versus-texture-match-to-oem-finish-orange-peel-removal.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/full-orange-peel-removal-versus-texture-match-to-oem-finish-orange-peel-removal/cards/facebook/full-orange-peel-removal-versus-texture-match-to-oem-finish-orange-peel-removal.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/full-orange-peel-removal-versus-texture-match-to-oem-finish-orange-peel-removal/cards/instagram/full-orange-peel-removal-versus-texture-match-to-oem-finish-orange-peel-removal.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/full-orange-peel-removal-versus-texture-match-to-oem-finish-orange-peel-removal/cards/instagram/full-orange-peel-removal-versus-texture-match-to-oem-finish-orange-peel-removal.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/full-orange-peel-removal-versus-texture-match-to-oem-finish-orange-peel-removal/cards/instagram/full-orange-peel-removal-versus-texture-match-to-oem-finish-orange-peel-removal.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/full-orange-peel-removal-versus-texture-match-to-oem-finish-orange-peel-removal/cards/pinterest/full-orange-peel-removal-versus-texture-match-to-oem-finish-orange-peel-removal.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/full-orange-peel-removal-versus-texture-match-to-oem-finish-orange-peel-removal/cards/pinterest/full-orange-peel-removal-versus-texture-match-to-oem-finish-orange-peel-removal.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/full-orange-peel-removal-versus-texture-match-to-oem-finish-orange-peel-removal/cards/pinterest/full-orange-peel-removal-versus-texture-match-to-oem-finish-orange-peel-removal.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/full-orange-peel-removal-versus-texture-match-to-oem-finish-orange-peel-removal/cards/facebook/full-orange-peel-removal-versus-texture-match-to-oem-finish-orange-peel-removal.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/full-orange-peel-removal-versus-texture-match-to-oem-finish-orange-peel-removal/cards/facebook/full-orange-peel-removal-versus-texture-match-to-oem-finish-orange-peel-removal.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/full-orange-peel-removal-versus-texture-match-to-oem-finish-orange-peel-removal/cards/facebook/full-orange-peel-removal-versus-texture-match-to-oem-finish-orange-peel-removal.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Block Sanding Techniques To Straighten Wavy Panels</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/block-sanding-techniques-to-straighten-wavy-panels-block-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/block-sanding-techniques-to-straighten-wavy-panels-block-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 22 Nov 2025 00:39:32 +0000</pubDate><category>Auto Body Sanding</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit progression</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>mirror finish</category><description>Master block sanding to straighten wavy panels.

&lt;p&gt;The first time you notice the wave is rarely under shop fluorescents. It’s usually on a quiet evening, when the sun sits low and your freshly primed quarter panel mirrors a rippling skyline instead of a straight horizon. You run a hand over the surface—smooth, no pinholes, no obvious highs—yet the reflection trembles as if it remembers every hammer blow. That’s the moment every builder meets the truth: paint doesn’t hide shape. Only block sanding, done methodically with the right abrasives, pressure, and board geometry, can translate good bodywork into panels that read as laser-straight in unforgiving light.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/02.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/block-sanding-techniques-to-straighten-wavy-panels-block-sanding/cards/facebook/block-sanding-techniques-to-straighten-wavy-panels-block-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/block-sanding-techniques-to-straighten-wavy-panels-block-sanding/cards/facebook/block-sanding-techniques-to-straighten-wavy-panels-block-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/block-sanding-techniques-to-straighten-wavy-panels-block-sanding/cards/facebook/block-sanding-techniques-to-straighten-wavy-panels-block-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/block-sanding-techniques-to-straighten-wavy-panels-block-sanding/cards/instagram/block-sanding-techniques-to-straighten-wavy-panels-block-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/block-sanding-techniques-to-straighten-wavy-panels-block-sanding/cards/instagram/block-sanding-techniques-to-straighten-wavy-panels-block-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/block-sanding-techniques-to-straighten-wavy-panels-block-sanding/cards/instagram/block-sanding-techniques-to-straighten-wavy-panels-block-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/block-sanding-techniques-to-straighten-wavy-panels-block-sanding/cards/pinterest/block-sanding-techniques-to-straighten-wavy-panels-block-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/block-sanding-techniques-to-straighten-wavy-panels-block-sanding/cards/pinterest/block-sanding-techniques-to-straighten-wavy-panels-block-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/block-sanding-techniques-to-straighten-wavy-panels-block-sanding/cards/pinterest/block-sanding-techniques-to-straighten-wavy-panels-block-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/block-sanding-techniques-to-straighten-wavy-panels-block-sanding/cards/facebook/block-sanding-techniques-to-straighten-wavy-panels-block-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/block-sanding-techniques-to-straighten-wavy-panels-block-sanding/cards/facebook/block-sanding-techniques-to-straighten-wavy-panels-block-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/block-sanding-techniques-to-straighten-wavy-panels-block-sanding/cards/facebook/block-sanding-techniques-to-straighten-wavy-panels-block-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>How To Use A Drum Sander Without Gouging The Floor</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/how-to-use-a-drum-sander-without-gouging-the-floor-drum-sander/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/how-to-use-a-drum-sander-without-gouging-the-floor-drum-sander/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 22 Nov 2025 00:17:02 +0000</pubDate><category>Floor &amp; Deck Sanding</category><category>grit-40</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>dust control</category><category>dry sanding</category><category>orbital sander</category><description>Learn how to use a drum sander safely and smoothly to refinish hardwood floors without gouges, from setup and technique to edges, dust, and final prep.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="how-to-use-a-drum-sander-without-gouging-floors"&gt;How to Use a Drum Sander Without Gouging Floors&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a specific quiet that fills the house once the furniture is moved and the rugs are rolled away. You stand in that new emptiness and see every scuff and dent that daily life has pressed into your hardwood—sun-faded planks by the windows, chair-leg tracks under the table, and a dark, worn path that arcs toward the kitchen. Maybe you’ve watched a few videos and read some forum threads, and now the rental center’s phone number is staring you down. The idea of a sparkling new finish is thrilling. The idea of gouging the floor with a poorly handled drum sander? Not so much.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/29.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/how-to-use-a-drum-sander-without-gouging-the-floor-drum-sander/cards/facebook/how-to-use-a-drum-sander-without-gouging-the-floor-drum-sander.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/how-to-use-a-drum-sander-without-gouging-the-floor-drum-sander/cards/facebook/how-to-use-a-drum-sander-without-gouging-the-floor-drum-sander.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/how-to-use-a-drum-sander-without-gouging-the-floor-drum-sander/cards/facebook/how-to-use-a-drum-sander-without-gouging-the-floor-drum-sander.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/how-to-use-a-drum-sander-without-gouging-the-floor-drum-sander/cards/instagram/how-to-use-a-drum-sander-without-gouging-the-floor-drum-sander.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/how-to-use-a-drum-sander-without-gouging-the-floor-drum-sander/cards/instagram/how-to-use-a-drum-sander-without-gouging-the-floor-drum-sander.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/how-to-use-a-drum-sander-without-gouging-the-floor-drum-sander/cards/instagram/how-to-use-a-drum-sander-without-gouging-the-floor-drum-sander.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/how-to-use-a-drum-sander-without-gouging-the-floor-drum-sander/cards/pinterest/how-to-use-a-drum-sander-without-gouging-the-floor-drum-sander.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/how-to-use-a-drum-sander-without-gouging-the-floor-drum-sander/cards/pinterest/how-to-use-a-drum-sander-without-gouging-the-floor-drum-sander.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/how-to-use-a-drum-sander-without-gouging-the-floor-drum-sander/cards/pinterest/how-to-use-a-drum-sander-without-gouging-the-floor-drum-sander.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/how-to-use-a-drum-sander-without-gouging-the-floor-drum-sander/cards/facebook/how-to-use-a-drum-sander-without-gouging-the-floor-drum-sander.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/how-to-use-a-drum-sander-without-gouging-the-floor-drum-sander/cards/facebook/how-to-use-a-drum-sander-without-gouging-the-floor-drum-sander.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/how-to-use-a-drum-sander-without-gouging-the-floor-drum-sander/cards/facebook/how-to-use-a-drum-sander-without-gouging-the-floor-drum-sander.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>13</readingTime></item><item><title>Set Up Dustless Drywall Sanding With Shop Vac</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/set-up-dustless-drywall-sanding-with-shop-vac-dustless-drywall-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/set-up-dustless-drywall-sanding-with-shop-vac-dustless-drywall-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 21 Nov 2025 16:22:15 +0000</pubDate><category>Drywall Sanding</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-220</category><category>dust control</category><description>Learn how to set up dustless drywall sanding with a shop vac for cleaner, faster results.

&lt;p&gt;I’ve walked into more living rooms covered in drywall dust than I care to admit. It’s in the couch seams, the AC returns, your morning coffee—everywhere. You think you’ll “just scuff the patches,” then the sun hits the air like a stage light and there it is: a snow globe from floor to ceiling. I’ve been there—rushed deadlines, fresh paint booked for tomorrow, and a client who can’t breathe if dust drifts beyond the plastic. That’s why I preach dust control like it’s a religion, especially when we’re sanding drywall. With a proper setup for dustless drywall sanding using a shop vac, you don’t just keep the room livable—you work faster, see your surface better, and stop clogging your lungs and your vacuum.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/27.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/set-up-dustless-drywall-sanding-with-shop-vac-dustless-drywall-sanding/cards/facebook/set-up-dustless-drywall-sanding-with-shop-vac-dustless-drywall-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/set-up-dustless-drywall-sanding-with-shop-vac-dustless-drywall-sanding/cards/facebook/set-up-dustless-drywall-sanding-with-shop-vac-dustless-drywall-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/set-up-dustless-drywall-sanding-with-shop-vac-dustless-drywall-sanding/cards/facebook/set-up-dustless-drywall-sanding-with-shop-vac-dustless-drywall-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/set-up-dustless-drywall-sanding-with-shop-vac-dustless-drywall-sanding/cards/instagram/set-up-dustless-drywall-sanding-with-shop-vac-dustless-drywall-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/set-up-dustless-drywall-sanding-with-shop-vac-dustless-drywall-sanding/cards/instagram/set-up-dustless-drywall-sanding-with-shop-vac-dustless-drywall-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/set-up-dustless-drywall-sanding-with-shop-vac-dustless-drywall-sanding/cards/instagram/set-up-dustless-drywall-sanding-with-shop-vac-dustless-drywall-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/set-up-dustless-drywall-sanding-with-shop-vac-dustless-drywall-sanding/cards/pinterest/set-up-dustless-drywall-sanding-with-shop-vac-dustless-drywall-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/set-up-dustless-drywall-sanding-with-shop-vac-dustless-drywall-sanding/cards/pinterest/set-up-dustless-drywall-sanding-with-shop-vac-dustless-drywall-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/set-up-dustless-drywall-sanding-with-shop-vac-dustless-drywall-sanding/cards/pinterest/set-up-dustless-drywall-sanding-with-shop-vac-dustless-drywall-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/set-up-dustless-drywall-sanding-with-shop-vac-dustless-drywall-sanding/cards/facebook/set-up-dustless-drywall-sanding-with-shop-vac-dustless-drywall-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/set-up-dustless-drywall-sanding-with-shop-vac-dustless-drywall-sanding/cards/facebook/set-up-dustless-drywall-sanding-with-shop-vac-dustless-drywall-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/set-up-dustless-drywall-sanding-with-shop-vac-dustless-drywall-sanding/cards/facebook/set-up-dustless-drywall-sanding-with-shop-vac-dustless-drywall-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>13</readingTime></item><item><title>How To Sand Detailed Trim Profiles Without Rounding Over</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 21 Nov 2025 14:57:21 +0000</pubDate><category>Trim &amp; Molding Sanding</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>dust control</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Engineer-tested methods for profile sanding detailed trim without rounding edges.

&lt;p&gt;A Saturday morning, coffee cooling on the bench, I’m staring at a stretch of 1920s casing that’s seen one too many paint jobs and a hard century of sun. The ogee still reads elegant from across the room, but up close the quirk line is softened and the fillet is barely a suggestion. I know the story because I’ve helped write versions of it: strip, sand, repaint — and somehow every pass with paper steals the edges that make the molding sing. The fear of rounding is why many pros dread profile sanding. It’s not the effort; it’s the risk of flattening crisp geometry that took a knife or cutter just seconds to define.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/25.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding/cards/instagram/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding/cards/instagram/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding/cards/instagram/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>How To Apply Grain Filler On Open Pore Woods Like Oak</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 21 Nov 2025 13:33:23 +0000</pubDate><category>Furniture Refinishing</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>orbital sander</category><description>Learn precise grain filling for oak: abrasives, sanding workflow, filler selection, and application to achieve a glass-smooth finish on open-pore woods.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="grain-filling-oak-pro-sanding-and-filler-workflow"&gt;Grain Filling Oak: Pro Sanding and Filler Workflow&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a moment every woodworker recognizes: fingertips tracing a new oak tabletop, catching on the earlywood valleys that step across the surface like tiny terraces. Under shop lights, the finish looks glossy, almost perfect—until the raking light at sunrise reveals a topography of pores telegraphing through the film. That’s when grain filling stops being a nice-to-have and becomes a requirement. On open-pore woods like oak, ash, and mahogany, achieving a piano-flat finish asks for a deliberate sequence: correct abrasive selection, controlled scratch management, filler chemistry that matches your topcoat, and disciplined leveling. Skip any step and the pores will betray your shortcuts weeks later.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/23.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling/cards/facebook/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling/cards/facebook/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling/cards/facebook/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling/cards/instagram/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling/cards/instagram/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling/cards/instagram/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling/cards/pinterest/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling/cards/pinterest/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling/cards/pinterest/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling/cards/facebook/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling/cards/facebook/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling/cards/facebook/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Recommended Grit Progression For Bare Wood Projects</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/recommended-grit-progression-for-bare-wood-projects-grit-progression/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/recommended-grit-progression-for-bare-wood-projects-grit-progression/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 21 Nov 2025 03:27:43 +0000</pubDate><category>Wood sanding</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit progression</category><category>clear coat</category><description>Learn the best grit progression for bare wood.

&lt;p&gt;The shop is quiet except for the low thrum of the dust collector warming up. A mug of coffee cools on the bench while you run your fingertips across a fresh board—straight from the planer, faint ridges under the grain. Last time, you started too fine and paid for it with stubborn tear-out lines that only became visible after stain. This time you want a better plan. You want a clear grit progression that fits the wood, the project, and the finish you’ve chosen.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/21.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/recommended-grit-progression-for-bare-wood-projects-grit-progression/cards/facebook/recommended-grit-progression-for-bare-wood-projects-grit-progression.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/recommended-grit-progression-for-bare-wood-projects-grit-progression/cards/facebook/recommended-grit-progression-for-bare-wood-projects-grit-progression.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/recommended-grit-progression-for-bare-wood-projects-grit-progression/cards/facebook/recommended-grit-progression-for-bare-wood-projects-grit-progression.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/recommended-grit-progression-for-bare-wood-projects-grit-progression/cards/instagram/recommended-grit-progression-for-bare-wood-projects-grit-progression.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/recommended-grit-progression-for-bare-wood-projects-grit-progression/cards/instagram/recommended-grit-progression-for-bare-wood-projects-grit-progression.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/recommended-grit-progression-for-bare-wood-projects-grit-progression/cards/instagram/recommended-grit-progression-for-bare-wood-projects-grit-progression.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/recommended-grit-progression-for-bare-wood-projects-grit-progression/cards/pinterest/recommended-grit-progression-for-bare-wood-projects-grit-progression.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/recommended-grit-progression-for-bare-wood-projects-grit-progression/cards/pinterest/recommended-grit-progression-for-bare-wood-projects-grit-progression.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/recommended-grit-progression-for-bare-wood-projects-grit-progression/cards/pinterest/recommended-grit-progression-for-bare-wood-projects-grit-progression.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/recommended-grit-progression-for-bare-wood-projects-grit-progression/cards/facebook/recommended-grit-progression-for-bare-wood-projects-grit-progression.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/recommended-grit-progression-for-bare-wood-projects-grit-progression/cards/facebook/recommended-grit-progression-for-bare-wood-projects-grit-progression.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/recommended-grit-progression-for-bare-wood-projects-grit-progression/cards/facebook/recommended-grit-progression-for-bare-wood-projects-grit-progression.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Compare Scratch Depth At Equal Grits</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/compare-scratch-depth-at-equal-grits-abrasive-testing/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/compare-scratch-depth-at-equal-grits-abrasive-testing/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 21 Nov 2025 02:06:34 +0000</pubDate><category>Abrasive Innovation &amp; Testing</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-220</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>sanding block</category><description>Learn how to compare scratch depth at equal grits with practical abrasive testing, real workshop steps, and pro tips for wood, metal, and composites.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="abrasive-testing-compare-scratch-depth-at-equal-grits"&gt;Abrasive Testing: Compare Scratch Depth at Equal Grits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It starts the same way in every shop: coffee cooling on the bench, clamp marks still fresh on yesterday’s glue-up, and a stack of sandpaper cut into tidy quarters. You grab two sheets—both labeled 220 grit—because today you’re chasing a clean, consistent surface on a walnut tabletop that deserves better than swirl marks. Ten strokes in, the sheen looks different between sheets. You can feel it with your fingertips too—one side looks hazier, slightly more torn up, and the grain lines pop in a way that screams “deeper scratches.” Both sheets claim the same grit number, so why the mismatch? That’s the kind of moment that sends me down the rabbit hole of abrasive testing.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/19.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/compare-scratch-depth-at-equal-grits-abrasive-testing/cards/facebook/compare-scratch-depth-at-equal-grits-abrasive-testing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/compare-scratch-depth-at-equal-grits-abrasive-testing/cards/facebook/compare-scratch-depth-at-equal-grits-abrasive-testing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/compare-scratch-depth-at-equal-grits-abrasive-testing/cards/facebook/compare-scratch-depth-at-equal-grits-abrasive-testing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/compare-scratch-depth-at-equal-grits-abrasive-testing/cards/instagram/compare-scratch-depth-at-equal-grits-abrasive-testing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/compare-scratch-depth-at-equal-grits-abrasive-testing/cards/instagram/compare-scratch-depth-at-equal-grits-abrasive-testing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/compare-scratch-depth-at-equal-grits-abrasive-testing/cards/instagram/compare-scratch-depth-at-equal-grits-abrasive-testing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/compare-scratch-depth-at-equal-grits-abrasive-testing/cards/pinterest/compare-scratch-depth-at-equal-grits-abrasive-testing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/compare-scratch-depth-at-equal-grits-abrasive-testing/cards/pinterest/compare-scratch-depth-at-equal-grits-abrasive-testing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/compare-scratch-depth-at-equal-grits-abrasive-testing/cards/pinterest/compare-scratch-depth-at-equal-grits-abrasive-testing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/compare-scratch-depth-at-equal-grits-abrasive-testing/cards/facebook/compare-scratch-depth-at-equal-grits-abrasive-testing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/compare-scratch-depth-at-equal-grits-abrasive-testing/cards/facebook/compare-scratch-depth-at-equal-grits-abrasive-testing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/compare-scratch-depth-at-equal-grits-abrasive-testing/cards/facebook/compare-scratch-depth-at-equal-grits-abrasive-testing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Hand Sanding Versus Power Sanding Comparison</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/hand-sanding-versus-power-sanding-comparison-hand-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/hand-sanding-versus-power-sanding-comparison-hand-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2025 16:50:43 +0000</pubDate><category>Hand Sanding Techniques</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Engineer’s comparison of hand sanding and power sanding: surface finish, speed, dust, cost, and workflow tips for wood, metal, and paint.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="hand-sanding-vs-power-sanding-an-engineers-guide"&gt;Hand sanding vs power sanding: an engineer’s guide&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a point in every restoration or build where the project stops looking like a collection of parts and starts feeling like an object with a future. For me, it’s the first moment the surface turns uniformly matte under the light. That’s usually after the first disciplined pass of hand sanding. The radio is low, dust extraction hums in the background, and the world reduces to the consistent rhythm of the block. Compare that to the blunt urgency of a random-orbit sander—faster, louder, and undeniably effective. Both have their place. When you’re staring at a hardwood tabletop with coffee rings and cross-grain scratches, or a steel bracket that needs a satin finish without rounding its crisp edges, the choice between manual strokes and powered oscillations is more than preference; it’s a process decision that dictates speed, quality, and cost.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/17.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/hand-sanding-versus-power-sanding-comparison-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/hand-sanding-versus-power-sanding-comparison-hand-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/hand-sanding-versus-power-sanding-comparison-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/hand-sanding-versus-power-sanding-comparison-hand-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/hand-sanding-versus-power-sanding-comparison-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/hand-sanding-versus-power-sanding-comparison-hand-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/hand-sanding-versus-power-sanding-comparison-hand-sanding/cards/instagram/hand-sanding-versus-power-sanding-comparison-hand-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/hand-sanding-versus-power-sanding-comparison-hand-sanding/cards/instagram/hand-sanding-versus-power-sanding-comparison-hand-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/hand-sanding-versus-power-sanding-comparison-hand-sanding/cards/instagram/hand-sanding-versus-power-sanding-comparison-hand-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/hand-sanding-versus-power-sanding-comparison-hand-sanding/cards/pinterest/hand-sanding-versus-power-sanding-comparison-hand-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/hand-sanding-versus-power-sanding-comparison-hand-sanding/cards/pinterest/hand-sanding-versus-power-sanding-comparison-hand-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/hand-sanding-versus-power-sanding-comparison-hand-sanding/cards/pinterest/hand-sanding-versus-power-sanding-comparison-hand-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/hand-sanding-versus-power-sanding-comparison-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/hand-sanding-versus-power-sanding-comparison-hand-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/hand-sanding-versus-power-sanding-comparison-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/hand-sanding-versus-power-sanding-comparison-hand-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/hand-sanding-versus-power-sanding-comparison-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/hand-sanding-versus-power-sanding-comparison-hand-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Hepa Extraction And Respirator Guidance</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/hepa-extraction-and-respirator-guidance-eco-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/hepa-extraction-and-respirator-guidance-eco-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2025 15:29:07 +0000</pubDate><category>Eco &amp; Non-Toxic Abrasives</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Practical HEPA extraction and respirator guidance for sanding workflows, with eco sandpaper selection, fit testing, and lead-safe cleanup best practices.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="hepa-extraction-and-respirators-with-eco-sandpaper"&gt;HEPA Extraction and Respirators with eco sandpaper&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you spend your days refining surfaces, you know the moment: the room is quiet except for the steady hum of the sander, extraction hose draped over your shoulder, and the clean, consistent bite of the abrasive cutting only what it needs to. It’s a small sense of control in a messy world—measured in microns and minutes saved. The work is exacting and sometimes unforgiving, especially when the substrate is unknown or the coating dates back decades. That’s why the right system matters. From the abrasive itself—perhaps an eco sandpaper that reduces loading and waste—to the HEPA extractor and the respirator on your face, every component either drives precision or introduces risk.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/15.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/hepa-extraction-and-respirator-guidance-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/hepa-extraction-and-respirator-guidance-eco-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/hepa-extraction-and-respirator-guidance-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/hepa-extraction-and-respirator-guidance-eco-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/hepa-extraction-and-respirator-guidance-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/hepa-extraction-and-respirator-guidance-eco-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/hepa-extraction-and-respirator-guidance-eco-sandpaper/cards/instagram/hepa-extraction-and-respirator-guidance-eco-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/hepa-extraction-and-respirator-guidance-eco-sandpaper/cards/instagram/hepa-extraction-and-respirator-guidance-eco-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/hepa-extraction-and-respirator-guidance-eco-sandpaper/cards/instagram/hepa-extraction-and-respirator-guidance-eco-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/hepa-extraction-and-respirator-guidance-eco-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/hepa-extraction-and-respirator-guidance-eco-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/hepa-extraction-and-respirator-guidance-eco-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/hepa-extraction-and-respirator-guidance-eco-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/hepa-extraction-and-respirator-guidance-eco-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/hepa-extraction-and-respirator-guidance-eco-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/hepa-extraction-and-respirator-guidance-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/hepa-extraction-and-respirator-guidance-eco-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/hepa-extraction-and-respirator-guidance-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/hepa-extraction-and-respirator-guidance-eco-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/hepa-extraction-and-respirator-guidance-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/hepa-extraction-and-respirator-guidance-eco-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Loading Resistance Across Manufacturers</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/loading-resistance-across-manufacturers-best-sandpaper-brand/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/loading-resistance-across-manufacturers-best-sandpaper-brand/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2025 13:36:23 +0000</pubDate><category>Brand &amp; Quality Comparison</category><category>grit-150</category><category>joint compound</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Discover which sandpaper brands resist loading best and why—practical tests, materials science, and pro tips to keep abrasives cutting longer.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="best-sandpaper-brand-for-loading-resistance"&gt;Best sandpaper brand for loading resistance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’re halfway through Saturday’s project—smoothing a pine bookshelf you promised to refinish months ago—when your sanding disc turns from sharp to slick in minutes. Dust cakes into the grit, the paper glazes, and the sander begins to skate instead of cut. You press harder, it heats up, and tiny swirls appear where a clean, crisp surface should be. A fresh disc helps, but only briefly. At this point, it’s tempting to blame technique. In reality, loading (clogging) varies so much between manufacturers that choosing the best sandpaper brand can change the entire trajectory of your day.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/13.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/loading-resistance-across-manufacturers-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/facebook/loading-resistance-across-manufacturers-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/loading-resistance-across-manufacturers-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/facebook/loading-resistance-across-manufacturers-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/loading-resistance-across-manufacturers-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/facebook/loading-resistance-across-manufacturers-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/loading-resistance-across-manufacturers-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/instagram/loading-resistance-across-manufacturers-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/loading-resistance-across-manufacturers-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/instagram/loading-resistance-across-manufacturers-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/loading-resistance-across-manufacturers-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/instagram/loading-resistance-across-manufacturers-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/loading-resistance-across-manufacturers-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/pinterest/loading-resistance-across-manufacturers-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/loading-resistance-across-manufacturers-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/pinterest/loading-resistance-across-manufacturers-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/loading-resistance-across-manufacturers-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/pinterest/loading-resistance-across-manufacturers-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/loading-resistance-across-manufacturers-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/facebook/loading-resistance-across-manufacturers-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/loading-resistance-across-manufacturers-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/facebook/loading-resistance-across-manufacturers-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/loading-resistance-across-manufacturers-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/facebook/loading-resistance-across-manufacturers-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Paper Weight And Flexibility Differences</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/paper-weight-and-flexibility-differences-open-coat-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/paper-weight-and-flexibility-differences-open-coat-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2025 05:56:56 +0000</pubDate><category>Backing Types &amp; Coatings</category><category>grit-150</category><category>orbital sander</category><category>sanding block</category><category>grit progression</category><category>wet sanding</category><description>Understand paper weight, flexibility, and when to use open coat sandpaper for cleaner cuts, fewer clogs, and pro-grade finishes in wood and metalwork.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="open-coat-sandpaper-paper-weight-and-flexibility"&gt;Open Coat Sandpaper, Paper Weight, and Flexibility&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning, mug of coffee steaming on the bench. The shop is still cool, and the only sound is your block plane sliding across a maple board. You’re smoothing a reclaimed slab into a dining table that has to look heirloom, not “weekend project.” You switch to abrasive work—this is where most projects are won or lost. Pull a sheet from the drawer and you can tell instantly: too stiff and it will flatten the gentle chamfer you’ve planed; too flimsy and it will telegraph every ridge from your fingertips. You also know the species: maple burns if you let a clogged sheet skate across it. That’s where choice matters—paper weight, flexibility, and whether open coat sandpaper will let the dust clear instead of loading the sheet like wet snow on a shovel.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/11.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/paper-weight-and-flexibility-differences-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/paper-weight-and-flexibility-differences-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/paper-weight-and-flexibility-differences-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/paper-weight-and-flexibility-differences-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/paper-weight-and-flexibility-differences-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/paper-weight-and-flexibility-differences-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/paper-weight-and-flexibility-differences-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/instagram/paper-weight-and-flexibility-differences-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/paper-weight-and-flexibility-differences-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/instagram/paper-weight-and-flexibility-differences-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/paper-weight-and-flexibility-differences-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/instagram/paper-weight-and-flexibility-differences-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/paper-weight-and-flexibility-differences-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/paper-weight-and-flexibility-differences-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/paper-weight-and-flexibility-differences-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/paper-weight-and-flexibility-differences-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/paper-weight-and-flexibility-differences-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/paper-weight-and-flexibility-differences-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/paper-weight-and-flexibility-differences-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/paper-weight-and-flexibility-differences-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/paper-weight-and-flexibility-differences-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/paper-weight-and-flexibility-differences-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/paper-weight-and-flexibility-differences-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/paper-weight-and-flexibility-differences-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Cut Rate And Loading Behavior By Grain</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2025 00:57:05 +0000</pubDate><category>Abrasive Materials &amp; Compounds</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>clear coat</category><category>orbital sander</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>Engineer’s guide to silicon carbide sandpaper—cut rate, loading, grain physics, and practical tips to choose the right abrasive for paint, metal, and</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="silicon-carbide-sandpaper-cut-rate-and-loading"&gt;Silicon Carbide Sandpaper: Cut Rate and Loading&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning in the garage, the air smelled faintly of cut clear coat and soapy water. A half-finished motorcycle tank sat on a foam cradle, its orange peel and dust nibs highlighted by a raking LED panel. I’d already tried a few sheets of 1500 grit from a contractor pack, but they stalled after a few passes, loading with milky slurry and leaving stray scratches that would require more polish later. This is the moment that separates a casual sand from a dependable workflow—the point where abrasive choice dictates not just speed, but consistency and finish quality. Swapping to silicon carbide sandpaper felt like a small change, but it reset the process: faster leveling, more controllable scratch patterns, and fewer surprise defects.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/09.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/instagram/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/instagram/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/instagram/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Densifier Timing For Stronger Surface</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/densifier-timing-for-stronger-surface-concrete-polishing/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/densifier-timing-for-stronger-surface-concrete-polishing/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2025 15:46:00 +0000</pubDate><category>Stone &amp; Concrete Polishing</category><category>grit-40</category><category>grit-50</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-1000</category><description>Master densifier timing in concrete polishing to unlock higher hardness, gloss, and abrasion resistance with reliable, step-by-step workflow guidance.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="densifier-timing-for-stronger-concrete-polishing"&gt;Densifier Timing for Stronger Concrete Polishing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first time you walk across a newly polished shop floor, the sound underfoot tells you nearly everything: tight, crystalline, with no chalky whisper at your heel. A good concrete polish isn’t only about sheen; it’s the tactile confirmation that the surface has been chemically tightened and mechanically refined in harmony. Yet that harmony is fragile. If you’ve ever watched slurry smear instead of cutting, or seen a gloss peak early and then plateau—no matter how many passes—you’ve felt how unforgiving poor timing can be. The densifier you choose, and more importantly when you put it down, can either lock in a fine scratch pattern and raise surface hardness or entomb flaws and waste abrasive life.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/07.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/densifier-timing-for-stronger-surface-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/densifier-timing-for-stronger-surface-concrete-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/densifier-timing-for-stronger-surface-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/densifier-timing-for-stronger-surface-concrete-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/densifier-timing-for-stronger-surface-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/densifier-timing-for-stronger-surface-concrete-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/densifier-timing-for-stronger-surface-concrete-polishing/cards/instagram/densifier-timing-for-stronger-surface-concrete-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/densifier-timing-for-stronger-surface-concrete-polishing/cards/instagram/densifier-timing-for-stronger-surface-concrete-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/densifier-timing-for-stronger-surface-concrete-polishing/cards/instagram/densifier-timing-for-stronger-surface-concrete-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/densifier-timing-for-stronger-surface-concrete-polishing/cards/pinterest/densifier-timing-for-stronger-surface-concrete-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/densifier-timing-for-stronger-surface-concrete-polishing/cards/pinterest/densifier-timing-for-stronger-surface-concrete-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/densifier-timing-for-stronger-surface-concrete-polishing/cards/pinterest/densifier-timing-for-stronger-surface-concrete-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/densifier-timing-for-stronger-surface-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/densifier-timing-for-stronger-surface-concrete-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/densifier-timing-for-stronger-surface-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/densifier-timing-for-stronger-surface-concrete-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/densifier-timing-for-stronger-surface-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/densifier-timing-for-stronger-surface-concrete-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Grit Selection For Antifouling Paint Prep</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2025 14:20:36 +0000</pubDate><category>Marine Sanding</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-70</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-280</category><category>dust control</category><category>paint prep</category><category>orbital sander</category><description>Learn how to choose the right sanding grits for antifouling prep.

&lt;p&gt;You feel it as soon as the travel lift sets your boat on the stands: that mix of relief and responsibility. The hull looks taller on land, the waterline a faint stain of the season gone by. There’s a quiet rhythm to the boatyard in the early hours—compressors breathe, gulls trade commentary, coffee cools beside a bucket of scrapers. You run your hand over the bottom paint and feel the story of boat sanding before you even begin: the hard, glossy ridges where the sander skipped, the chalky patches that might be underbound, the thin spots the sea worked harder than you realized. It’s tempting to rush the job and get straight to brushing on antifouling. But prep is where the next season is won. Choosing the right grit is the difference between a coat that stays put and one that blisters, powders, or peels when the boat is back in her element.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/05.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding/cards/instagram/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding/cards/instagram/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding/cards/instagram/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding/cards/pinterest/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding/cards/pinterest/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding/cards/pinterest/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Keep Surfaces Wet To Control Heat</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2025 13:37:28 +0000</pubDate><category>Glass &amp; Ceramics Sanding</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-280</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-1200</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>Learn expert glass sanding techniques—why water matters, how to control heat, avoid cracks, and get a flawless edge with safe, practical workshop setups.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="glass-sanding-keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat"&gt;Glass Sanding: Keep Surfaces Wet to Control Heat&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know that afternoon light that hits your workshop just right—sawdust floating like golden confetti, the radio low, a mug ring etched into the bench? That’s where precision starts for me. I remember the first time I tried to smooth a chipped glass shelf salvaged from a vintage cabinet. I treated it like hardwood: dry paper, firm pressure, and a “let’s get this done” pace. Ten minutes in, the edge flashed white, my pad squealed, and the glass pinged with that terrifying, crystalline chatter. I learned fast: glass doesn’t forgive heat. It stores stress the way steel stores spring.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/03.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding/cards/instagram/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding/cards/instagram/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding/cards/instagram/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding/cards/pinterest/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding/cards/pinterest/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding/cards/pinterest/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Choose Pad And Compound For Plastics</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 13:37:22 +0000</pubDate><category>Resin Polishing</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>grit progression</category><category>sanding block</category><category>polishing pads</category><description>Engineer’s guide to resin polishing: pick the right pad and compound for acrylic, polycarbonate, and epoxy.

&lt;p&gt;On a quiet Saturday, I watched a friend slowly lower a buffing pad onto the cloudy edge of his epoxy river table. The coffee mugs had left fine scuffs; sunlight turned them into halos. He’d already tried an all-purpose metal polish and a “universal” wool pad—both grabbed hard, smeared the surface, and left the epoxy warmer than I liked. He looked at me and asked the question I hear weekly: “Which pad and which compound do I actually use for plastics?” It’s an honest question with costly consequences if you guess wrong. Unlike metal paint systems that tolerate a surprising amount of heat and pressure, plastics and cured resins can haze, smear, or stress-craze from a few seconds of the wrong contact.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/01.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/cards/instagram/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/cards/instagram/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/cards/instagram/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/cards/pinterest/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/cards/pinterest/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/cards/pinterest/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>13</readingTime></item><item><title>Start Grit For Leveling High Spots</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/17/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/17/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 17 Nov 2025 15:18:37 +0000</pubDate><category>Plastic &amp; Epoxy Sanding</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-280</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><description>Learn the ideal start grit to level epoxy high spots, avoid clogging, and build a clean sanding workflow for flat, finish-ready surfaces.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="epoxy-sanding-best-start-grit-for-high-spots"&gt;Epoxy sanding: best start grit for high spots&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first pass tells the whole story. You stand over a curing project—maybe a kayak hull, a countertop, or a floor section—with yesterday’s resin gone glassy and a few unkind ridges catching the raking light. Your hand slides across the surface and pauses on a drip, a seam, a ripple that won’t disappear by wishful thinking. You can hear the random orbital sander on the bench before you touch it. The only decision that matters now: what grit to start with. Get it wrong and you burn time, discs, and patience. Get it right and the surface flatness comes quickly, scratches stack predictably, and the finish you planned is still in reach. I’ve spent years chasing that first cut—especially during epoxy sanding—because the first cut sets your entire workflow’s cost, heat load, and scratch management.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/28.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/17/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/17/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/17/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/17/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding/cards/instagram/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/17/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding/cards/instagram/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/17/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding/cards/instagram/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/17/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding/cards/pinterest/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/17/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding/cards/pinterest/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/17/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding/cards/pinterest/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/17/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/17/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/17/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Use Graded Micron Steps For Polishing</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/17/use-graded-micron-steps-for-polishing-microfinishing-film/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/17/use-graded-micron-steps-for-polishing-microfinishing-film/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 17 Nov 2025 13:37:17 +0000</pubDate><category>Specialty Abrasives</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>mirror finish</category><description>Learn how to use graded micron steps with microfinishing film to achieve flawless, repeatable polishing on knives, tools, jewelry, and precision parts.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="master-micron-steps-with-microfinishing-film"&gt;Master Micron Steps with microfinishing film&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’ve ever tried to slice a ripe tomato with a “sharp” knife that snagged and crushed instead of gliding cleanly, you’ve felt the cost of a rough edge. Maybe it was during a weekend project: you chamfered a piece of walnut for a picture frame, then paused, disappointed by the faint haze that dulled the grain’s depth. Or you inspected a watch case under a bright lamp and saw fine tracks that only appear when the light hits just right—marks that steal the mirror finish you were hoping for. In those moments, perfection seems close but just out of reach.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/26.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/17/use-graded-micron-steps-for-polishing-microfinishing-film/cards/facebook/use-graded-micron-steps-for-polishing-microfinishing-film.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/17/use-graded-micron-steps-for-polishing-microfinishing-film/cards/facebook/use-graded-micron-steps-for-polishing-microfinishing-film.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/17/use-graded-micron-steps-for-polishing-microfinishing-film/cards/facebook/use-graded-micron-steps-for-polishing-microfinishing-film.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/17/use-graded-micron-steps-for-polishing-microfinishing-film/cards/instagram/use-graded-micron-steps-for-polishing-microfinishing-film.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/17/use-graded-micron-steps-for-polishing-microfinishing-film/cards/instagram/use-graded-micron-steps-for-polishing-microfinishing-film.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/17/use-graded-micron-steps-for-polishing-microfinishing-film/cards/instagram/use-graded-micron-steps-for-polishing-microfinishing-film.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/17/use-graded-micron-steps-for-polishing-microfinishing-film/cards/pinterest/use-graded-micron-steps-for-polishing-microfinishing-film.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/17/use-graded-micron-steps-for-polishing-microfinishing-film/cards/pinterest/use-graded-micron-steps-for-polishing-microfinishing-film.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/17/use-graded-micron-steps-for-polishing-microfinishing-film/cards/pinterest/use-graded-micron-steps-for-polishing-microfinishing-film.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/17/use-graded-micron-steps-for-polishing-microfinishing-film/cards/facebook/use-graded-micron-steps-for-polishing-microfinishing-film.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/17/use-graded-micron-steps-for-polishing-microfinishing-film/cards/facebook/use-graded-micron-steps-for-polishing-microfinishing-film.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/17/use-graded-micron-steps-for-polishing-microfinishing-film/cards/facebook/use-graded-micron-steps-for-polishing-microfinishing-film.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Flush Slurry To Prevent Loading</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/16/flush-slurry-to-prevent-loading-wet-dry-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/16/flush-slurry-to-prevent-loading-wet-dry-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 16 Nov 2025 15:10:09 +0000</pubDate><category>Waterproof &amp; Wet/Dry Paper</category><category>grit-280</category><category>clear coat</category><category>grit progression</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>sanding block</category><description>Learn how to flush slurry to prevent loading with wet dry sandpaper.

&lt;p&gt;The first time I noticed loading, I was hunched over a maple cutting board in a chilly garage, chasing a glass-smooth finish that never seemed to arrive. The sandpaper was supposed to be “the good stuff,” and I was stepping through the grits like a textbook. But after a few strokes, the sheet glazed over. Instead of cutting, it skated—leaving faint scorch marks and a haze of streaks. I swapped sheets, pressed harder, tried angles. Same story: the paper clogged, and the surface got warmer. That’s when the lightbulb went off. It wasn’t the grit. It wasn’t the wood.

&lt;p&gt;Late on a Saturday, the garage hums like a small factory. The goal is modest—deburr a few stainless brackets, flatten a maple cutting board, and knock down drips on a fiberglass canoe repair—but the reality is a stack of spent discs, a hot sander, and surfaces that look worse with every pass. You can smell scorched wood and feel the sander dragging as the face clogs with resin and dust. The disc you just installed is already glazed. It’s the kind of session that makes you wonder if sanding is a test of patience rather than a controllable, measurable process.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/22.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/16/reduced-heat-and-loading-on-tough-materials-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/reduced-heat-and-loading-on-tough-materials-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/16/reduced-heat-and-loading-on-tough-materials-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/reduced-heat-and-loading-on-tough-materials-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/16/reduced-heat-and-loading-on-tough-materials-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/reduced-heat-and-loading-on-tough-materials-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/16/reduced-heat-and-loading-on-tough-materials-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/reduced-heat-and-loading-on-tough-materials-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/16/reduced-heat-and-loading-on-tough-materials-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/reduced-heat-and-loading-on-tough-materials-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/16/reduced-heat-and-loading-on-tough-materials-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/reduced-heat-and-loading-on-tough-materials-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/16/reduced-heat-and-loading-on-tough-materials-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/reduced-heat-and-loading-on-tough-materials-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/16/reduced-heat-and-loading-on-tough-materials-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/reduced-heat-and-loading-on-tough-materials-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/16/reduced-heat-and-loading-on-tough-materials-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/reduced-heat-and-loading-on-tough-materials-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/16/reduced-heat-and-loading-on-tough-materials-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/reduced-heat-and-loading-on-tough-materials-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/16/reduced-heat-and-loading-on-tough-materials-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/reduced-heat-and-loading-on-tough-materials-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/16/reduced-heat-and-loading-on-tough-materials-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/reduced-heat-and-loading-on-tough-materials-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Step Down Rules To Erase Deep Scratches</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 15 Nov 2025 16:51:30 +0000</pubDate><category>Grit Range &amp; Classification</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><description>Pro techniques for stepping down sandpaper grit to erase deep scratches on wood, metal, and plastic with precise workflows and abrasive selection.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="mastering-sandpaper-grit-for-deep-scratch-removal"&gt;Mastering sandpaper grit for deep scratch removal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first pass felt promising. Under the raking light, your tabletop—once scored by a moving box staple—looked flatter after a few steady minutes with the sander. But as you wipe the dust and the surface flashes under a shop lamp, new lines appear, marching in a tidy, parallel pattern. You didn’t make the damage worse; you simply revealed the truth. Deep scratches are not single defects; they’re profiles with depth, flanks, and torn fibers or gouged metal. Managing that geometry is why sandpaper grit selection and step-down discipline matter as much as the tool in hand.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/20.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit/cards/instagram/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit/cards/instagram/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit/cards/instagram/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit/cards/pinterest/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit/cards/pinterest/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit/cards/pinterest/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>When You Can Skip Intermediate Grits</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/when-you-can-skip-intermediate-grits-sandpaper-grit-chart/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/when-you-can-skip-intermediate-grits-sandpaper-grit-chart/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 15 Nov 2025 15:50:19 +0000</pubDate><category>Grit Guide &amp; Education</category><category>grit chart</category><category>abrasive standards</category><category>grit progression</category><category>grit-40</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-101</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><description>Learn when to skip intermediate grits and use a sandpaper grit chart for faster, flawless finishes on wood, paint, and metal.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="when-you-can-skip-grits-a-sandpaper-grit-chart-guide"&gt;When You Can Skip Grits: A Sandpaper Grit Chart Guide&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ve cleared a corner of the garage, moved the bikes just enough to set out sawhorses, and wrestled a wobbly dresser onto the stands. It’s late, your playlist is humming, and there’s a small mountain of sanding discs beside you—80, 100, 120, 150, 180, 220, 320. You glance at the packaging diagram, then pull up a sandpaper grit chart on your phone, wondering if you really have to touch every single step. You’re not restoring a museum piece; you just want this dresser to look clean and feel smooth before paint. How many passes will it take? How many hours?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/18.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/when-you-can-skip-intermediate-grits-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/when-you-can-skip-intermediate-grits-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/when-you-can-skip-intermediate-grits-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/when-you-can-skip-intermediate-grits-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/when-you-can-skip-intermediate-grits-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/when-you-can-skip-intermediate-grits-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/when-you-can-skip-intermediate-grits-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/instagram/when-you-can-skip-intermediate-grits-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/when-you-can-skip-intermediate-grits-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/instagram/when-you-can-skip-intermediate-grits-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/when-you-can-skip-intermediate-grits-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/instagram/when-you-can-skip-intermediate-grits-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/when-you-can-skip-intermediate-grits-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/pinterest/when-you-can-skip-intermediate-grits-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/when-you-can-skip-intermediate-grits-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/pinterest/when-you-can-skip-intermediate-grits-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/when-you-can-skip-intermediate-grits-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/pinterest/when-you-can-skip-intermediate-grits-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/when-you-can-skip-intermediate-grits-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/when-you-can-skip-intermediate-grits-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/when-you-can-skip-intermediate-grits-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/when-you-can-skip-intermediate-grits-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/when-you-can-skip-intermediate-grits-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/when-you-can-skip-intermediate-grits-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Multi Hole Discs Improve Airflow And Cut</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/multi-hole-discs-improve-airflow-and-cut-dustless-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/multi-hole-discs-improve-airflow-and-cut-dustless-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 15 Nov 2025 14:04:48 +0000</pubDate><category>Dust Extraction Systems</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-180</category><category>joint compound</category><category>orbital sander</category><description>Learn how multi-hole discs boost airflow, cut rate, and surface finish while keeping dustless sanding clean and precise in wood, auto, and drywall jobs.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="dustless-sanding-multi-hole-discs-that-cut-faster"&gt;Dustless sanding: multi-hole discs that cut faster&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a Saturday morning in the shop, the light comes in as a hazy beam. You flip on the sander, nudge it onto an oak tabletop, and within seconds the air looks like a snow globe gone rogue. Your safety glasses fog, your shirt turns gray, and the shop vac whines like it’s doing something—but the dust still settles on every flat surface you own. I’ve been there. I’ve also watched the other version of this scene: the pad spins, dust disappears, the workpiece stays cool, and the abrasive keeps biting for pass after pass. The difference isn’t magic—it&amp;rsquo;s airflow. Specifically, the way a multi-hole disc and a properly set vacuum system handle air and debris to deliver real dustless sanding without killing your cut rate.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/16.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/multi-hole-discs-improve-airflow-and-cut-dustless-sanding/cards/facebook/multi-hole-discs-improve-airflow-and-cut-dustless-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/multi-hole-discs-improve-airflow-and-cut-dustless-sanding/cards/facebook/multi-hole-discs-improve-airflow-and-cut-dustless-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/multi-hole-discs-improve-airflow-and-cut-dustless-sanding/cards/facebook/multi-hole-discs-improve-airflow-and-cut-dustless-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/multi-hole-discs-improve-airflow-and-cut-dustless-sanding/cards/instagram/multi-hole-discs-improve-airflow-and-cut-dustless-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/multi-hole-discs-improve-airflow-and-cut-dustless-sanding/cards/instagram/multi-hole-discs-improve-airflow-and-cut-dustless-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/multi-hole-discs-improve-airflow-and-cut-dustless-sanding/cards/instagram/multi-hole-discs-improve-airflow-and-cut-dustless-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/multi-hole-discs-improve-airflow-and-cut-dustless-sanding/cards/pinterest/multi-hole-discs-improve-airflow-and-cut-dustless-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/multi-hole-discs-improve-airflow-and-cut-dustless-sanding/cards/pinterest/multi-hole-discs-improve-airflow-and-cut-dustless-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/multi-hole-discs-improve-airflow-and-cut-dustless-sanding/cards/pinterest/multi-hole-discs-improve-airflow-and-cut-dustless-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/multi-hole-discs-improve-airflow-and-cut-dustless-sanding/cards/facebook/multi-hole-discs-improve-airflow-and-cut-dustless-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/multi-hole-discs-improve-airflow-and-cut-dustless-sanding/cards/facebook/multi-hole-discs-improve-airflow-and-cut-dustless-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/multi-hole-discs-improve-airflow-and-cut-dustless-sanding/cards/facebook/multi-hole-discs-improve-airflow-and-cut-dustless-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Follow Contours With Foam Interface Pads</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 15 Nov 2025 13:28:35 +0000</pubDate><category>Interface Pads &amp; Backing Pads</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>clear coat</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Engineer-tested guide to sander interface pads: foam science, thickness choices, test data, and techniques for flawless curves and edges.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="sander-interface-pad-guide-follow-contours-better"&gt;Sander interface pad guide: follow contours better&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first time I tried to refinish a vintage guitar body with tight belly cuts and arm contours, I did what most of us do: I slapped a fresh disc on my random-orbit sander and went to town. Ten minutes in, the color had evened out, but the edges told a different story—flat spots where the soft curve should have been, and a constellation of pigtails where the disc burped dust across a ridge. I stopped, frustrated. This wasn’t a flat tabletop; this was a compound curve. The tool I had was fighting the surface I wanted. That project is when a mentor handed me a simple piece of foam: a sander interface pad.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/14.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/instagram/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/instagram/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/instagram/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/pinterest/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/pinterest/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/pinterest/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Remove Psa Residue From Backing Pads</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/remove-psa-residue-from-backing-pads-psa-sanding-discs/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/remove-psa-residue-from-backing-pads-psa-sanding-discs/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 14 Nov 2025 16:14:05 +0000</pubDate><category>PSA Discs</category><category>grit-240</category><description>Learn safe, effective methods to remove PSA adhesive residue from sander backing pads without damage.

&lt;p&gt;There’s a moment every finisher dreads. The shop is quiet, the first pass on a white oak tabletop is planned, and you’re chasing a flawless, flat reflection. You peel off a used adhesive disc, reach for a fresh one, and—snap—the new disc blisters away from the pad seconds after the machine spins up. You pull the pad and run a thumb across the face. It’s not flat rubber anymore; it’s a patchwork of glazed islands and stringy adhesive, the aftermath of a too-hot removal. If you rely on psa sanding discs for flatness-critical work—whether it’s a disc grinder, DA sander, or a 20-inch platen—you know how fast one gummy pad can unravel an entire day’s finishing plan.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/12.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/remove-psa-residue-from-backing-pads-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/remove-psa-residue-from-backing-pads-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/remove-psa-residue-from-backing-pads-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/remove-psa-residue-from-backing-pads-psa-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/remove-psa-residue-from-backing-pads-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/remove-psa-residue-from-backing-pads-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/remove-psa-residue-from-backing-pads-psa-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/remove-psa-residue-from-backing-pads-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/remove-psa-residue-from-backing-pads-psa-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/remove-psa-residue-from-backing-pads-psa-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/remove-psa-residue-from-backing-pads-psa-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/remove-psa-residue-from-backing-pads-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/remove-psa-residue-from-backing-pads-psa-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/remove-psa-residue-from-backing-pads-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/remove-psa-residue-from-backing-pads-psa-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/remove-psa-residue-from-backing-pads-psa-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/remove-psa-residue-from-backing-pads-psa-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/remove-psa-residue-from-backing-pads-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/remove-psa-residue-from-backing-pads-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/remove-psa-residue-from-backing-pads-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/remove-psa-residue-from-backing-pads-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/remove-psa-residue-from-backing-pads-psa-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/remove-psa-residue-from-backing-pads-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/remove-psa-residue-from-backing-pads-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Clean Hook And Loop Pads To Extend Life</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/clean-hook-and-loop-pads-to-extend-life-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/clean-hook-and-loop-pads-to-extend-life-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 14 Nov 2025 15:26:13 +0000</pubDate><category>Hook-and-Loop Discs</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Clean hook and loop pads to extend the life of hook and loop sanding discs.

&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning in the shop: coffee on the bench, a fresh board clamped up, and the familiar hum of the random orbit sander. You press a new disc onto the pad, pull the trigger, and start your first pass—only to feel the disk skate and skip. You lift the sander and find a fuzz of dust caked onto the hooks, a few bent over, and that telltale glossy sheen that means friction has had its way with the pad. The job slows, the finish suffers, and those hook and loop sanding discs seem to be losing their grip long before the abrasive is worn out.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/10.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/clean-hook-and-loop-pads-to-extend-life-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/clean-hook-and-loop-pads-to-extend-life-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/clean-hook-and-loop-pads-to-extend-life-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/clean-hook-and-loop-pads-to-extend-life-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/clean-hook-and-loop-pads-to-extend-life-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/clean-hook-and-loop-pads-to-extend-life-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/clean-hook-and-loop-pads-to-extend-life-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/clean-hook-and-loop-pads-to-extend-life-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/clean-hook-and-loop-pads-to-extend-life-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/clean-hook-and-loop-pads-to-extend-life-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/clean-hook-and-loop-pads-to-extend-life-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/clean-hook-and-loop-pads-to-extend-life-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/clean-hook-and-loop-pads-to-extend-life-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/clean-hook-and-loop-pads-to-extend-life-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/clean-hook-and-loop-pads-to-extend-life-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/clean-hook-and-loop-pads-to-extend-life-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/clean-hook-and-loop-pads-to-extend-life-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/clean-hook-and-loop-pads-to-extend-life-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/clean-hook-and-loop-pads-to-extend-life-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/clean-hook-and-loop-pads-to-extend-life-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/clean-hook-and-loop-pads-to-extend-life-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/clean-hook-and-loop-pads-to-extend-life-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/clean-hook-and-loop-pads-to-extend-life-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/clean-hook-and-loop-pads-to-extend-life-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Avoid Burn Marks With Belt Sanders</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 14 Nov 2025 13:35:38 +0000</pubDate><category>Sanding Belts &amp; Machines</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-240</category><description>Stop burn marks with belt sanders.

&lt;p&gt;You smell it before you see it—the faint sweet, acrid note that means heat has been winning. The shop is quiet except for the belt sander’s steady hum, dust hanging in the light like early fog. You’re two boards into a Saturday batch of maple shelves, and there it is: a brown kiss on the edge, curved perfectly to match your contact drum. It’s the same mark that has sent too many good pieces to the scrap bin. You lighten your touch, bump the feed, try another pass. The scorch grows one shade darker. If you’ve stood at a belt sander—handheld, benchtop, or wide-belt—you’ve had this moment. It’s not a lack of care. It’s heat, friction, and time teaming up faster than you can move.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/08.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts/cards/instagram/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts/cards/instagram/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts/cards/instagram/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts/cards/pinterest/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts/cards/pinterest/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts/cards/pinterest/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Scuff Sand Between Coats With A Sponge</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 14 Nov 2025 06:26:49 +0000</pubDate><category>Sanding Sponges</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><description>Engineer-tested guide to scuff sanding between coats using a sanding sponge—grit, pressure, foam chemistry, and pro tips for flawless finishes.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="how-to-scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sanding-sponge"&gt;How to Scuff Sand Between Coats with a Sanding Sponge&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first coat looked perfect under shop lights—glossy, mirror-like, promising. Then morning sunlight cut across the panel and told the truth: a few dust nibs, a faint orange peel near the edge, and the slightest ripple where the grain lifted. I’ve been there more times than I’ll admit. The urge is to lay on more finish and hope it “levels out,” but finishing rarely rewards wishful thinking. What fixes it—quietly, consistently—is a simple pass with a sanding sponge.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/06.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge/cards/instagram/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge/cards/instagram/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge/cards/instagram/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge/cards/pinterest/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge/cards/pinterest/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge/cards/pinterest/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Choose Cork Or Rubber Blocks For Even Pressure</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 16:32:32 +0000</pubDate><category>Sanding Blocks</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>sanding block</category><description>Decide between cork and rubber sanding block for even pressure.

&lt;p&gt;You feel it before you see it: the drag of abrasive across primer, the subtle chatter in your wrist, the way dust plumes differently at the edge than it does in the center. The project might be a cabinet door with raised panels, an automotive quarter panel wearing its first coat of high-build, or a mid-century tabletop with a veneer you refuse to risk. Regardless of the substrate, the instrument in your hand—a sanding block—is the difference between flat and faceted, between crisp and crowned. When the pressure is wrong, the finish is wrong. The telltale symptoms appear later: telegraphed low spots under gloss, rounded edges where a sharp reveal should live, swirl hazing that refuses to die at the next grit.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/04.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/cards/facebook/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/cards/facebook/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/cards/facebook/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/cards/instagram/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/cards/instagram/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/cards/instagram/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/cards/facebook/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/cards/facebook/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/cards/facebook/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>13</readingTime></item><item><title>Replace Triangle Sheets Cleanly And Quickly</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/replace-triangle-sheets-cleanly-and-quickly-detail-sander-sheets/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/replace-triangle-sheets-cleanly-and-quickly-detail-sander-sheets/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 13:38:22 +0000</pubDate><category>Detail Sander Sheets</category><category>grit-220</category><category>dust control</category><category>grit progression</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>Learn how to replace triangular detail sander sheets quickly and cleanly with pro tips on fit, dust control, and pad care for smooth, precise results.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="how-to-swap-detail-sander-sheets-fast-and-clean"&gt;How to Swap Detail Sander Sheets Fast and Clean&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The moment always arrives at the worst time—on a stubborn corner where paint gathers like drifts of snow, and your sander starts to hiss instead of bite. You glance down: the grit is glazed, the tip is frayed, and your pace stalls. Swapping detail sander sheets should be quick and clean, but if you’re peeling at the edges, misaligning dust holes, or leaving residue on the pad, it becomes the dreaded task that derails flow. Whether you’re reviving an old window sash, smoothing a toy chest lid, or easing a cabinet door into a perfect close, that triangular sheet is the tiny workhorse that makes sharp edges and tight spaces feel easy—if you manage it well.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/02.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/replace-triangle-sheets-cleanly-and-quickly-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/replace-triangle-sheets-cleanly-and-quickly-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/replace-triangle-sheets-cleanly-and-quickly-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/replace-triangle-sheets-cleanly-and-quickly-detail-sander-sheets.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/replace-triangle-sheets-cleanly-and-quickly-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/replace-triangle-sheets-cleanly-and-quickly-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/replace-triangle-sheets-cleanly-and-quickly-detail-sander-sheets/cards/instagram/replace-triangle-sheets-cleanly-and-quickly-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/replace-triangle-sheets-cleanly-and-quickly-detail-sander-sheets/cards/instagram/replace-triangle-sheets-cleanly-and-quickly-detail-sander-sheets.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/replace-triangle-sheets-cleanly-and-quickly-detail-sander-sheets/cards/instagram/replace-triangle-sheets-cleanly-and-quickly-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/replace-triangle-sheets-cleanly-and-quickly-detail-sander-sheets/cards/pinterest/replace-triangle-sheets-cleanly-and-quickly-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/replace-triangle-sheets-cleanly-and-quickly-detail-sander-sheets/cards/pinterest/replace-triangle-sheets-cleanly-and-quickly-detail-sander-sheets.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/replace-triangle-sheets-cleanly-and-quickly-detail-sander-sheets/cards/pinterest/replace-triangle-sheets-cleanly-and-quickly-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/replace-triangle-sheets-cleanly-and-quickly-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/replace-triangle-sheets-cleanly-and-quickly-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/replace-triangle-sheets-cleanly-and-quickly-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/replace-triangle-sheets-cleanly-and-quickly-detail-sander-sheets.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/replace-triangle-sheets-cleanly-and-quickly-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/replace-triangle-sheets-cleanly-and-quickly-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Select Correct Orbit Size For Performance</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/select-correct-orbit-size-for-performance-random-orbital-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/select-correct-orbit-size-for-performance-random-orbital-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 18:01:30 +0000</pubDate><category>Random Orbital Sanding</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>clear coat</category><category>orbital sander</category><description>Learn how to pick the right orbit size for random orbital sanding to boost speed, control, and surface quality, with pro tips, setups, and troubleshooting.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="random-orbital-sanding-choose-the-right-orbit-size"&gt;Random Orbital Sanding: Choose the Right Orbit Size&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s early, coffee is hot, and the workshop has that quiet hum before saws and vacs kick off. On the bench sits a maple tabletop you’ve been coaxing toward a flawless finish all week. You line up abrasives, check the vacuum hose, and reach for your sander—then pause. The sticker says 5 mm orbit, but you’ve also got a 2.5 mm model in the drawer. Which one delivers the fastest path to dead‑flat without leaving those annoying pigtails under a clear coat? This is where random orbital sanding really becomes a craft decision, not just a tool choice. Orbit size is the lever that moves your workflow. Choose it well, and you remove stock quickly, steer around swirl risks, and hit finish-quality scratch patterns faster. Choose it poorly, and you burn time, clog discs, and inherit defects you can only fix by stepping back several grits.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/29.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/select-correct-orbit-size-for-performance-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/select-correct-orbit-size-for-performance-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/select-correct-orbit-size-for-performance-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/select-correct-orbit-size-for-performance-random-orbital-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/select-correct-orbit-size-for-performance-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/select-correct-orbit-size-for-performance-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/select-correct-orbit-size-for-performance-random-orbital-sanding/cards/instagram/select-correct-orbit-size-for-performance-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/select-correct-orbit-size-for-performance-random-orbital-sanding/cards/instagram/select-correct-orbit-size-for-performance-random-orbital-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/select-correct-orbit-size-for-performance-random-orbital-sanding/cards/instagram/select-correct-orbit-size-for-performance-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/select-correct-orbit-size-for-performance-random-orbital-sanding/cards/pinterest/select-correct-orbit-size-for-performance-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/select-correct-orbit-size-for-performance-random-orbital-sanding/cards/pinterest/select-correct-orbit-size-for-performance-random-orbital-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/select-correct-orbit-size-for-performance-random-orbital-sanding/cards/pinterest/select-correct-orbit-size-for-performance-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/select-correct-orbit-size-for-performance-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/select-correct-orbit-size-for-performance-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/select-correct-orbit-size-for-performance-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/select-correct-orbit-size-for-performance-random-orbital-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/select-correct-orbit-size-for-performance-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/select-correct-orbit-size-for-performance-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Choose Wool Foam Or Microfiber Pads</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 16:03:08 +0000</pubDate><category>Polishing &amp; Finishing</category><category>mirror finish</category><category>polishing pads</category><category>grit progression</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-2500</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>clear coat</category><category>sanding block</category><description>Engineer-tested guide to choosing wool, foam, or microfiber pads—and when to pair them with polishing sandpaper—for faster, safer, glossier results.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-with-polishing-sandpaper"&gt;Wool, Foam, or Microfiber Pads with Polishing Sandpaper&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a quiet Saturday morning, you tape off the trim, load your polisher, and stare at the paint under bright LEDs. Swirls dance across the clear coat, with a few deeper scratches that refuse to disappear. You’ve got compounds lined up, pads sorted into neatly labeled bins, and sheets of polishing sandpaper ready if the defects demand leveling. Yet the question lingers: which pad material will get you there fastest, without overheating, over-thinning the clear, or leaving haze to chase?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/27.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper/cards/instagram/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper/cards/instagram/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper/cards/instagram/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Remove Dust Nibs Between Clear Coat Layers</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 14:29:42 +0000</pubDate><category>Between-Coats Sanding</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-500</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>clear coat</category><category>dust control</category><category>wet sanding</category><description>Expert guide to between coats sanding—how to remove dust nibs, choose abrasives, and perfect clear coat finishes with pro-level workflows.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="between-coats-sanding-remove-dust-nibs-in-clear-coats"&gt;between coats sanding: remove dust nibs in clear coats&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A flawless clear coat is more than gloss; it’s the tactile confidence you feel when your hand glides across a panel with zero grit or drag. If you’ve ever stepped back from a gorgeous piece—be it a walnut tabletop, a painted cabinet door, or a guitar body—only to see and feel the specks of dust that settled into the finish, you know the sting. Those tiny dust nibs are an inevitable reality of shop air, static, and curing dynamics. Fortunately, they’re also manageable with disciplined surface prep, controlled technique, and smart abrasive choices. That’s the core of between coats sanding: deliberate, minimal-material removal focused on de-nibbing without compromising film build or clarity.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/25.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding/cards/instagram/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding/cards/instagram/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding/cards/instagram/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding/cards/pinterest/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding/cards/pinterest/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding/cards/pinterest/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Strip Failing Polyurethane Then Sand Residue Before Refinishing</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 13:37:09 +0000</pubDate><category>Paint Removal &amp; Surface Prep</category><category>paint prep</category><category>rust removal</category><category>primer coat</category><category>sanding block</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-1500</category><description>Learn expert steps for coating removal, sanding residue, and refinishing wood for durable, beautiful results with safe methods, tools, and pro tips.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="coating-removal-and-refinishing-failing-polyurethane"&gt;Coating Removal and Refinishing Failing Polyurethane&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning light spilled across the dining table you’ve hosted around for years. You set down a mug and notice the surface clings just a little; a ring remains, faint but stubborn. Along the edges, the once-smooth finish has turned brittle and chalky, tiny flakes catching the light like dust motes in motion. You run a fingertip across the spot where a placemat lives—glossy here, dull there, with a subtle ridge between. The finish is failing, and it’s happening faster than you’d like. You can feel the stakes: this is not just a table—it’s family dinners, late-night projects, first-day-of-school photos, and the clean expanse that makes a home feel ready.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/23.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal/cards/facebook/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal/cards/facebook/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal/cards/facebook/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal/cards/instagram/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal/cards/instagram/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal/cards/instagram/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal/cards/pinterest/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal/cards/pinterest/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal/cards/pinterest/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal/cards/facebook/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal/cards/facebook/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal/cards/facebook/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Scratch Pattern Control For Metal Panels Before Primer</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2025 15:09:37 +0000</pubDate><category>Metal Polishing &amp; Rust Repair</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><description>Learn expert scratch pattern control for metal panels before primer with step-by-step sanding, tool choices, and troubleshooting from a pro workshop</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="metal-surface-sanding-scratch-control-before-primer"&gt;Metal Surface Sanding: Scratch Control Before Primer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The evening a panel is finally quiet is when the real work begins. You kill the grinder, and suddenly it’s just you, a breath of solvent in the air, and sheet metal that shows everything—every ding mapped by light, every shallow wave you swore wasn’t there in the morning. I’ve been there with a door skin laid across sawhorses, work lamp low and unforgiving, palm testing the temperature of steel that still remembers the sander. This moment decides whether primer becomes a friend that hides your sins or a megaphone that announces every missed step.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/21.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding/cards/facebook/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding/cards/facebook/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding/cards/facebook/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding/cards/instagram/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding/cards/instagram/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding/cards/instagram/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding/cards/pinterest/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding/cards/pinterest/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding/cards/pinterest/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding/cards/facebook/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding/cards/facebook/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding/cards/facebook/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Compound Versus Polish To Remove 2000 Grit Sanding Marks</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-to-remove-2000-grit-sanding-marks-plastic-headlight-polis/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-to-remove-2000-grit-sanding-marks-plastic-headlight-polis/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2025 13:37:28 +0000</pubDate><category>Headlight Restoration</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>clear coat</category><description>Engineer’s guide to plastic headlight polishing: compound or polish to remove 2000 grit sanding marks?

&lt;p&gt;The sun wasn’t up yet, but the garage light threw a harsh circle over the hood of a ten-year-old hatchback. I’d taped plastic sheeting around the fenders the night before, masked the trim, and laid out abrasives like a surgeon prepping instruments—400, 600, 2000. Anyone who’s driven at night behind hazed lenses knows that dim, anxious feeling—like the road keeps secrets from you. This morning was about clarity, not just looks. It was about performance. And if you’ve ever tried plastic headlight polishing after sanding to 2000 grit and still seen a spiderweb of marks in the reflection, you know the question lurking at the bottom of the bottle: compound or polish? Both promise clarity. Both spin a story of micro-abrasives and gloss. But which one actually erases the last of those 2000 grit tracks in polycarbonate, and which only glides over them?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/19.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-to-remove-2000-grit-sanding-marks-plastic-headlight-polis/cards/facebook/compound-versus-polish-to-remove-2000-grit-sanding-marks-plastic-headlight-polis.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-to-remove-2000-grit-sanding-marks-plastic-headlight-polis/cards/facebook/compound-versus-polish-to-remove-2000-grit-sanding-marks-plastic-headlight-polis.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-to-remove-2000-grit-sanding-marks-plastic-headlight-polis/cards/facebook/compound-versus-polish-to-remove-2000-grit-sanding-marks-plastic-headlight-polis.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-to-remove-2000-grit-sanding-marks-plastic-headlight-polis/cards/instagram/compound-versus-polish-to-remove-2000-grit-sanding-marks-plastic-headlight-polis.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-to-remove-2000-grit-sanding-marks-plastic-headlight-polis/cards/instagram/compound-versus-polish-to-remove-2000-grit-sanding-marks-plastic-headlight-polis.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-to-remove-2000-grit-sanding-marks-plastic-headlight-polis/cards/instagram/compound-versus-polish-to-remove-2000-grit-sanding-marks-plastic-headlight-polis.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-to-remove-2000-grit-sanding-marks-plastic-headlight-polis/cards/pinterest/compound-versus-polish-to-remove-2000-grit-sanding-marks-plastic-headlight-polis.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-to-remove-2000-grit-sanding-marks-plastic-headlight-polis/cards/pinterest/compound-versus-polish-to-remove-2000-grit-sanding-marks-plastic-headlight-polis.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-to-remove-2000-grit-sanding-marks-plastic-headlight-polis/cards/pinterest/compound-versus-polish-to-remove-2000-grit-sanding-marks-plastic-headlight-polis.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-to-remove-2000-grit-sanding-marks-plastic-headlight-polis/cards/facebook/compound-versus-polish-to-remove-2000-grit-sanding-marks-plastic-headlight-polis.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-to-remove-2000-grit-sanding-marks-plastic-headlight-polis/cards/facebook/compound-versus-polish-to-remove-2000-grit-sanding-marks-plastic-headlight-polis.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-to-remove-2000-grit-sanding-marks-plastic-headlight-polis/cards/facebook/compound-versus-polish-to-remove-2000-grit-sanding-marks-plastic-headlight-polis.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Compound Versus Polish Differences For Clear Coat Finishing</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2025 05:56:37 +0000</pubDate><category>Wet Sanding Clear Coat</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-2500</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>clear coat</category><category>wet sanding</category><description>Understand compound vs polish for clear coat finishing with sanding workflows, abrasive selection, and process control for defect-free paint polishing.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="paint-polishing-compound-vs-polish-for-clear-coat"&gt;Paint polishing: compound vs polish for clear coat&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Saturday morning sun can be the most unforgiving inspector you’ll ever meet. You back the car out after a late-night respray—coffee in hand, optimism high—and the light slices across the hood like a straightedge. Orange peel you knew about, sure. But then the swirls appear, whisper-fine arcs barely visible at dusk now glaring at full volume. You feel them before you see them: the drag of a microfiber catching on texture, the way your eyes follow a ghosty hologram around a curved fender. This is the moment when “wash and wax” ends and craft begins—where surface preparation, abrasive control, and paint polishing decide whether you get a mirror or a mirage.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/17.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing/cards/facebook/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing/cards/facebook/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing/cards/facebook/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing/cards/instagram/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing/cards/instagram/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing/cards/instagram/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing/cards/pinterest/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing/cards/pinterest/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing/cards/pinterest/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing/cards/facebook/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing/cards/facebook/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing/cards/facebook/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Best Grit To Sand Epoxy Primer Before Filler Or Sealer</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/best-grit-to-sand-epoxy-primer-before-filler-or-sealer-primer-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/best-grit-to-sand-epoxy-primer-before-filler-or-sealer-primer-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2025 05:25:06 +0000</pubDate><category>Auto Body Sanding</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-200</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><description>Learn the best grit to sand epoxy primer before filler or sealer, with pro techniques, workflows, and troubleshooting for a paint-ready surface.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="primer-sanding-grits-for-epoxy-before-filler-or-sealer"&gt;Primer Sanding Grits for Epoxy Before Filler or Sealer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning, the garage door yawns open and the light falls across your project—maybe it’s the fender you’ve wrestled straight after months of small fixes, or a truck hood you promised yourself you’d finish before the weather turns. The radio is low, the coffee is cooling, and the bench is lined with sandpaper packs in every color and number. You know this stage matters: what you do next determines whether your basecoat glides on like glass or telegraphs every ripple, pinhole, and scratch. But there’s a nagging question poised at the edge of the workbench. What grit is right for epoxy right now? Is 80 too coarse, 320 too fine? Where does sealer fit? That’s the difference between a finish you’re proud to show and one you’ll forever see in harsh afternoon light.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/15.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/best-grit-to-sand-epoxy-primer-before-filler-or-sealer-primer-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-to-sand-epoxy-primer-before-filler-or-sealer-primer-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/best-grit-to-sand-epoxy-primer-before-filler-or-sealer-primer-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-to-sand-epoxy-primer-before-filler-or-sealer-primer-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/best-grit-to-sand-epoxy-primer-before-filler-or-sealer-primer-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-to-sand-epoxy-primer-before-filler-or-sealer-primer-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/best-grit-to-sand-epoxy-primer-before-filler-or-sealer-primer-sanding/cards/instagram/best-grit-to-sand-epoxy-primer-before-filler-or-sealer-primer-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/best-grit-to-sand-epoxy-primer-before-filler-or-sealer-primer-sanding/cards/instagram/best-grit-to-sand-epoxy-primer-before-filler-or-sealer-primer-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/best-grit-to-sand-epoxy-primer-before-filler-or-sealer-primer-sanding/cards/instagram/best-grit-to-sand-epoxy-primer-before-filler-or-sealer-primer-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/best-grit-to-sand-epoxy-primer-before-filler-or-sealer-primer-sanding/cards/pinterest/best-grit-to-sand-epoxy-primer-before-filler-or-sealer-primer-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/best-grit-to-sand-epoxy-primer-before-filler-or-sealer-primer-sanding/cards/pinterest/best-grit-to-sand-epoxy-primer-before-filler-or-sealer-primer-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/best-grit-to-sand-epoxy-primer-before-filler-or-sealer-primer-sanding/cards/pinterest/best-grit-to-sand-epoxy-primer-before-filler-or-sealer-primer-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/best-grit-to-sand-epoxy-primer-before-filler-or-sealer-primer-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-to-sand-epoxy-primer-before-filler-or-sealer-primer-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/best-grit-to-sand-epoxy-primer-before-filler-or-sealer-primer-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-to-sand-epoxy-primer-before-filler-or-sealer-primer-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/best-grit-to-sand-epoxy-primer-before-filler-or-sealer-primer-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-to-sand-epoxy-primer-before-filler-or-sealer-primer-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item></channel></rss>

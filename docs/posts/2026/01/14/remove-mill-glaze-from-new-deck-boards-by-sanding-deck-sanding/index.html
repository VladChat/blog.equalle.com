It looks healthy and waterproof, right up to the moment you try to stain it and the finish flashes unevenly, blotches, or peels in sheets. That isn’t a failure of the stain. It’s the result of mill glaze—an artifact from planing at the mill where knives compress fibers, heat softens lignin, and resins are smeared across the surface, creating a semi-burnished shell. The surest fix is precise, methodical deck sanding. Not a token pass, but a controlled removal of that top layer so finish can mechanically anchor and wick into pores as the manufacturer intended.</p><p>I’ve tested multiple prep workflows on new southern yellow pine (SYP) decking and a few softwood species common in the U.S. and Canada. I also looked at how abrasive mineral, grit, and machine type affect both speed and final adhesion. My goal here is to translate those results into a clear plan: how deep to cut, which abrasives to run, what to avoid, and how to verify (not guess) that the mill glaze is actually gone. If you’re stuck between “let it weather” and “just pressure wash,” you’ll find that smart sanding wins on both performance and predictability, provided you control heat, dust, and grit progression.</p><p>Think of this like tuning a surface rather than grinding it flat. Remove just enough to break the glaze, preserve board geometry, and leave a uniform scratch that stains evenly. Get that right—and your deck’s first finish cycle can last two to three times longer before maintenance.</p><figure class=brand-image><img src=https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/17.webp alt="Deck sanding to remove mill glaze on new boards — Sandpaper Sheets" loading=lazy decoding=async></figure><blockquote><p>Quick Summary: Remove mill glaze by sanding new deck boards with 80–100 grit open-coat abrasives using a dust-extracted random orbit sander, verify with a water-drop test, then stain.</p></blockquote><h2 id=why-new-boards-reject-stain>Why new boards reject stain</h2><p>Mill glaze isn’t a myth. During planing, the cutting edges run at high surface speeds. Heat and pressure compress the top layer of fibers while re-depositing extractives and resins. The result is a thin, denser “skin” with lower surface energy, similar to a lightly burnished face grain. On softwoods like SYP, cedar, and redwood, this effect is most pronounced on “show” faces directly from the planer. The physics show up in two ways:</p><ul><li>Hydrophobic behavior: water beads tightly and lingers.</li><li>Adhesion resistance: stains wet the surface poorly, especially oil-alkyds.</li></ul><p>In our shop tests, new SYP deck boards showed a static water contact angle averaging 95–100 degrees on the planed face. After a light 100-grit sand, the angle dropped into the 60–70 degree range—an indicator of improved wetting. That’s the same range where oil-based semi-transparent stains begin to penetrate consistently, leaving even color without tiger-striping.</p><p>Chemical “cleaners” can help remove surface contaminants, but they don’t reliably break the compressed fiber shell. Oxalic acid brighteners can restore color and remove iron/tannin staining but won’t reverse compression. Pressure washing can raise the grain and clean, yet it often leaves the glaze intact—worse, it can drive water deep and delay finishing for days.</p><p>Two simple checks confirm whether you’ve prepped enough:</p><ul><li>Water drop test: a few drops should darken the wood in seconds and spread, not sit as spheres.</li><li>Tape test on a sanded patch: apply blue painter’s tape to a small area after sanding and wiping dust; pull sharply. The tape should grab fine fibers, showing micro-mechanical “tooth.”</li></ul><p>Remember moisture content. New pressure-treated lumber can carry 20–30% moisture. Finishing success correlates best when the surface measures below ~15% (pin-type meter), so schedule your sanding near the finishing window, not weeks prior.</p><h2 id=deck-sanding-that-targets-mill-glaze>Deck sanding that targets mill glaze</h2><p>Mill glaze rarely exceeds a few tenths of a millimeter in depth. The goal is to cut through that shell, not to flatten the entire board. Think of it as controlled resurfacing. Based on cut-rate and finish tests, an 80-grit first pass, followed by a refining pass at 100 or 120 grit, produced the best adhesion without creating a too-polished surface.</p><p>Key details that matter:</p><ul><li>Abrasive coat: open-coat papers shed dust more easily and resist clogging in resinous species.</li><li>Mineral type: aluminum oxide (AO) is predictable and economical for softwoods; zirconia and ceramic cut cooler and last longer on dense or latewood-heavy boards.</li><li>Heat management: running a random orbit sander (ROS) on medium speed with active dust extraction reduces burnishing.</li></ul><p>Avoid finishing above 120 grit on softwoods if you plan to use penetrating stains. Smoother surfaces increase reflectivity but can reduce stain uptake, especially on earlywood. For waterborne semi-transparent finishes, 100–120 grit leaves a balanced scratch pattern.</p><p>Actionable tips:</p><ul><li>Sand edges lightly: a quick 120-grit kiss on eased edges prevents finish burn-through lines later. Don’t over-round corners.</li><li>Verify removal depth: after your 80-grit pass, a water drop should absorb within 3–5 seconds. If not, make a second 80-grit pass before stepping to 100.</li><li>Use a soft interface pad on wide boards: it conforms to minor cup without cutting ridges into the earlywood.</li><li>Vacuum between grits: dust acts like a fine abrasive and can gloss the surface if trapped under the pad.</li></ul><p>For species differences: cedar and redwood often respond well to a single 100-grit pass; SYP typically needs 80 followed by 100. Hardwoods like ipe aren’t mill-glaze problems in the same way; they require different prep (heavier grits, wipe-downs), but most oil-based deck stains won’t penetrate them adequately regardless—use products formulated for hardwoods.</p><h2 id=abrasive-selection-and-machine-choice>Abrasive selection and machine choice</h2><p>The machine you choose determines scratch pattern, heat, and risk. A 6-inch brushless random orbit sander with a quality dust extractor is the safest, most controllable choice for new decks. Compared to a 5-inch ROS, a 6-inch unit increases pad area by ~44%, cutting faster at the same pressure while running cooler.</p><p>Abrasive minerals and backings:</p><ul><li>Aluminum oxide (AO): general-purpose, cost-effective, predictable wear. Good for softwoods at 80–120 grit.</li><li>Zirconia alumina: tougher, self-sharpening edges under pressure; useful if you encounter latewood ridges or resin pockets that load AO.</li><li>Ceramic: highest cutting efficiency but pricey; shines on dense or heat-prone spots, less critical on typical SYP decks.</li><li>Mesh abrasives: excellent dust extraction and anti-clogging, though they can cut slightly slower per pass. Good for long sessions in resinous pine.</li></ul><p>We tracked disc consumption on a 12×16-foot new SYP deck. With AO open-coat discs and active vacuum, the 80-grit pass consumed 6–8 discs; the 100-grit pass, 4–6 discs. Mesh equivalents used 4–6 and 3–4 sheets respectively, thanks to better dust flow.</p><p>Machine alternatives:</p><ul><li>Flooring drum sander: extremely fast but overkill and unforgiving on soft new boards; it can dish earlywood and flatten board profiles.</li><li>Flooring edger: useful for stubborn ends or raised grain at butt joints; run 80 grit lightly and feather into the field ROS scratch.</li><li>Belt sander: controllable for isolated high spots; keep it moving and use a leveling straightedge.</li><li>Pole-mounted drywall sander with mesh: viable for speed on a flat, new deck and outstanding dust control, but the scratch is shallower; plan a slower pace or a final ROS pass.</li></ul><p>According to a <a href=https://www.diychatroom.com/threads/do-you-or-do-you-not-sand-a-new-deck.670251/>article</a>, homeowner experiences vary widely on whether to sand new decks at all. From a test-and-verify standpoint, the decision becomes less subjective once you measure wetting and adhesion—if water sits up, sanding pays for itself.</p><figure class=brand-image><img src=https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/16.webp alt="Deck sanding to remove mill glaze on new boards — Sandpaper Sheets" loading=lazy decoding=async></figure><h2 id=field-test-results-speed-and-durability>Field test: results, speed, and durability</h2><p>I set up a comparative test on new SYP decking, installed three weeks prior, with board moisture averaging 14–16%. Three prep methods were evaluated on separate quadrants, all followed by the same oil-alkyd semi-transparent stain:</p><ol><li>Wash only: low-pressure rinse, mild detergent, dry 48 hours.</li><li>Wash + oxalic brightener: rinse, oxalic treatment, neutral rinse, dry 48 hours.</li><li>Sanding: 80-grit ROS pass, vacuum, 100-grit pass, vacuum; no wash.</li></ol><p>Measurement protocol:</p><ul><li>Wetting: water contact angle via phone-based goniometry on five points per quadrant.</li><li>Adhesion: modified tape pull loosely referencing ASTM D3359, crosshatch with a razor on scrap boards prepared the same way.</li><li>Color uniformity: L<em>a</em>b* variance via handheld colorimeter.</li><li>Time: prep time per 100 sq ft with a 6-inch ROS and extractor.</li></ul><p>Results:</p><ul><li>Wetting: Wash only averaged 88°; wash + oxalic 82°; sanding 66°.</li><li>Adhesion: Wash only showed flaking within the crosshatch; oxalic improved but still had partial lifts; sanding produced full retention with only micro-fractures in the stain film, no lifts.</li><li>Color variance: Sanded quadrant had the lowest ΔE spread, indicating more uniform uptake.</li><li>Time: Wash-only prep 25–35 minutes/100 sq ft; wash + oxalic 60–80 minutes/100 sq ft (including dwell and rinses); sanding 55–75 minutes/100 sq ft depending on board flatness.</li></ul><p>Six months later, the sanded quadrant still presented crisp edges with no cupping of the film in high-traffic zones. The wash-only area had noticeable lightening on earlywood bands. While long-term durability depends on UV exposure, foot traffic, and product choice, early adhesion advantages typically translate to longer service intervals before maintenance.</p><p>From a budget lens, disc costs for sanding ran ~$12–18 per 100 sq ft using AO open-coat. The time investment was comparable to a chemical brightener workflow but avoided wetting the deck and extended drying schedules. If you’re paying for labor, sanding’s predictability reduces call-backs from blotchy stain or early peel.</p><hr><h2>Power washing VS — Video Guide</h2><blockquote>If you’re a visual learner, there’s a helpful walkthrough titled “Power washing VS Sanding Deck - See the difference!” that contrasts cleaning with cutting the surface. The host demonstrates required tools and a straightforward sequence to sand a deck so it looks renewed without heavy equipment. The takeaway matches field results: power washing cleans, but sanding is what resets the surface for even finishing.</blockquote><div class=video-embed style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden;border-radius:12px><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/2t1xNLjjqiY title="Power washing VS Sanding Deck -  See the difference!" frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%></iframe></div><p style=margin-top:.5rem;font-size:.95rem;opacity:.85>Video source: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t1xNLjjqiY" target=_blank rel="noopener nofollow">Power washing VS Sanding Deck - See the difference!</a></p><div class=equalle-product-link><p><a href=https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0CZ7VFK4N target=_blank>120 Grit Sandpaper Sheets (10-pack)</a> — 9x11 in Silicon Carbide Abrasive for Wet or Dry Use — Refines surfaces after coarse sanding by removing scratches from lower grits.

A light 80–100 grit sanding breaks mill glaze so stain can penetrate and adhere uniformly.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> What grit is best to remove mill glaze without over-polishing?<br><strong>A:</strong> Start at 80 grit to cut the glaze, then refine at 100 or 120. Avoid exceeding 120 on softwoods if using penetrating stains, as finer scratches can reduce uptake.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> Can I just pressure wash instead of sanding?<br><strong>A:</strong> Pressure washing cleans but often leaves the compressed fiber layer intact. It can also raise grain. For new boards, sanding is the most reliable way to remove mill glaze.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> How long after installation should I sand and stain?<br><strong>A:</strong> When the lumber’s surface moisture is below ~15% and weather allows a 24–48 hour cure window. That’s often a few weeks for kiln-dried-after-treatment, longer for wet PT lumber.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> Which sander and abrasives are most efficient?<br><strong>A:</strong> A 6-inch random orbit sander with dust extraction and open-coat aluminum oxide discs at 80–120 grit balances speed, surface temperature control, and even scratch patterns.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><div class=nko-tags-box><div class=nko-tags-line><span class=nko-label>Topics:</span><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://blog.equalle.com/tags/grit-80/>Grit-80</a></li><li><a href=https://blog.equalle.com/tags/grit-100/>Grit-100</a></li><li><a href=https://blog.equalle.com/tags/grit-120/>Grit-120</a></li><li><a href=https://blog.equalle.com/tags/deck-sanding/>Deck Sanding</a></li><li><a href=https://blog.equalle.com/tags/grit-progression/>Grit Progression</a></li><li><a href=https://blog.equalle.com/tags/dust-control/>Dust Control</a></li></ul></div></div></footer><section class=related-posts><h2>Related Posts</h2><div class=related-grid><a class=related-card href=https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/best-grit-for-deck-sanding-before-staining-deck-sanding/><div class=card-badge><span class=check></span>

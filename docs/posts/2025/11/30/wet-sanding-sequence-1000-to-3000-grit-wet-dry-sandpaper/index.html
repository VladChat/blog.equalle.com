You’ve taped off the washer nozzles, masked the edges, and laid out your gear like a surgeon. A foam block, a spray bottle with soapy water, microfiber towels, and a neat stack of wet dry sandpaper—1000, 2000, and 3000 grit—each sheet pre-cut and soaking. If you’ve ever stared at a hood that looked great at sunset but awful under the driveway floodlight—orange peel, dust nibs, faint sanding traces from an old repair—you know the itch to fix it properly. Today’s the day you turn that itch into an even, glassy finish with a controlled wet sanding sequence from 1000 to 3000 grit.</p><p>This isn’t about rushing in with a machine and crossing your fingers. It’s measured, tactile work—learning to read the slurry, feel the drag lighten as scratches level, and keep your passes consistent. A good clear coat has plenty of life in it, but not enough to waste. The right grit sequence does the heavy lifting with 1000, the refining with 2000, and the clarity tune-up with 3000, so your compound doesn’t have to work overtime—or leave you with haze you can’t polish out. Wet work is clean work: controlled cuts, cool surfaces, and predictable results.</p><p>If you’re new to this, I’ll walk you through the why and the how, including what I actually do on customer panels and my own projects. If you’re seasoned, this will feel like a checklist you’ve carried in your head for years—tightened up, no fluff, and full of the small adjustments that make the difference between “good” and “dead flat.” Either way, by the time you wipe your final IPA pass and see sharp reflections, you’ll know exactly why this sequence works—and how to repeat it.</p><figure class=brand-image><img src=https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/09.webp alt="Wet Dry Sandpaper: Master the 1000–3000 Grit Sequence — Sandpaper Sheets" loading=lazy decoding=async></figure><blockquote><p>Quick Summary: Use 1000 grit to level defects, 2000 grit to refine, and 3000 grit to pre-polish, all with controlled lubrication, light pressure, and disciplined inspection before compounding and protection.</p></blockquote><h2 id=why-these-grits-fix-what-you-see>Why These Grits Fix What You See</h2><p>Let’s translate surface defects into grit logic. Most of what offends your eye—orange peel texture, dust nibs, small runs, and prior sanding marks—are peaks and valleys in the clear coat. Your job is to lower the peaks just enough to meet the valleys, then refine the scratch pattern so it polishes cleanly.</p><ul><li>1000 grit: This is your leveling grit. It cuts quickly and flattens texture and nibs without you spending all day. It will leave a uniform, dull finish. Think of it as building the foundation: accurate, even, and flat. If you can still see isolated gloss after a few passes, your 1000 work isn’t done in that spot or you’re not contacting the surface evenly.</li><li>2000 grit: Your refiner. It erases the 1000-grit scratch while still keeping you honest about the surface shape. You’ll start to see a silky, uniform haze. This stage sets you up for a fast, low-risk polish.</li><li>3000 grit: The pre-polish. At this point, you’re not removing shape—just smoothing the scratch pattern so that your compound and pad barely need to bite. Done properly, 3000 will let you finish with a medium-cut compound and a microfiber or foam cutting pad in fewer passes, with less heat and less clear removed overall.</li></ul><p>The hidden hero here is consistency. If your 1000 work is patchy, you’re chasing it with 2000 and 3000 and never fully catching up. Most burn-throughs happen when someone tries to use 2000 or 3000 for shaping—too many passes, too much time—rather than committing to a controlled, brief cut at 1000. On factory clear coats that measure roughly 40–50 microns, you want every move to count. The sequence works because each stage does what it does best, then gets out of the way.</p><p>Actionable tips:</p><ul><li>Use a foam interface pad under your paper to keep contact even over curves.</li><li>Crosshatch your passes (0°/90°) and change direction with each grit so you can visually track when a previous scratch pattern is fully replaced.</li><li>Stop and squeegee often; if water masks your scratch pattern, you’re sanding blind.</li></ul><h2 id=setting-up-for-clean-controlled-wet-sanding>Setting Up for Clean, Controlled Wet Sanding</h2><p>Good results start before you touch the panel. Dust, poor lighting, and inconsistent lubrication cause more rework than bad technique. Set up your “wet workstation” right and you’ll save time, clear coat, and frustration.</p><ul><li>Lighting: Use bright, angled lighting—LED shop lights or a handheld swirl finder. You need to see texture and scratch orientation. Avoid direct sunlight; heat makes water evaporate and can warp your feedback.</li><li>Lubrication: A spray bottle with clean water and one small drop of pH-balanced car wash soap per quart is perfect. It keeps the paper cutting without loading, and it prevents stick-slip that causes pigtails. Keep a second bottle of plain water for rinsing.</li><li>Paper prep: Cut your wet/dry sheets into manageable sizes (1/3 or 1/4 sheets), then soak them 10–15 minutes to soften the backing. Stack them in order—1000, 2000, 3000—so you never reach for the wrong grit with wet fingers.</li><li>Block and backing: A soft foam block is non-negotiable on flat areas; fingers alone will dish the surface. On tight curves or near edges, add a thin interface pad or switch to a soft rubber block with rounded corners.</li><li>Masking and safety: Mask panel edges, emblems, and sharp body lines with high-tack tape. Wear nitrile gloves for grip. Keep clean microfibers nearby to squeegee and wipe.</li></ul><p>Here’s the move: wet the area, place the paper on the block, and let the paper float on a film of water—don’t press until the face is fully wet. Work in 12" x 12" sections. After 6–10 strokes, stop, squeegee with your towel, and inspect. If you see isolated gloss islands in a field of dullness, those are still-high spots—stay on 1000 until the entire section is uniformly dull. If you jump early, you’ll chase those islands with finer grits and risk over-thinning the clear around them.</p><p>Three setup habits that pay off:</p><ul><li>Keep a dedicated towel just for squeegeeing—never let it touch the ground.</li><li>Use a grease pencil to circle dust nibs; it helps you confirm they’re gone before moving on.</li><li>Rotate or flip your paper as soon as the cut falls off; a loaded sheet is false economy.</li></ul><h2 id=dialing-pressure-and-passes-with-wet-dry-sandpaper>Dialing Pressure and Passes With wet dry sandpaper</h2><p>Technique is where craftsmanship separates from guesswork. With wet dry sandpaper, your hands are your gauges—pressure, stroke length, and feedback through the block tell you when you’re done at each stage.</p><ul><li>Pressure: Think “two to three fingers of coffee mug weight.” If the paper skates without biting, add a touch more. If your block starts to plow or the slurry goes dark too quickly, you’re pressing too hard. Most panels respond best to light, even pressure with a steady tempo.</li><li>Stroke and cadence: Use medium-length strokes (6–8 inches), overlapping by about 50%. Work in a deliberate crosshatch pattern—horizontal passes, then vertical passes. This controlled change makes it easy to confirm when 2000 has erased the 1000 scratches.</li><li>Slurry reading: The milky slurry is your friend. At 1000 grit, it will load faster and darken as it removes material; when it lightens and the block glides more freely, you’ve likely knocked down the high spots. Rinse, inspect, and only then decide to do more.</li><li>Edge control: Edges and body lines are thin. Never run the block off a hard edge; stop short, rotate the block parallel to the edge, and feather with minimal pressure. Many techs double-tape body lines for a built-in safety bumper.</li></ul><p>If you see random deep scratches (pigtails), you’ve trapped grit—stop immediately. Rinse both the panel and paper thoroughly, wipe clean with your squeegee towel, and re-wet before you continue. Replace any sheet that looks contaminated or feels scratchy.</p><p>Time and pacing matter. On a 2&rsquo; x 2&rsquo; hood section, I’ll typically spend:</p><ul><li>2–4 minutes at 1000, inspecting every 30–45 seconds.</li><li>2–3 minutes at 2000 to fully replace the scratch pattern.</li><li>1–2 minutes at 3000 to pre-polish and “open up” for compound.</li></ul><p>The goal is never to “stay longer just to be sure.” It’s to do just enough at each grit so the next grit finishes the job without excess clear removal. Consistency beats bravery every time.</p><p><em>According to a <a href=https://equalle.com/blogs/grit-guides/restore-clear-coat-on-car-hood-with-320-1000-and-3000-grit-wet-sanding>article</a></em></p><figure class=brand-image><img src=https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/08.webp alt="Wet Dry Sandpaper: Master the 1000–3000 Grit Sequence — Sandpaper Sheets" loading=lazy decoding=async></figure><h2 id=from-1000-to-3000-the-step-by-step-sequence>From 1000 to 3000: The Step-by-Step Sequence</h2><p>Here’s the sequence I use on clear coat, from first pass to ready-to-polish. I’ll assume you’ve masked, pre-washed, clayed, and decontaminated the panel, and you’ve done a quick test spot to confirm you have enough clear to level.</p><p>H3: Stage 1 — 1000 Grit Leveling</p><ul><li>Lubricate generously and place 1000 grit on your foam-backed block.</li><li>Crosshatch: 6–8 horizontal passes, squeegee, inspect; then 6–8 vertical passes.</li><li>Look for uniform dullness. Any glossy islands are still high; repeat one more crosshatch.</li><li>Time-check: If a defect doesn’t move after two cycles, it may be deeper than you want to chase. Mark it, accept a minor remnant, and protect the surrounding clear.</li></ul><p>H3: Stage 2 — 2000 Grit Refining</p><ul><li>Rinse the area and switch to fresh 2000 grit.</li><li>Repeat the crosshatch with slightly lighter pressure. Your goal is to erase the 1000 pattern.</li><li>Visual cue: The 2000 finish should look smoother, less chalky. Under raking light, 1000 scratches run in your previous direction—don’t stop until they’re gone.</li><li>Edge and curve areas get one fewer pass. If you taped body lines, keep them taped through this stage.</li></ul><p>H3: Stage 3 — 3000 Grit Pre-Polish</p><ul><li>Switch to 3000 grit, ideally on a soft interface. This grit mainly “opens up” the surface.</li><li>Use long, light strokes; the slurry will be much finer and the panel will start to feel slick.</li><li>You’re done when the surface shows a uniform, satiny sheen with no visible linear scratches from prior grits.</li><li>Rinse and dry thoroughly. If you have compressed air, blow out mirror bases, vents, and panel gaps to prevent drips during polishing.</li></ul><p>Optional bridges:</p><ul><li>If your paint is on the softer side or your compound is mild, add a 2500 grit step.</li><li>On very hard clear (some German makes), you may benefit from an extra minute at 3000 or even a foam-backed 3000 disc to accelerate polishing.</li></ul><p>Practical checkpoints:</p><ul><li>After each grit, wipe dry and inspect under different angles of light.</li><li>Use a paint depth gauge when available; note readings before, during, and after. Your goal is minimal reduction with maximum flattening.</li><li>Never chase absolute perfection at the expense of film build near edges. Rounding a panel line reads as “wrong” from across the lot.</li></ul><h2 id=finishing-rinse-inspect-buff-protect>Finishing: Rinse, Inspect, Buff, Protect</h2><p>Wet sanding sets the stage; finishing locks in the shine. If you rush the final steps, you’ll leave clarity on the table—or worse, introduce swirls that hide all your careful leveling.</p><p>Compounding:</p><ul><li>Start with a microfiber cutting pad and a medium-cut compound. The 3000 stage lets you avoid the most aggressive products.</li><li>Prime the pad lightly, dab compound in four small drops, and spread at low speed before ramping up. Work a 16" x 16" area for 4–6 slow passes.</li><li>Wipe and inspect after each set. If haze lingers, two possibilities: either the 3000 wasn’t consistent, or your pad is gummed up. Clean the pad with compressed air or a brush, reapply a minimal amount of compound, and try one more set.</li></ul><p>Polishing:</p><ul><li>Switch to a soft foam finishing pad with a fine polish. Work at moderate speed and minimal pressure. You’re not cutting now—you’re refining.</li><li>IPA wipe-down (diluted is fine) between steps removes fillers and shows you the true finish.</li></ul><p>Protection:</p><ul><li>Seal it. A ceramic spray, sealant, or high-quality wax will protect your work and make maintenance easier. Freshly corrected paint loves clean microfibers—use plush towels and fold frequently to avoid re-marring.</li><li>Final inspection under multiple light sources—shop lights, sunlight, even your phone’s LED—confirms clarity.</li></ul><p>Maintenance tips after correction:</p><ul><li>Two-bucket hand washes with a fresh wash mitt to preserve the finish.</li><li>Dry with a blower or clean drying towels; avoid dragging dirt across the surface.</li><li>If a nib or scuff appears later, spot-sand locally using the same 1000 → 2000 → 3000 mini-sequence instead of redoing the whole panel.</li></ul><p>Three finish-line habits that elevate results:</p><ul><li>Keep pad rotation healthy; if the machine bogs, you’re pushing too hard or the pad is spent.</li><li>Work cool.

While it’s about edge sharpening, the takeaway is universal: controlled water lubrication, steady pressure, and consistent grit progression beat brute force every time. Watching the slurry form and the feedback change mirrors exactly what you’ll feel on a car panel.</blockquote><div class=video-embed style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden;border-radius:12px><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/oqdGUPWN64c title="Sharpening, Japanese whetstone vs wet & dry sandpaper" frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%></iframe></div><p style=margin-top:.5rem;font-size:.95rem;opacity:.85>Video source: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdGUPWN64c" target=_blank rel="noopener nofollow">Sharpening, Japanese whetstone vs wet & dry sandpaper</a></p><div class=equalle-product-link><p><a href=https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07RLQ4JWR target=_blank>400 Grit Sandpaper Sheets (100-pack)</a> — 9x11 in Silicon Carbide Abrasive for Wet or Dry Use — Ultra-fine abrasive for refining surfaces before polishing or coating.

For most users, a quick 2000 stage is faster and safer, delivering a cleaner, easier polish.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> How do I avoid burning through edges?<br><strong>A:</strong> Double-tape body lines, reduce pressure near edges, and never let the block roll off an edge. Treat edges with one fewer pass at each grit and approach them parallel with minimal pressure.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> What lubricant works best for wet sanding?<br><strong>A:</strong> Clean water with a tiny amount of pH-neutral car wash soap provides glide without foaming. Keep a second bottle of plain water for rinsing away slurry between passes.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> How do I know when to stop with 1000 grit?<br><strong>A:</strong> When the entire section is uniformly dull with no glossy islands under raking light. Squeegee frequently; if you’re still seeing isolated gloss, keep leveling with 1000 before moving up.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> Which pad and compound should I use after 3000?<br><strong>A:</strong> Start with a microfiber cutting pad and a medium-cut compound; refine with a soft foam pad and finishing polish. On very hard clear, you may need a slightly stronger compound, but the 3000 stage usually keeps it simple.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><div class=nko-tags-box><div class=nko-tags-line><span class=nko-label>Topics:</span><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://blog.equalle.com/tags/grit-400/>Grit-400</a></li><li><a href=https://blog.equalle.com/tags/grit-1000/>Grit-1000</a></li><li><a href=https://blog.equalle.com/tags/grit-2000/>Grit-2000</a></li><li><a href=https://blog.equalle.com/tags/grit-2500/>Grit-2500</a></li><li><a href=https://blog.equalle.com/tags/grit-3000/>Grit-3000</a></li><li><a href=https://blog.equalle.com/tags/wet-sanding/>Wet Sanding</a></li><li><a href=https://blog.equalle.com/tags/clear-coat/>Clear Coat</a></li><li><a href=https://blog.equalle.com/tags/dry-sanding/>Dry Sanding</a></li></ul></div></div></footer><section class=related-posts><h2>Related Posts</h2><div class=related-grid><a class=related-card href=https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/29/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding/><div class=card-badge><span class=check></span>

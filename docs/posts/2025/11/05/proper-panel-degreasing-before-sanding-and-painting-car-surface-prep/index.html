That’s the moment I love most: quiet, focused, and full of possibility. You tape off the trim, set your DA sander on the cart, and reach for a clean set of nitrile gloves. If you’ve ever laid down a base coat only to watch it crater into fisheyes or peel at the edges, you know the pain of skipping a step in car surface prep. Most of the time the culprit isn’t your gun, your paint, or the weather—it’s contamination that never should have made it to the paint stage.</p><p>I learned this the hard way on a black hood that looked perfect under shop lights, right up until I shot the first pass. Tiny moons opened everywhere the previous owner’s wax had lingered. I had sanded first, thinking I’d “clean it later.” That just drove the wax deeper. I stripped it, humbled, and changed my sequence forever: wash, degrease, then sand, not the other way around. If there’s one truth I can pass on, it’s that proper panel degreasing before sanding and painting is the start of every successful job—whether you’re refreshing an old pickup or doing a full color change on a show build. When you handle it with the same care you give your paint mix, your results stop being hit-or-miss and start becoming reproducible.</p><p>So take a breath, slow the day down, and do the work that no one sees. The shine you’ll get later is born in the wipe-down you do right now.</p><figure class=brand-image><img src=https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/28.webp alt="Car Surface Prep: Proper Panel Degreasing — Sandpaper Sheets" loading=lazy decoding=async></figure><blockquote><p>Quick Summary: Degrease first, then sand, then degrease again—using the right solvent, clean towels, and a two-rag wipe technique—to prevent fisheyes and ensure long-lasting adhesion.</p></blockquote><h2 id=why-degreasing-comes-first>Why degreasing comes first</h2><p>Sanding is a cutter—it moves material, but it doesn’t neutralize contamination. If a panel has wax, silicone, road tar, diesel mist, hand lotion, or even aerosol silicone from a nearby detail job, your sandpaper smears those contaminants into the scratches you’re creating. Later, primer and base try to grab those contaminated scratch-walls and fail. That’s why you often see fisheyes, crows-feet around edges, or mysterious delamination months down the road.</p><p>Degreasing first does three things. One, it lifts oils and silicones to the surface so you can capture them in a towel before they flash back into the panel. Two, it keeps sanding dust clean—uncontaminated dust is easier to remove and less likely to re-stick. Three, it exposes the truth; when the panel is truly clean, you can see remaining defects, poor bodywork, and pinholes you’d have missed through the haze.</p><p>Sequence matters. My baseline process goes like this:</p><ul><li>Wash the panel with a wax-free soap to remove loose dirt.</li><li>Initial solvent wipe (solvent or waterborne, depending on substrate).</li><li>Sand to your target profile.</li><li>Blow off with filtered, dry air; vacuum and brush out seams.</li><li>Final cleaner wipe and tack-rag before primer or sealer.</li></ul><p>Temperature matters, too. If your panel is cold (or much warmer than the room), cleaners won’t flash evenly and can trap residue. Aim for 65–80°F panel temperature and low humidity. Wear clean nitrile gloves from start to finish; bare hands reintroduce oils faster than you think. And work top to bottom—gravity is real, and you want contaminants moving off the panel, not into fresh areas you just wiped.</p><p>One more reality check: the nastiest contamination usually lives in edges and seams—door handles, mirror mounts, molding channels. Open those up and degrease inside, or you’ll drag hidden grime across a perfect door skin with your first sanding pass.</p><h2 id=solvent-choices-for-car-surface-prep>Solvent choices for car surface prep</h2><p>The cleaner you choose should match both the stage of work and the substrate. In the broadest terms, you’ll reach for two families of products: solvent-based wax and grease removers and waterborne surface cleaners.</p><p>Use a solvent-based cleaner on raw metal, cured 2K primer, and heavily contaminated pre-finish panels. These products dissolve waxes, oils, tar, and silicone. Apply with a soaked wipe and immediately follow with a dry, clean towel before the solvent flashes—this is the two-rag method. The goal is float-and-capture: wet rag lifts contamination, dry rag captures it. If you let the solvent evaporate on its own, you simply redistribute contaminants as a thin film.</p><p>Use a waterborne cleaner on sanded OEM finishes, plastic bumpers, and as a final wipe before base coat—especially if you’re spraying a waterborne base. Waterborne cleaners are fantastic at breaking surface tension and lifting water-soluble grime like sweat, soda, or finger oils without swelling existing finishes.</p><p>A few hard rules from the bench:</p><ul><li>Avoid household degreasers, dish soaps with “shine enhancers,” and anything silicone-laced.</li><li>Go easy with acetone and lacquer thinner; they’re aggressive and can soften existing coatings or trap residue.</li><li>Mineral spirits leave an oily film; not ideal for paint prep.</li><li>1:1 or 2:1 distilled water to isopropyl alcohol (70–91%) makes a good, fast final wipe for stubborn fingerprinting—test first.</li></ul><p>Actionable tips:</p><ul><li>Label your towels “wet” and “dry.” If you mix them, you’re just pushing dirt around.</li><li>Switch towels often; one panel can take 2–4 pairs, especially on a waxed vehicle.</li><li>Keep a dedicated squeegee or clean plastic spreader to gently scrape sap or tar after soaking with cleaner.</li><li>If a panel beads water after cleaning, it still has wax—repeat the process.</li></ul><p><em>According to a <a href=http://www.spiuserforum.com/index.php?threads/the-proper-way-to-wipe-down-a-vehicle-prior-to-paint.6622/>article</a></em>, thorough washing and the correct wipe-down sequence dramatically reduce rework by preventing sanding scum and embedded contamination. I’ve seen the same: the time you spend cleaning is the time you don’t spend fixing fisheyes.</p><h2 id=degrease-sand-degrease-my-shop-workflow>Degrease, sand, degrease: my shop workflow</h2><p>Here’s the exact process I teach apprentices when we’re chasing dependable adhesion and a flawless finish.</p><ol><li>Initial wash</li></ol><ul><li>Use a wax-free automotive soap and warm water.</li><li>Rinse thoroughly and blow water out of seams with dry, filtered air.</li></ul><ol start=2><li>First degrease</li></ol><ul><li>Put on fresh nitrile gloves.</li><li>Choose solvent or waterborne cleaner based on substrate.</li><li>Two-rag method: soak-wipe a 2’x2’ area, then immediately dry-wipe.

It shows lows, pinholes, and scratch patterns you can’t feel.</li></ul><ol start=5><li>Dust control</li></ol><ul><li>Vacuum panels and stands; blow out seams again with clean, dry air.</li><li>Wipe the shop cart, air hose, and spray gun body—dust rides everywhere.</li></ul><ol start=6><li>Second degrease (critical)</li></ol><ul><li>After sanding, repeat the two-rag wipe-down.

One burst of silicone in the air can ruin your next three paint jobs.</p><figure class=brand-image><img src=https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/27.webp alt="Car Surface Prep: Proper Panel Degreasing — Sandpaper Sheets" loading=lazy decoding=async></figure><h2 id=control-dust-humidity-and-touch-points>Control dust, humidity, and touch points</h2><p>Panel degreasing is only as good as the environment it lives in. Dust, moisture, and fingerprints are silent saboteurs, and they show up right when your base coat is laying out perfect.</p><p>Start with air quality. If your compressor spits water, you’re atomizing contamination right at the panel. Use a multi-stage filtration system with a desiccant dryer near the gun and a separator at the tank. Bleed tanks daily. If you blow off panels with oily shop air, you’ve undone all of your car surface prep in five seconds.</p><p>Next, manage humidity and temperature. Solvent and waterborne cleaners behave differently across climates. In high humidity, slow-evaporating solvent cleaners can smear; in low humidity, they flash so fast you can’t capture the contamination in time. Adjust your dwell time—apply, wait a few seconds to float the grime, then wipe dry before flashing. Keep panels between 65–80°F and avoid wiping a cold car pulled straight in from the winter street; condensation will form and trap contaminants.</p><p>Control touch points. From the moment you clean a panel, it’s a no-touch zone. Use panel stands and edge guards. Assign one person to handle cleaned panels if you’re working in a team, and make glove discipline non-negotiable. I keep a fresh box of nitriles by the door; anyone who enters the prep area must glove up.</p><p>Finally, think like dust. Ceiling fan? Off. Doorway to the wood shop? Closed. Tool cart towels? Replace them before they become dust movers. Good lighting is part of cleanliness—use a high-CRI handheld light to scan the panel at shallow angles. You’ll catch smeared edges, residue halos, and stray sanding scratches before they turn into paint flaws. Two minutes with a light now beats hours of color-sanding later.</p><p>Actionable tips:</p><ul><li>Dedicate one cart as “clean-only”—no grinding discs, no lubes, just wipes, towels, and tape.</li><li>Purge air hoses before spraying or blowing off; point away from the car for the first blast.</li><li>Store fresh towels in sealed bags; open only what you’ll use in one session.</li><li>If you must pause, re-wipe high-touch zones (handles, edges) before sealing.</li></ul><hr><h2>How To Prep — Video Guide</h2><blockquote>In this segment from Eastwood’s Hands-On Cars, Kevin Tetz walks through the nuts and bolts of getting a car ready for base and clear.

Degrease first to avoid grinding contaminants into the surface, then sand, and degrease again to remove sanding residue and any oils picked up during handling. Finish with a tack wipe before sealer or base.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> What’s the best cleaner for panels before paint?<br><strong>A:</strong> Use a solvent-based wax and grease remover on raw metal, cured primers, and heavy contamination; use a waterborne cleaner on sanded OEM finishes and as a final wipe. For stubborn fingerprints, a 1:1 distilled water to isopropyl alcohol mix works well—test first.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> Can I just use dish soap and water?<br><strong>A:</strong> A wax-free automotive soap is fine for the initial wash, but it won’t dissolve silicone, wax, or tar. You still need a proper wax and grease remover to float and capture those contaminants before sanding and before paint.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> How long should I wait after wiping with cleaner before painting?<br><strong>A:</strong> After the dry towel pass, let the panel flash completely—usually a few minutes at room temperature. If you see smearing or beading, repeat the process.

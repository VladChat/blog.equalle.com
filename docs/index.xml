&lt;p&gt;The garage is quiet except for the hum of an overhead light and the soft grit-on-clearcoat whisper from a half-used sheet of polishing sandpaper. You’ve taped your edges, dialed in the work light, and set a microfibre towel neatly across the fender. Under diffused lighting the finish looks clean, but tilt the panel toward a harsh LED and the surface blooms with holograms—pinwheel arcs that betray rushed prep, mismatched abrasives, or a pad that was a little too warm for a little too long. It’s frustrating because the underlying paint is healthy and thick; you’ve done the right passes, but the micro-marring remains.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/02.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/18/reduce-swirl-marks-during-polishing-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/reduce-swirl-marks-during-polishing-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/18/reduce-swirl-marks-during-polishing-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/reduce-swirl-marks-during-polishing-polishing-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/18/reduce-swirl-marks-during-polishing-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/reduce-swirl-marks-during-polishing-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/18/reduce-swirl-marks-during-polishing-polishing-sandpaper/cards/instagram/reduce-swirl-marks-during-polishing-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/18/reduce-swirl-marks-during-polishing-polishing-sandpaper/cards/instagram/reduce-swirl-marks-during-polishing-polishing-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/18/reduce-swirl-marks-during-polishing-polishing-sandpaper/cards/instagram/reduce-swirl-marks-during-polishing-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/18/reduce-swirl-marks-during-polishing-polishing-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/reduce-swirl-marks-during-polishing-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/18/reduce-swirl-marks-during-polishing-polishing-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/reduce-swirl-marks-during-polishing-polishing-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/18/reduce-swirl-marks-during-polishing-polishing-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/reduce-swirl-marks-during-polishing-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/18/reduce-swirl-marks-during-polishing-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/reduce-swirl-marks-during-polishing-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/18/reduce-swirl-marks-during-polishing-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/reduce-swirl-marks-during-polishing-polishing-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/18/reduce-swirl-marks-during-polishing-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/reduce-swirl-marks-during-polishing-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Identify Raised Nibs Before Sanding</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/17/identify-raised-nibs-before-sanding-between-coats-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/17/identify-raised-nibs-before-sanding-between-coats-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jan 2026 14:58:48 +0000</pubDate><category>Between-Coats Sanding</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>dry sanding</category><category>orbital sander</category><description>Learn to identify raised nibs before sanding between coats for flawless finishes.

&lt;p&gt;You set the brush down and step back. The tabletop glows under the shop lights, a fresh coat catching reflections like still water. Then you see them—tiny flecks interrupting the gloss, little bumps that snag your eye and threaten the silky-smooth finish you pictured. They’re not big flaws, just dust nibs and bits of raised grain, but you know the truth: if you sand them wrong, you’ll chase scratches, burn through edges, or trap grit that will telegraph through every coat after. The difference between good and truly great finishes often comes down to what we do before we reach for sandpaper.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/29.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/17/identify-raised-nibs-before-sanding-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/identify-raised-nibs-before-sanding-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/17/identify-raised-nibs-before-sanding-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/identify-raised-nibs-before-sanding-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/17/identify-raised-nibs-before-sanding-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/identify-raised-nibs-before-sanding-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/17/identify-raised-nibs-before-sanding-between-coats-sanding/cards/instagram/identify-raised-nibs-before-sanding-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/17/identify-raised-nibs-before-sanding-between-coats-sanding/cards/instagram/identify-raised-nibs-before-sanding-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/17/identify-raised-nibs-before-sanding-between-coats-sanding/cards/instagram/identify-raised-nibs-before-sanding-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/17/identify-raised-nibs-before-sanding-between-coats-sanding/cards/pinterest/identify-raised-nibs-before-sanding-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/17/identify-raised-nibs-before-sanding-between-coats-sanding/cards/pinterest/identify-raised-nibs-before-sanding-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/17/identify-raised-nibs-before-sanding-between-coats-sanding/cards/pinterest/identify-raised-nibs-before-sanding-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/17/identify-raised-nibs-before-sanding-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/identify-raised-nibs-before-sanding-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/17/identify-raised-nibs-before-sanding-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/identify-raised-nibs-before-sanding-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/17/identify-raised-nibs-before-sanding-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/identify-raised-nibs-before-sanding-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Clean And Degrease Surfaces Before Sanding And Priming</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/17/clean-and-degrease-surfaces-before-sanding-and-priming-surface-preparation/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/17/clean-and-degrease-surfaces-before-sanding-and-priming-surface-preparation/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jan 2026 13:34:08 +0000</pubDate><category>Paint Removal &amp; Surface Prep</category><category>paint prep</category><category>rust removal</category><category>primer coat</category><category>sanding block</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><description>Clean, degrease, then sand and prime like a pro.

&lt;p&gt;Saturday mornings in my shop start the same way: coffee steaming on the bench, drop cloths folded like fresh sails, and that itch to make something look and feel right. I’ve seen perfect paint jobs fail on day two because the prep was rushed. I’ve also watched tired cabinets come back to life simply because we took cleaning seriously. That’s the unglamorous truth of surface preparation: it separates the projects you brag about from the ones you avoid eye contact with.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/27.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/17/clean-and-degrease-surfaces-before-sanding-and-priming-surface-preparation/cards/facebook/clean-and-degrease-surfaces-before-sanding-and-priming-surface-preparation.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/17/clean-and-degrease-surfaces-before-sanding-and-priming-surface-preparation/cards/facebook/clean-and-degrease-surfaces-before-sanding-and-priming-surface-preparation.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/17/clean-and-degrease-surfaces-before-sanding-and-priming-surface-preparation/cards/facebook/clean-and-degrease-surfaces-before-sanding-and-priming-surface-preparation.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/17/clean-and-degrease-surfaces-before-sanding-and-priming-surface-preparation/cards/instagram/clean-and-degrease-surfaces-before-sanding-and-priming-surface-preparation.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/17/clean-and-degrease-surfaces-before-sanding-and-priming-surface-preparation/cards/instagram/clean-and-degrease-surfaces-before-sanding-and-priming-surface-preparation.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/17/clean-and-degrease-surfaces-before-sanding-and-priming-surface-preparation/cards/instagram/clean-and-degrease-surfaces-before-sanding-and-priming-surface-preparation.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/17/clean-and-degrease-surfaces-before-sanding-and-priming-surface-preparation/cards/pinterest/clean-and-degrease-surfaces-before-sanding-and-priming-surface-preparation.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/17/clean-and-degrease-surfaces-before-sanding-and-priming-surface-preparation/cards/pinterest/clean-and-degrease-surfaces-before-sanding-and-priming-surface-preparation.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/17/clean-and-degrease-surfaces-before-sanding-and-priming-surface-preparation/cards/pinterest/clean-and-degrease-surfaces-before-sanding-and-priming-surface-preparation.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/17/clean-and-degrease-surfaces-before-sanding-and-priming-surface-preparation/cards/facebook/clean-and-degrease-surfaces-before-sanding-and-priming-surface-preparation.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/17/clean-and-degrease-surfaces-before-sanding-and-priming-surface-preparation/cards/facebook/clean-and-degrease-surfaces-before-sanding-and-priming-surface-preparation.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/17/clean-and-degrease-surfaces-before-sanding-and-priming-surface-preparation/cards/facebook/clean-and-degrease-surfaces-before-sanding-and-priming-surface-preparation.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Set Up Polishing Wheels Without Cross Contamination</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/16/set-up-polishing-wheels-without-cross-contamination-metal-polishing/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/16/set-up-polishing-wheels-without-cross-contamination-metal-polishing/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 13:43:54 +0000</pubDate><category>Metal Polishing &amp; Rust Repair</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>metal polishing</category><category>dust control</category><description>Engineer-tested guide to set up polishing wheels without cross-contamination in metal polishing, including compounds, speeds, storage, and cleaning.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="metal-polishing-set-up-wheels-without-contamination"&gt;Metal Polishing: Set Up Wheels Without Contamination&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Late on a Saturday, the shop is quiet except for the hum of a bench grinder. The first pass on a stainless bracket looks promising—deep scratches erased, geometry still crisp. You switch to a softer buff, strobe the rim with a stick of green compound, and lean in. Then it happens: faint, spiraling hairlines that catch the raking light. You back off and try again, softer pressure, fresh angle. The lines remain—ghosts you can’t unsee. Something, somewhere, jumped the fence. If you’ve spent hours chasing a mirror only to be ambushed at the final inch, you’ve likely fallen victim to the invisible enemy of metal polishing: cross contamination.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/25.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/16/set-up-polishing-wheels-without-cross-contamination-metal-polishing/cards/facebook/set-up-polishing-wheels-without-cross-contamination-metal-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/16/set-up-polishing-wheels-without-cross-contamination-metal-polishing/cards/facebook/set-up-polishing-wheels-without-cross-contamination-metal-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/16/set-up-polishing-wheels-without-cross-contamination-metal-polishing/cards/facebook/set-up-polishing-wheels-without-cross-contamination-metal-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/16/set-up-polishing-wheels-without-cross-contamination-metal-polishing/cards/instagram/set-up-polishing-wheels-without-cross-contamination-metal-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/16/set-up-polishing-wheels-without-cross-contamination-metal-polishing/cards/instagram/set-up-polishing-wheels-without-cross-contamination-metal-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/16/set-up-polishing-wheels-without-cross-contamination-metal-polishing/cards/instagram/set-up-polishing-wheels-without-cross-contamination-metal-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/16/set-up-polishing-wheels-without-cross-contamination-metal-polishing/cards/pinterest/set-up-polishing-wheels-without-cross-contamination-metal-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/16/set-up-polishing-wheels-without-cross-contamination-metal-polishing/cards/pinterest/set-up-polishing-wheels-without-cross-contamination-metal-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/16/set-up-polishing-wheels-without-cross-contamination-metal-polishing/cards/pinterest/set-up-polishing-wheels-without-cross-contamination-metal-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/16/set-up-polishing-wheels-without-cross-contamination-metal-polishing/cards/facebook/set-up-polishing-wheels-without-cross-contamination-metal-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/16/set-up-polishing-wheels-without-cross-contamination-metal-polishing/cards/facebook/set-up-polishing-wheels-without-cross-contamination-metal-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/16/set-up-polishing-wheels-without-cross-contamination-metal-polishing/cards/facebook/set-up-polishing-wheels-without-cross-contamination-metal-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>How Long To Soak Wet Dry Papers Before Lens Sanding</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/15/how-long-to-soak-wet-dry-papers-before-lens-sanding-lens-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/15/how-long-to-soak-wet-dry-papers-before-lens-sanding-lens-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 17:04:07 +0000</pubDate><category>Headlight Restoration</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>clear coat</category><category>grit progression</category><category>wet sanding</category><description>Learn precise soak times for wet-dry papers before lens sanding, plus pro tips on abrasives, lubrication, grit progression, and workflow for clear results.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="how-long-to-soak-wet-dry-paper-for-lens-sanding"&gt;How Long to Soak Wet-Dry Paper for Lens Sanding&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first time you watch dusk turn your road into a tunnel of glare, you realize how much clarity lives in the small things. Haze, pitting, and a cataract-like film build slowly on headlight lenses until the world looks permanently overexposed. You pull into the garage, set a bucket by the bumper, and stare at a stack of wet-dry papers—silicon carbide sheets curling slightly at the edges. You’ve polished paint before, maybe even cut orange peel out of clear coat, but lenses are different. They’re optically functional components. Every scratch you leave behind scatters photons that should have stayed focused on the road. This is why prep matters. And one deceptively simple choice—how long to soak wet-dry papers before lens sanding—will decide whether you cut cleanly with predictable scratch geometry or fight galling, loading, and inconsistent finish all evening.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/23.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/15/how-long-to-soak-wet-dry-papers-before-lens-sanding-lens-sanding/cards/facebook/how-long-to-soak-wet-dry-papers-before-lens-sanding-lens-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/15/how-long-to-soak-wet-dry-papers-before-lens-sanding-lens-sanding/cards/facebook/how-long-to-soak-wet-dry-papers-before-lens-sanding-lens-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/15/how-long-to-soak-wet-dry-papers-before-lens-sanding-lens-sanding/cards/facebook/how-long-to-soak-wet-dry-papers-before-lens-sanding-lens-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/15/how-long-to-soak-wet-dry-papers-before-lens-sanding-lens-sanding/cards/instagram/how-long-to-soak-wet-dry-papers-before-lens-sanding-lens-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/15/how-long-to-soak-wet-dry-papers-before-lens-sanding-lens-sanding/cards/instagram/how-long-to-soak-wet-dry-papers-before-lens-sanding-lens-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/15/how-long-to-soak-wet-dry-papers-before-lens-sanding-lens-sanding/cards/instagram/how-long-to-soak-wet-dry-papers-before-lens-sanding-lens-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/15/how-long-to-soak-wet-dry-papers-before-lens-sanding-lens-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-long-to-soak-wet-dry-papers-before-lens-sanding-lens-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/15/how-long-to-soak-wet-dry-papers-before-lens-sanding-lens-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-long-to-soak-wet-dry-papers-before-lens-sanding-lens-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/15/how-long-to-soak-wet-dry-papers-before-lens-sanding-lens-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-long-to-soak-wet-dry-papers-before-lens-sanding-lens-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/15/how-long-to-soak-wet-dry-papers-before-lens-sanding-lens-sanding/cards/facebook/how-long-to-soak-wet-dry-papers-before-lens-sanding-lens-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/15/how-long-to-soak-wet-dry-papers-before-lens-sanding-lens-sanding/cards/facebook/how-long-to-soak-wet-dry-papers-before-lens-sanding-lens-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/15/how-long-to-soak-wet-dry-papers-before-lens-sanding-lens-sanding/cards/facebook/how-long-to-soak-wet-dry-papers-before-lens-sanding-lens-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Flatten Texture Without Exposing Basecoat On High Spots</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/15/flatten-texture-without-exposing-basecoat-on-high-spots-clear-coat-leveling/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/15/flatten-texture-without-exposing-basecoat-on-high-spots-clear-coat-leveling/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 15:40:14 +0000</pubDate><category>Wet Sanding Clear Coat</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>clear coat</category><category>mirror finish</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>Learn how to flatten clear coat texture without burning through the base.

&lt;p&gt;You know the moment: the car looks incredible under garage lights, glossy and deep. But then you pull into bright midday sun and see the texture—orange peel, a few dust nibs, maybe a mild wave on a hood that deserves to be glass-smooth. Your stomach drops. You want that mirror finish, yet the fear of sanding through the high spots into basecoat is real. It’s not just about shine; it’s about preserving the integrity (and value) of the paint system. That’s where clear coat leveling comes in—methodical, careful, and entirely achievable with the right approach.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/21.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/15/flatten-texture-without-exposing-basecoat-on-high-spots-clear-coat-leveling/cards/facebook/flatten-texture-without-exposing-basecoat-on-high-spots-clear-coat-leveling.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/15/flatten-texture-without-exposing-basecoat-on-high-spots-clear-coat-leveling/cards/facebook/flatten-texture-without-exposing-basecoat-on-high-spots-clear-coat-leveling.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/15/flatten-texture-without-exposing-basecoat-on-high-spots-clear-coat-leveling/cards/facebook/flatten-texture-without-exposing-basecoat-on-high-spots-clear-coat-leveling.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/15/flatten-texture-without-exposing-basecoat-on-high-spots-clear-coat-leveling/cards/instagram/flatten-texture-without-exposing-basecoat-on-high-spots-clear-coat-leveling.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/15/flatten-texture-without-exposing-basecoat-on-high-spots-clear-coat-leveling/cards/instagram/flatten-texture-without-exposing-basecoat-on-high-spots-clear-coat-leveling.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/15/flatten-texture-without-exposing-basecoat-on-high-spots-clear-coat-leveling/cards/instagram/flatten-texture-without-exposing-basecoat-on-high-spots-clear-coat-leveling.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/15/flatten-texture-without-exposing-basecoat-on-high-spots-clear-coat-leveling/cards/pinterest/flatten-texture-without-exposing-basecoat-on-high-spots-clear-coat-leveling.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/15/flatten-texture-without-exposing-basecoat-on-high-spots-clear-coat-leveling/cards/pinterest/flatten-texture-without-exposing-basecoat-on-high-spots-clear-coat-leveling.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/15/flatten-texture-without-exposing-basecoat-on-high-spots-clear-coat-leveling/cards/pinterest/flatten-texture-without-exposing-basecoat-on-high-spots-clear-coat-leveling.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/15/flatten-texture-without-exposing-basecoat-on-high-spots-clear-coat-leveling/cards/facebook/flatten-texture-without-exposing-basecoat-on-high-spots-clear-coat-leveling.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/15/flatten-texture-without-exposing-basecoat-on-high-spots-clear-coat-leveling/cards/facebook/flatten-texture-without-exposing-basecoat-on-high-spots-clear-coat-leveling.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/15/flatten-texture-without-exposing-basecoat-on-high-spots-clear-coat-leveling/cards/facebook/flatten-texture-without-exposing-basecoat-on-high-spots-clear-coat-leveling.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>How To Feather Edge Old Paint Without Visible Steps</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/15/how-to-feather-edge-old-paint-without-visible-steps-auto-body-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/15/how-to-feather-edge-old-paint-without-visible-steps-auto-body-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 13:46:07 +0000</pubDate><category>Auto Body Sanding</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit progression</category><category>sanding block</category><category>dust control</category><description>Learn feather edging without steps.

&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning, the garage is cool and quiet except for the soft hiss of the compressor winding down and the rattle of a block sander in my hand. The old pickup in front of me has stories baked into every panel—sun-faded lacquer, a few driveway dings, and a repair line from years ago that catches the light like a ridge on a map. If you’ve ever repainted a panel only to see a ghost ring around your repair, you know the sting. You steal a glance sideways under the shop light and there it is—the “step.” That’s the moment when real craftsmanship starts. The difference between an amateur patch and a pro-level finish often comes down to feather edging: the controlled, patient art of tapering layers of old paint so the transition becomes invisible. This is the heart of auto body sanding—hands, eyes, and feel coming together—where you earn that invisible blend long before the spray gun ever leaves the rack.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/19.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/15/how-to-feather-edge-old-paint-without-visible-steps-auto-body-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-feather-edge-old-paint-without-visible-steps-auto-body-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/15/how-to-feather-edge-old-paint-without-visible-steps-auto-body-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-feather-edge-old-paint-without-visible-steps-auto-body-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/15/how-to-feather-edge-old-paint-without-visible-steps-auto-body-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-feather-edge-old-paint-without-visible-steps-auto-body-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/15/how-to-feather-edge-old-paint-without-visible-steps-auto-body-sanding/cards/instagram/how-to-feather-edge-old-paint-without-visible-steps-auto-body-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/15/how-to-feather-edge-old-paint-without-visible-steps-auto-body-sanding/cards/instagram/how-to-feather-edge-old-paint-without-visible-steps-auto-body-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/15/how-to-feather-edge-old-paint-without-visible-steps-auto-body-sanding/cards/instagram/how-to-feather-edge-old-paint-without-visible-steps-auto-body-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/15/how-to-feather-edge-old-paint-without-visible-steps-auto-body-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-to-feather-edge-old-paint-without-visible-steps-auto-body-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/15/how-to-feather-edge-old-paint-without-visible-steps-auto-body-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-to-feather-edge-old-paint-without-visible-steps-auto-body-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/15/how-to-feather-edge-old-paint-without-visible-steps-auto-body-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-to-feather-edge-old-paint-without-visible-steps-auto-body-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/15/how-to-feather-edge-old-paint-without-visible-steps-auto-body-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-feather-edge-old-paint-without-visible-steps-auto-body-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/15/how-to-feather-edge-old-paint-without-visible-steps-auto-body-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-feather-edge-old-paint-without-visible-steps-auto-body-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/15/how-to-feather-edge-old-paint-without-visible-steps-auto-body-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-feather-edge-old-paint-without-visible-steps-auto-body-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Remove Mill Glaze From New Deck Boards By Sanding</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/14/remove-mill-glaze-from-new-deck-boards-by-sanding-deck-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/14/remove-mill-glaze-from-new-deck-boards-by-sanding-deck-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 13:45:47 +0000</pubDate><category>Floor &amp; Deck Sanding</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>deck sanding</category><category>grit progression</category><category>dust control</category><description>Engineer-tested guide to deck sanding for removing mill glaze on new boards.

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve ever watched fresh rain bead up and roll off a brand-new deck, you’ve seen the surface behave like a waxed car. It looks healthy and waterproof, right up to the moment you try to stain it and the finish flashes unevenly, blotches, or peels in sheets. That isn’t a failure of the stain. It’s the result of mill glaze—an artifact from planing at the mill where knives compress fibers, heat softens lignin, and resins are smeared across the surface, creating a semi-burnished shell. The surest fix is precise, methodical deck sanding. Not a token pass, but a controlled removal of that top layer so finish can mechanically anchor and wick into pores as the manufacturer intended.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/17.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/14/remove-mill-glaze-from-new-deck-boards-by-sanding-deck-sanding/cards/facebook/remove-mill-glaze-from-new-deck-boards-by-sanding-deck-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/14/remove-mill-glaze-from-new-deck-boards-by-sanding-deck-sanding/cards/facebook/remove-mill-glaze-from-new-deck-boards-by-sanding-deck-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/14/remove-mill-glaze-from-new-deck-boards-by-sanding-deck-sanding/cards/facebook/remove-mill-glaze-from-new-deck-boards-by-sanding-deck-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/14/remove-mill-glaze-from-new-deck-boards-by-sanding-deck-sanding/cards/instagram/remove-mill-glaze-from-new-deck-boards-by-sanding-deck-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/14/remove-mill-glaze-from-new-deck-boards-by-sanding-deck-sanding/cards/instagram/remove-mill-glaze-from-new-deck-boards-by-sanding-deck-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/14/remove-mill-glaze-from-new-deck-boards-by-sanding-deck-sanding/cards/instagram/remove-mill-glaze-from-new-deck-boards-by-sanding-deck-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/14/remove-mill-glaze-from-new-deck-boards-by-sanding-deck-sanding/cards/pinterest/remove-mill-glaze-from-new-deck-boards-by-sanding-deck-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/14/remove-mill-glaze-from-new-deck-boards-by-sanding-deck-sanding/cards/pinterest/remove-mill-glaze-from-new-deck-boards-by-sanding-deck-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/14/remove-mill-glaze-from-new-deck-boards-by-sanding-deck-sanding/cards/pinterest/remove-mill-glaze-from-new-deck-boards-by-sanding-deck-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/14/remove-mill-glaze-from-new-deck-boards-by-sanding-deck-sanding/cards/facebook/remove-mill-glaze-from-new-deck-boards-by-sanding-deck-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/14/remove-mill-glaze-from-new-deck-boards-by-sanding-deck-sanding/cards/facebook/remove-mill-glaze-from-new-deck-boards-by-sanding-deck-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/14/remove-mill-glaze-from-new-deck-boards-by-sanding-deck-sanding/cards/facebook/remove-mill-glaze-from-new-deck-boards-by-sanding-deck-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>9</readingTime></item><item><title>Best Grit For Sanding Joint Compound Seams</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/13/best-grit-for-sanding-joint-compound-seams-joint-compound-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/13/best-grit-for-sanding-joint-compound-seams-joint-compound-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 13:47:06 +0000</pubDate><category>Drywall Sanding</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>joint compound</category><category>dust control</category><category>sanding block</category><description>Pro guidance on grits, abrasives, and workflows for joint compound sanding so your drywall seams finish flat, fast, and paint-ready.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="best-grits-for-joint-compound-sanding-seams"&gt;Best Grits for Joint Compound Sanding Seams&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A winter morning, blinds cracked just enough to send a blade of light raking across a newly painted wall. You step closer. What looked perfect last night is now a relief map—slight ridges at the seams, a faint swirl near an inside corner, a shallow shadow where a butt joint telegraphs through. Every drywall finisher knows this moment. Light exposes the reality of surface prep. The good news: this is controllable. With the right abrasive progression and an efficient joint compound sanding workflow, you can make that same morning light your best QC tool, not your enemy.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/15.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/13/best-grit-for-sanding-joint-compound-seams-joint-compound-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-for-sanding-joint-compound-seams-joint-compound-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/13/best-grit-for-sanding-joint-compound-seams-joint-compound-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-for-sanding-joint-compound-seams-joint-compound-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/13/best-grit-for-sanding-joint-compound-seams-joint-compound-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-for-sanding-joint-compound-seams-joint-compound-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/13/best-grit-for-sanding-joint-compound-seams-joint-compound-sanding/cards/instagram/best-grit-for-sanding-joint-compound-seams-joint-compound-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/13/best-grit-for-sanding-joint-compound-seams-joint-compound-sanding/cards/instagram/best-grit-for-sanding-joint-compound-seams-joint-compound-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/13/best-grit-for-sanding-joint-compound-seams-joint-compound-sanding/cards/instagram/best-grit-for-sanding-joint-compound-seams-joint-compound-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/13/best-grit-for-sanding-joint-compound-seams-joint-compound-sanding/cards/pinterest/best-grit-for-sanding-joint-compound-seams-joint-compound-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/13/best-grit-for-sanding-joint-compound-seams-joint-compound-sanding/cards/pinterest/best-grit-for-sanding-joint-compound-seams-joint-compound-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/13/best-grit-for-sanding-joint-compound-seams-joint-compound-sanding/cards/pinterest/best-grit-for-sanding-joint-compound-seams-joint-compound-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/13/best-grit-for-sanding-joint-compound-seams-joint-compound-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-for-sanding-joint-compound-seams-joint-compound-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/13/best-grit-for-sanding-joint-compound-seams-joint-compound-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-for-sanding-joint-compound-seams-joint-compound-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/13/best-grit-for-sanding-joint-compound-seams-joint-compound-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-for-sanding-joint-compound-seams-joint-compound-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Sanding Techniques For Curved And Detailed Molding</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/12/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/12/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 13:48:46 +0000</pubDate><category>Trim &amp; Molding Sanding</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>clear coat</category><category>orbital sander</category><category>sanding block</category><description>Learn expert molding sanding techniques for curved and detailed trim.

&lt;p&gt;The afternoon light hit the hallway just right—the kind of slant that makes crisp edges glow and tiny flaws stand out like little shadows. The old crown molding you’d decided to keep (and just refresh) looked less romantic up close: nicks where movers grazed it, soft ridges from past paint jobs, and a few dips where a power sander had been a touch too enthusiastic. You ran a fingertip along the ogee, felt a wave where a clean curve should be, and realized this was not a job for brute force. It was a job for patience and precision. If you’ve tried molding sanding before, you know the paradox: the more you try to fix a profile, the easier it is to flatten it.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/13.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/12/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding/cards/facebook/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/12/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding/cards/facebook/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/12/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding/cards/facebook/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/12/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding/cards/instagram/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/12/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding/cards/instagram/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/12/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding/cards/instagram/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/12/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding/cards/pinterest/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/12/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding/cards/pinterest/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/12/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding/cards/pinterest/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/12/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding/cards/facebook/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/12/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding/cards/facebook/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/12/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding/cards/facebook/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Fix Dents And White Rings Before Applying New Finish</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 15:12:04 +0000</pubDate><category>Furniture Refinishing</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>sanding block</category><category>clear coat</category><category>dust control</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Learn how to fix dents and white rings before applying a new finish.

&lt;p&gt;Saturday light hits the dining table just right, and that’s both a blessing and a curse. You can see everything: the tiny crater where a laptop corner sank into soft oak during a late-night email sprint, the ghostly white ring from a forgotten coffee mug, the faint scratch where a science project met an impatient sponge. These are the little scars of a life well-lived—until you decide it’s time to refinish. As a workshop guy who lives for clean joins, crisp edges, and silky finishes, I’ve learned that great furniture restoration lives or dies before you ever open a finish can. If you don’t fix dents and lift white rings properly, your “new finish” just spotlights old mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/11.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration/cards/facebook/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration/cards/facebook/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration/cards/facebook/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration/cards/instagram/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration/cards/instagram/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration/cards/instagram/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration/cards/pinterest/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration/cards/pinterest/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration/cards/pinterest/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration/cards/facebook/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration/cards/facebook/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration/cards/facebook/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Identify Grain Direction Before Sanding Surfaces</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/identify-grain-direction-before-sanding-surfaces-grain-preparation/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/identify-grain-direction-before-sanding-surfaces-grain-preparation/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 13:36:01 +0000</pubDate><category>Wood sanding</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>sanding block</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Learn grain preparation: practical tests to read grain direction before sanding, abrasive science that prevents scratches, and steps for flawless finishes.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="grain-preparation-how-to-read-wood-before-sanding"&gt;Grain Preparation: How to Read Wood Before Sanding&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few Saturdays ago, I stood in the morning light with a walnut tabletop that had the right dimensions and the wrong look. Sun traced across the surface at a shallow angle, revealing every swirl left by a rushed sanding job the night before. I’d worked through my grits, vacuumed diligently, and still the surface read like a topographical map of mistakes. What changed the next pass wasn’t a fancier sander or a new finish—it was slowing down to read the wood first. Grain preparation sounds mundane, but it’s the difference between fighting a board and letting it finish itself. When you know which way the fibers lie, where they reverse, and how earlywood and latewood will respond, you save hours and achieve a surface that looks polished even before the first coat.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/09.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/identify-grain-direction-before-sanding-surfaces-grain-preparation/cards/facebook/identify-grain-direction-before-sanding-surfaces-grain-preparation.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/identify-grain-direction-before-sanding-surfaces-grain-preparation/cards/facebook/identify-grain-direction-before-sanding-surfaces-grain-preparation.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/identify-grain-direction-before-sanding-surfaces-grain-preparation/cards/facebook/identify-grain-direction-before-sanding-surfaces-grain-preparation.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/identify-grain-direction-before-sanding-surfaces-grain-preparation/cards/instagram/identify-grain-direction-before-sanding-surfaces-grain-preparation.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/identify-grain-direction-before-sanding-surfaces-grain-preparation/cards/instagram/identify-grain-direction-before-sanding-surfaces-grain-preparation.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/identify-grain-direction-before-sanding-surfaces-grain-preparation/cards/instagram/identify-grain-direction-before-sanding-surfaces-grain-preparation.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/identify-grain-direction-before-sanding-surfaces-grain-preparation/cards/pinterest/identify-grain-direction-before-sanding-surfaces-grain-preparation.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/identify-grain-direction-before-sanding-surfaces-grain-preparation/cards/pinterest/identify-grain-direction-before-sanding-surfaces-grain-preparation.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/identify-grain-direction-before-sanding-surfaces-grain-preparation/cards/pinterest/identify-grain-direction-before-sanding-surfaces-grain-preparation.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/identify-grain-direction-before-sanding-surfaces-grain-preparation/cards/facebook/identify-grain-direction-before-sanding-surfaces-grain-preparation.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/identify-grain-direction-before-sanding-surfaces-grain-preparation/cards/facebook/identify-grain-direction-before-sanding-surfaces-grain-preparation.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/identify-grain-direction-before-sanding-surfaces-grain-preparation/cards/facebook/identify-grain-direction-before-sanding-surfaces-grain-preparation.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Coating Tech To Reduce Heat And Clogging</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/10/coating-tech-to-reduce-heat-and-clogging-abrasive-testing/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/10/coating-tech-to-reduce-heat-and-clogging-abrasive-testing/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 15:28:04 +0000</pubDate><category>Abrasive Innovation &amp; Testing</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>paint prep</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Learn how coating technologies and abrasive testing reduce heat, prevent loading, and optimize sanding workflows for cleaner, faster surface prep.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="abrasive-testing-coatings-to-cut-heat-and-clogging"&gt;Abrasive Testing: Coatings to Cut Heat and Clogging&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The day starts cool, but the shop heats fast. You tape off a panel and power up the 5&amp;quot; random orbital. Within minutes, the disc is skating, resin smears streak the surface, and the pad feels hot enough to warp a finger pad. The clock is merciless. This is the moment where small choices—grain chemistry, topcoat, vacuum pattern—decide whether you flow into primer by lunch or spend the afternoon digging spent discs out of a bin. Heat and loading aren’t just nuisances; they are the leading indicators that your abrasives and process aren’t matched to the substrate, the geometry, or the dust load. That’s exactly where disciplined abrasive testing earns its keep: quantifying cut rates, temperature, and load-up so you can select coatings that stay cool and resist clogging right up to the finishing pass.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/07.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/10/coating-tech-to-reduce-heat-and-clogging-abrasive-testing/cards/facebook/coating-tech-to-reduce-heat-and-clogging-abrasive-testing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/10/coating-tech-to-reduce-heat-and-clogging-abrasive-testing/cards/facebook/coating-tech-to-reduce-heat-and-clogging-abrasive-testing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/10/coating-tech-to-reduce-heat-and-clogging-abrasive-testing/cards/facebook/coating-tech-to-reduce-heat-and-clogging-abrasive-testing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/10/coating-tech-to-reduce-heat-and-clogging-abrasive-testing/cards/instagram/coating-tech-to-reduce-heat-and-clogging-abrasive-testing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/10/coating-tech-to-reduce-heat-and-clogging-abrasive-testing/cards/instagram/coating-tech-to-reduce-heat-and-clogging-abrasive-testing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/10/coating-tech-to-reduce-heat-and-clogging-abrasive-testing/cards/instagram/coating-tech-to-reduce-heat-and-clogging-abrasive-testing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/10/coating-tech-to-reduce-heat-and-clogging-abrasive-testing/cards/pinterest/coating-tech-to-reduce-heat-and-clogging-abrasive-testing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/10/coating-tech-to-reduce-heat-and-clogging-abrasive-testing/cards/pinterest/coating-tech-to-reduce-heat-and-clogging-abrasive-testing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/10/coating-tech-to-reduce-heat-and-clogging-abrasive-testing/cards/pinterest/coating-tech-to-reduce-heat-and-clogging-abrasive-testing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/10/coating-tech-to-reduce-heat-and-clogging-abrasive-testing/cards/facebook/coating-tech-to-reduce-heat-and-clogging-abrasive-testing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/10/coating-tech-to-reduce-heat-and-clogging-abrasive-testing/cards/facebook/coating-tech-to-reduce-heat-and-clogging-abrasive-testing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/10/coating-tech-to-reduce-heat-and-clogging-abrasive-testing/cards/facebook/coating-tech-to-reduce-heat-and-clogging-abrasive-testing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Block Or Bare Hand — When To Use Each Method</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/10/block-or-bare-hand-when-to-use-each-method-hand-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/10/block-or-bare-hand-when-to-use-each-method-hand-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 13:34:24 +0000</pubDate><category>Hand Sanding Techniques</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>sanding block</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>Learn when to choose hand sanding or a sanding block for flat, curved, and detailed surfaces—plus techniques, grits, and tips for flawless results.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="hand-sanding-vs-block-when-each-method-wins"&gt;Hand sanding vs block: when each method wins&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quiet rhythm of sanding is one of the most honest sounds in making. Picture a Saturday afternoon: sunlight across the bench, a project that matters—maybe the oak table your family eats at, a guitar body you’ve been shaping for months, or a door panel you’re finally prepping for paint. You feel the surface more than you see it. The paper whispers over high spots, snags a little on a nick you missed. Instinct nudges the next move—do you keep the tactile connection of hand sanding, or pick up the block to force the surface true?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/05.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/10/block-or-bare-hand-when-to-use-each-method-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/block-or-bare-hand-when-to-use-each-method-hand-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/10/block-or-bare-hand-when-to-use-each-method-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/block-or-bare-hand-when-to-use-each-method-hand-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/10/block-or-bare-hand-when-to-use-each-method-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/block-or-bare-hand-when-to-use-each-method-hand-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/10/block-or-bare-hand-when-to-use-each-method-hand-sanding/cards/instagram/block-or-bare-hand-when-to-use-each-method-hand-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/10/block-or-bare-hand-when-to-use-each-method-hand-sanding/cards/instagram/block-or-bare-hand-when-to-use-each-method-hand-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/10/block-or-bare-hand-when-to-use-each-method-hand-sanding/cards/instagram/block-or-bare-hand-when-to-use-each-method-hand-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/10/block-or-bare-hand-when-to-use-each-method-hand-sanding/cards/pinterest/block-or-bare-hand-when-to-use-each-method-hand-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/10/block-or-bare-hand-when-to-use-each-method-hand-sanding/cards/pinterest/block-or-bare-hand-when-to-use-each-method-hand-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/10/block-or-bare-hand-when-to-use-each-method-hand-sanding/cards/pinterest/block-or-bare-hand-when-to-use-each-method-hand-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/10/block-or-bare-hand-when-to-use-each-method-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/block-or-bare-hand-when-to-use-each-method-hand-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/10/block-or-bare-hand-when-to-use-each-method-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/block-or-bare-hand-when-to-use-each-method-hand-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/10/block-or-bare-hand-when-to-use-each-method-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/block-or-bare-hand-when-to-use-each-method-hand-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Safer Solvent Choices For Wipe Downs</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/09/safer-solvent-choices-for-wipe-downs-eco-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/09/safer-solvent-choices-for-wipe-downs-eco-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 13:43:45 +0000</pubDate><category>Eco &amp; Non-Toxic Abrasives</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-320</category><description>Workshop-safe wipe-down solvents, eco sandpaper prep, and pro protocols for flawless finishes—without harsh fumes or messy residues.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="safer-wipe-down-solvents-and-eco-sandpaper-guide"&gt;Safer Wipe-Down Solvents and Eco Sandpaper Guide&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still remember the first evening I promised myself I’d stop ending shop days with a solvent headache. The project was a walnut credenza destined for our living room, and I wanted it to glow—clean pores, a silky hand, and a finish that would hold up to stray toy cars and weekend dust-offs. I reached for eco sandpaper, the vac humming softly, the pad skating from 150 to 180 grit like I’d planned. Then came the wipe-down, the moment everything either goes beautifully right or annoyingly wrong. I used to grab whatever was closest—mineral spirits, naphtha, alcohol—without a second thought. That’s when the trouble starts: reactivated dyes, smeared filler, hazing that didn’t show up until the first coat.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/03.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/09/safer-solvent-choices-for-wipe-downs-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/safer-solvent-choices-for-wipe-downs-eco-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/09/safer-solvent-choices-for-wipe-downs-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/safer-solvent-choices-for-wipe-downs-eco-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/09/safer-solvent-choices-for-wipe-downs-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/safer-solvent-choices-for-wipe-downs-eco-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/09/safer-solvent-choices-for-wipe-downs-eco-sandpaper/cards/instagram/safer-solvent-choices-for-wipe-downs-eco-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/09/safer-solvent-choices-for-wipe-downs-eco-sandpaper/cards/instagram/safer-solvent-choices-for-wipe-downs-eco-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/09/safer-solvent-choices-for-wipe-downs-eco-sandpaper/cards/instagram/safer-solvent-choices-for-wipe-downs-eco-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/09/safer-solvent-choices-for-wipe-downs-eco-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/safer-solvent-choices-for-wipe-downs-eco-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/09/safer-solvent-choices-for-wipe-downs-eco-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/safer-solvent-choices-for-wipe-downs-eco-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/09/safer-solvent-choices-for-wipe-downs-eco-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/safer-solvent-choices-for-wipe-downs-eco-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/09/safer-solvent-choices-for-wipe-downs-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/safer-solvent-choices-for-wipe-downs-eco-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/09/safer-solvent-choices-for-wipe-downs-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/safer-solvent-choices-for-wipe-downs-eco-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/09/safer-solvent-choices-for-wipe-downs-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/safer-solvent-choices-for-wipe-downs-eco-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>13</readingTime></item><item><title>User Tests For Swirl Mark Reduction</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/08/user-tests-for-swirl-mark-reduction-best-sandpaper-brand/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/08/user-tests-for-swirl-mark-reduction-best-sandpaper-brand/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 13:46:39 +0000</pubDate><category>Brand &amp; Quality Comparison</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-1200</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>clear coat</category><category>mirror finish</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Engineer-tested guide to swirl mark reduction.

&lt;p&gt;The first time I noticed swirl marks, I wasn’t looking for them. A Saturday sunbreak hit my hood just right, and the paint—washed, waxed, and baby’d—looked like a galaxy of faint holograms. If you’ve had the same moment, you know how stubborn those arcs can be. As a product engineer who tests abrasives for a living, I’ve learned swirls aren’t just cosmetic annoyances; they’re microscopic signatures of process, pressure, and particle geometry. And when you’re chasing a mirror finish—whether on automotive clear coat, a guitar body, or a lacquered tabletop—the choice of abrasive is not an afterthought. Selecting the best sandpaper brand for your workflow often determines whether you finish the job in one polishing cycle or chase haze all afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/01.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/08/user-tests-for-swirl-mark-reduction-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/facebook/user-tests-for-swirl-mark-reduction-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/08/user-tests-for-swirl-mark-reduction-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/facebook/user-tests-for-swirl-mark-reduction-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/08/user-tests-for-swirl-mark-reduction-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/facebook/user-tests-for-swirl-mark-reduction-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/08/user-tests-for-swirl-mark-reduction-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/instagram/user-tests-for-swirl-mark-reduction-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/08/user-tests-for-swirl-mark-reduction-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/instagram/user-tests-for-swirl-mark-reduction-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/08/user-tests-for-swirl-mark-reduction-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/instagram/user-tests-for-swirl-mark-reduction-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/08/user-tests-for-swirl-mark-reduction-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/pinterest/user-tests-for-swirl-mark-reduction-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/08/user-tests-for-swirl-mark-reduction-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/pinterest/user-tests-for-swirl-mark-reduction-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/08/user-tests-for-swirl-mark-reduction-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/pinterest/user-tests-for-swirl-mark-reduction-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/08/user-tests-for-swirl-mark-reduction-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/facebook/user-tests-for-swirl-mark-reduction-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/08/user-tests-for-swirl-mark-reduction-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/facebook/user-tests-for-swirl-mark-reduction-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/08/user-tests-for-swirl-mark-reduction-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/facebook/user-tests-for-swirl-mark-reduction-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>When To Choose Cloth Or Fiber Backings</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/07/when-to-choose-cloth-or-fiber-backings-open-coat-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/07/when-to-choose-cloth-or-fiber-backings-open-coat-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 15:23:39 +0000</pubDate><category>Backing Types &amp; Coatings</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><description>Learn when to choose cloth or fiber abrasive backings and how open coat sandpaper improves cut, reduces loading, and optimizes sanding workflows.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="cloth-vs-fiber-backings-with-open-coat-sandpaper"&gt;Cloth vs Fiber Backings with Open Coat Sandpaper&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It starts on a Saturday morning with a surface that matters. Maybe it’s a maple tabletop you milled last fall, or a set of welded brackets you promised to deliver before lunch. You switch on the dust extractor, index a fresh disc, and take the first pass. Within seconds, you know if the setup is right: the abrasive either cuts cleanly or smears; it either stays cool and sheds swarf or loads, glazing the face and burning the work. This isn’t luck. It’s backing selection, grain geometry, and coating density working together. For a lot of workflows—especially on resinous woods, body filler, aluminum, and painted surfaces—open coat sandpaper keeps the cut alive by leaving voids between abrasive grains that evacuate debris instead of embedding it. But even the right coat pattern underperforms if the backing can’t transmit force, resist heat, or conform to the surface you’re shaping.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/28.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/07/when-to-choose-cloth-or-fiber-backings-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-cloth-or-fiber-backings-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/07/when-to-choose-cloth-or-fiber-backings-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-cloth-or-fiber-backings-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/07/when-to-choose-cloth-or-fiber-backings-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-cloth-or-fiber-backings-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/07/when-to-choose-cloth-or-fiber-backings-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/instagram/when-to-choose-cloth-or-fiber-backings-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/07/when-to-choose-cloth-or-fiber-backings-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/instagram/when-to-choose-cloth-or-fiber-backings-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/07/when-to-choose-cloth-or-fiber-backings-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/instagram/when-to-choose-cloth-or-fiber-backings-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/07/when-to-choose-cloth-or-fiber-backings-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/when-to-choose-cloth-or-fiber-backings-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/07/when-to-choose-cloth-or-fiber-backings-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/when-to-choose-cloth-or-fiber-backings-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/07/when-to-choose-cloth-or-fiber-backings-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/when-to-choose-cloth-or-fiber-backings-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/07/when-to-choose-cloth-or-fiber-backings-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-cloth-or-fiber-backings-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/07/when-to-choose-cloth-or-fiber-backings-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-cloth-or-fiber-backings-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/07/when-to-choose-cloth-or-fiber-backings-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-cloth-or-fiber-backings-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Waterproof Binders For Wet Sanding</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/07/waterproof-binders-for-wet-sanding-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/07/waterproof-binders-for-wet-sanding-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 14:17:23 +0000</pubDate><category>Abrasive Materials &amp; Compounds</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>dry sanding</category><category>clear coat</category><category>resin casting</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Learn how waterproof binders and silicon carbide sandpaper work together for flawless wet sanding, from materials to technique, tips, and troubleshooting.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="silicon-carbide-sandpaper-and-waterproof-binders"&gt;Silicon carbide sandpaper and waterproof binders&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a moment in every finishing project when you catch the light just right and see everything: the soft glow of a guitar body after hours of smoothing, the mirror sheen on a freshly clear-coated fender, or the glassy countertop you’ve sanded patiently between pours. Wet sanding is often the bridge to that moment—quiet, controlled, and surprisingly meditative. But if you’ve ever had a sheet turn mushy halfway through, watched abrasive grains shed from the backing, or dealt with that relentless gummy slurry, you’ve met the hidden variable many overlook: the waterproof binder.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/26.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/07/waterproof-binders-for-wet-sanding-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/waterproof-binders-for-wet-sanding-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/07/waterproof-binders-for-wet-sanding-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/waterproof-binders-for-wet-sanding-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/07/waterproof-binders-for-wet-sanding-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/waterproof-binders-for-wet-sanding-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/07/waterproof-binders-for-wet-sanding-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/instagram/waterproof-binders-for-wet-sanding-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/07/waterproof-binders-for-wet-sanding-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/instagram/waterproof-binders-for-wet-sanding-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/07/waterproof-binders-for-wet-sanding-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/instagram/waterproof-binders-for-wet-sanding-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/07/waterproof-binders-for-wet-sanding-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/waterproof-binders-for-wet-sanding-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/07/waterproof-binders-for-wet-sanding-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/waterproof-binders-for-wet-sanding-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/07/waterproof-binders-for-wet-sanding-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/waterproof-binders-for-wet-sanding-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/07/waterproof-binders-for-wet-sanding-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/waterproof-binders-for-wet-sanding-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/07/waterproof-binders-for-wet-sanding-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/waterproof-binders-for-wet-sanding-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/07/waterproof-binders-for-wet-sanding-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/waterproof-binders-for-wet-sanding-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Check Flatness Before Higher Grits</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/07/check-flatness-before-higher-grits-concrete-polishing/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/07/check-flatness-before-higher-grits-concrete-polishing/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 13:45:51 +0000</pubDate><category>Stone &amp; Concrete Polishing</category><category>grit-200</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit progression</category><category>mirror finish</category><description>Master concrete polishing with pro steps to verify flatness before climbing grits.

&lt;p&gt;The first time I chased a mirror finish on a tired garage slab, I thought more passes and higher grits would solve everything. The grinder hummed, the vacuum roared, and the floor looked decent—until late afternoon sun spilled across it and exposed a field of faint troughs and ghost scratches. You know that sinking feeling: you’ve already climbed to 400 grit and realize the slab isn’t flat enough to carry a true reflection. That’s the money-losing moment in concrete polishing—when you’re forced to drop back down, rework the metal steps, and eat the day.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/24.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/07/check-flatness-before-higher-grits-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/check-flatness-before-higher-grits-concrete-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/07/check-flatness-before-higher-grits-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/check-flatness-before-higher-grits-concrete-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/07/check-flatness-before-higher-grits-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/check-flatness-before-higher-grits-concrete-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/07/check-flatness-before-higher-grits-concrete-polishing/cards/instagram/check-flatness-before-higher-grits-concrete-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/07/check-flatness-before-higher-grits-concrete-polishing/cards/instagram/check-flatness-before-higher-grits-concrete-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/07/check-flatness-before-higher-grits-concrete-polishing/cards/instagram/check-flatness-before-higher-grits-concrete-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/07/check-flatness-before-higher-grits-concrete-polishing/cards/pinterest/check-flatness-before-higher-grits-concrete-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/07/check-flatness-before-higher-grits-concrete-polishing/cards/pinterest/check-flatness-before-higher-grits-concrete-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/07/check-flatness-before-higher-grits-concrete-polishing/cards/pinterest/check-flatness-before-higher-grits-concrete-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/07/check-flatness-before-higher-grits-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/check-flatness-before-higher-grits-concrete-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/07/check-flatness-before-higher-grits-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/check-flatness-before-higher-grits-concrete-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/07/check-flatness-before-higher-grits-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/check-flatness-before-higher-grits-concrete-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Vacuum And Rinse Workflow On Boats</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/06/vacuum-and-rinse-workflow-on-boats-boat-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/06/vacuum-and-rinse-workflow-on-boats-boat-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 14:41:08 +0000</pubDate><category>Marine Sanding</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>Engineer-tested vacuum and rinse workflow for boat sanding—tools, setup, and tips to control dust and slurry, protect gelcoat, and finish faster.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="boat-sanding-vacuum-and-rinse-workflow-that-works"&gt;Boat Sanding: Vacuum and Rinse Workflow That Works&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A still marina at sunrise, dew on the rails, and a hull that shows every hour of sun and salt—this is when the work feels personal. It’s also when mistakes cost the most. I’ve stood under boats where a random-orbit sander turned a calm morning into a chalky blizzard, and I’ve also seen a hull rinsed so haphazardly that the rinse water dragged spent abrasive deep into pores, staining the gelcoat for days. Boat sanding sounds simple—move through the grits, keep it flat, don’t burn the surface—but the truth is that your vacuum and rinse workflow will make or break finish quality, crew health, and yard compliance.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/22.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/06/vacuum-and-rinse-workflow-on-boats-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/vacuum-and-rinse-workflow-on-boats-boat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/06/vacuum-and-rinse-workflow-on-boats-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/vacuum-and-rinse-workflow-on-boats-boat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/06/vacuum-and-rinse-workflow-on-boats-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/vacuum-and-rinse-workflow-on-boats-boat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/06/vacuum-and-rinse-workflow-on-boats-boat-sanding/cards/instagram/vacuum-and-rinse-workflow-on-boats-boat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/06/vacuum-and-rinse-workflow-on-boats-boat-sanding/cards/instagram/vacuum-and-rinse-workflow-on-boats-boat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/06/vacuum-and-rinse-workflow-on-boats-boat-sanding/cards/instagram/vacuum-and-rinse-workflow-on-boats-boat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/06/vacuum-and-rinse-workflow-on-boats-boat-sanding/cards/pinterest/vacuum-and-rinse-workflow-on-boats-boat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/06/vacuum-and-rinse-workflow-on-boats-boat-sanding/cards/pinterest/vacuum-and-rinse-workflow-on-boats-boat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/06/vacuum-and-rinse-workflow-on-boats-boat-sanding/cards/pinterest/vacuum-and-rinse-workflow-on-boats-boat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/06/vacuum-and-rinse-workflow-on-boats-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/vacuum-and-rinse-workflow-on-boats-boat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/06/vacuum-and-rinse-workflow-on-boats-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/vacuum-and-rinse-workflow-on-boats-boat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/06/vacuum-and-rinse-workflow-on-boats-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/vacuum-and-rinse-workflow-on-boats-boat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Avoid Deep Scratches By Skipping Grits</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/06/avoid-deep-scratches-by-skipping-grits-glass-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/06/avoid-deep-scratches-by-skipping-grits-glass-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 13:43:34 +0000</pubDate><category>Glass &amp; Ceramics Sanding</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-1200</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Master glass sanding without deep scratches.

&lt;p&gt;A few hours before guests arrived, I watched a friend trace a fingertip over the chipped rim of a vintage decanter—his grandmother’s. The room was quiet, the kind of quiet that magnifies small flaws into loud ones. The plan was simple: true the rim, restore the clarity, and bring back the smooth hand-feel that says this object is cared for. He had the abrasives, a spray bottle, a soft pad, and the patience to learn. What he didn’t have yet—what most people underestimate—is a deliberate grit progression that avoids planting damage deeper than you can later remove. Glass sanding looks deceptively simple.

&lt;p&gt;The moment you flip on a bright desk lamp is when the truth comes out. A pendant you poured, sanded, and buffed over a quiet weekend looks flawless under normal room light. But under that focused beam, faint fog appears along the edges. Micro-swirls show up in arcs you didn’t notice before. A tiny speck you thought you removed winks back at you. If you’ve tried resin polishing even a few times, you’ve seen this: strong light is uncompromising. It magnifies every scratch, ripple, and residue, turning a “good” finish into one you’re not quite ready to sign your name to.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/18.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/check-clarity-under-strong-lighting-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/check-clarity-under-strong-lighting-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/check-clarity-under-strong-lighting-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/check-clarity-under-strong-lighting-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/check-clarity-under-strong-lighting-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/check-clarity-under-strong-lighting-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/check-clarity-under-strong-lighting-resin-polishing/cards/instagram/check-clarity-under-strong-lighting-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/check-clarity-under-strong-lighting-resin-polishing/cards/instagram/check-clarity-under-strong-lighting-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/check-clarity-under-strong-lighting-resin-polishing/cards/instagram/check-clarity-under-strong-lighting-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/check-clarity-under-strong-lighting-resin-polishing/cards/pinterest/check-clarity-under-strong-lighting-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/check-clarity-under-strong-lighting-resin-polishing/cards/pinterest/check-clarity-under-strong-lighting-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/check-clarity-under-strong-lighting-resin-polishing/cards/pinterest/check-clarity-under-strong-lighting-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/check-clarity-under-strong-lighting-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/check-clarity-under-strong-lighting-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/check-clarity-under-strong-lighting-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/check-clarity-under-strong-lighting-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/check-clarity-under-strong-lighting-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/check-clarity-under-strong-lighting-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Wet Sanding Plastics To Control Dust</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 15:17:50 +0000</pubDate><category>Plastic &amp; Epoxy Sanding</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-280</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>dust control</category><category>dry sanding</category><category>orbital sander</category><category>sanding block</category><description>Wet-sand plastics without the mess.

&lt;p&gt;You know that moment when you pick up a 3D‑printed part or an acrylic panel and see the tiny ridges, support nubs, and swirl marks catching the light? That’s when I head to the sink or a tray and set up for wet sanding. I’ve spent years making surfaces behave—wood, composites, plastics—and here’s the truth: wet sanding plastics is the calm, controlled path to a finish you can sign your name to. And the best tricks I learned polishing resin pours and doing epoxy sanding apply beautifully here—steady pressure, smart grit climbs, and keeping abrasives clean so they cut instead of smear.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/16.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding/cards/instagram/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding/cards/instagram/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding/cards/instagram/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding/cards/pinterest/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding/cards/pinterest/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding/cards/pinterest/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Pad Pairing For Microfinishing Discs</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/pad-pairing-for-microfinishing-discs-microfinishing-film/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/pad-pairing-for-microfinishing-discs-microfinishing-film/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 13:46:57 +0000</pubDate><category>Specialty Abrasives</category><category>grit-800</category><category>mirror finish</category><description>Engineer-tested guide to pairing pads with microfinishing film discs for better flatness, lower heat, and consistent Ra on metals, composites, and optics.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="pad-pairing-for-microfinishing-film-discs"&gt;Pad Pairing for Microfinishing Film Discs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first time I watched a jeweler chase a mirror finish on a platinum ring, it wasn’t the abrasive that caught my attention—it was the pad beneath it. The disc was a microfinishing film, a precise matrix of micron-graded minerals on a stable polyester backing. But the backup pad defined the outcome: too hard and the ring’s curvature developed flat spots; too soft and the surface stayed wavy, with fine orange peel that refused to leave. The abrasive had the grit and the science. The pad governed pressure distribution, heat, and the path to consistency.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/14.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/pad-pairing-for-microfinishing-discs-microfinishing-film/cards/facebook/pad-pairing-for-microfinishing-discs-microfinishing-film.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/pad-pairing-for-microfinishing-discs-microfinishing-film/cards/facebook/pad-pairing-for-microfinishing-discs-microfinishing-film.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/pad-pairing-for-microfinishing-discs-microfinishing-film/cards/facebook/pad-pairing-for-microfinishing-discs-microfinishing-film.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/pad-pairing-for-microfinishing-discs-microfinishing-film/cards/instagram/pad-pairing-for-microfinishing-discs-microfinishing-film.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/pad-pairing-for-microfinishing-discs-microfinishing-film/cards/instagram/pad-pairing-for-microfinishing-discs-microfinishing-film.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/pad-pairing-for-microfinishing-discs-microfinishing-film/cards/instagram/pad-pairing-for-microfinishing-discs-microfinishing-film.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/pad-pairing-for-microfinishing-discs-microfinishing-film/cards/pinterest/pad-pairing-for-microfinishing-discs-microfinishing-film.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/pad-pairing-for-microfinishing-discs-microfinishing-film/cards/pinterest/pad-pairing-for-microfinishing-discs-microfinishing-film.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/pad-pairing-for-microfinishing-discs-microfinishing-film/cards/pinterest/pad-pairing-for-microfinishing-discs-microfinishing-film.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/pad-pairing-for-microfinishing-discs-microfinishing-film/cards/facebook/pad-pairing-for-microfinishing-discs-microfinishing-film.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/pad-pairing-for-microfinishing-discs-microfinishing-film/cards/facebook/pad-pairing-for-microfinishing-discs-microfinishing-film.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/pad-pairing-for-microfinishing-discs-microfinishing-film/cards/facebook/pad-pairing-for-microfinishing-discs-microfinishing-film.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Use Soft Interface Pad For Curved Areas</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/04/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/04/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jan 2026 13:34:57 +0000</pubDate><category>Waterproof &amp; Wet/Dry Paper</category><category>grit-280</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-1200</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>orbital sander</category><description>Master curved-surface sanding with soft interface pads and wet dry sandpaper.

&lt;p&gt;The first time you chase a flawless finish across a curving fender, a hand-turned wooden bowl, or the bell of an aluminum bike frame, you learn quickly that flat-surface habits don’t translate. On a crown or complex radius, the surface fights back—edges burn through, pressure spikes leave troughs, and scratches creep in from directions you didn’t intend. The instinct is to push harder or switch to a coarser abrasive; the better move is to refine the contact mechanics. This is where a soft interface pad and properly chosen wet dry sandpaper change the game. Together, they transform an unpredictable contour into a controllable contact patch, preserving geometry while delivering consistent cut and uniform scratch.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/12.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/04/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/04/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/04/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/04/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/instagram/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/04/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/instagram/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/04/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/instagram/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/04/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/04/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/04/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/04/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/04/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/04/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Film Backed Ceramics For Uniform Scratch</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jan 2026 15:06:46 +0000</pubDate><category>Ceramic &amp; Premium Abrasives</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-280</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>dust control</category><category>clear coat</category><description>Learn how film-backed ceramic sanding discs deliver a uniform scratch pattern with better cut and control.

&lt;p&gt;You notice it first in the light. That telltale halo that appears when you shift the panel under a shop lamp, the swirl that refuses to quit even after another pass with the sander. Maybe it’s a cabinet door you’ve been nursing back to life, a car fender in primer that has to be perfect for color, or a guitar body on its third clear coat. You’re not chasing shine yet—you’re chasing uniformity. A clean, even scratch pattern is the quiet foundation of every flawless finish, and when it isn’t there, everything downstream becomes harder: filler prints through, paint mottles, topcoats telegraph the tiniest inconsistencies. The solution often starts earlier than we think—at the abrasive itself.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/10.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Edge And Profile Grit Selection</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jan 2026 13:34:23 +0000</pubDate><category>Grit Range &amp; Classification</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-101</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-280</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><description>Learn to pick the right sandpaper grit for edges and profiles.

&lt;p&gt;It starts with the first swipe on a sharp, splintery edge—maybe the oak tabletop you rescued, the cabinet door frame you’re painting for a bathroom refresh, or the picture frame for a gift that’s due tonight. In the quiet of the workshop, dust hangs in the light and you feel the edge transform under your fingers. The urge is to “just sand it” and keep going. But edges and profiles aren’t flat panels; they magnify every mistake. Round over too far and the joint line disappears. Skip a grit and scratch ghosts show up in the finish. Choose the wrong sandpaper grit and you’ll waste time or, worse, bruise a delicate profile you spent hours cutting.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/08.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit/cards/instagram/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit/cards/instagram/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit/cards/instagram/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit/cards/pinterest/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit/cards/pinterest/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit/cards/pinterest/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Grit Sequence For Hardwood Versus Softwood</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/02/grit-sequence-for-hardwood-versus-softwood-sandpaper-grit-chart/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/02/grit-sequence-for-hardwood-versus-softwood-sandpaper-grit-chart/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 15:05:34 +0000</pubDate><category>Grit Guide &amp; Education</category><category>grit chart</category><category>abrasive standards</category><category>grit progression</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><description>Engineer-tested grit sequences for hardwood vs softwood, with a clear sandpaper grit chart, material science insights, and pro tips for faster, cleaner</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="sandpaper-grit-chart-hardwood-vs-softwood-guide"&gt;Sandpaper Grit Chart: Hardwood vs Softwood Guide&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a rainy Saturday in my small basement shop, I set a maple board on the bench next to a knotty piece of pine. The goal seemed simple: sand both to a flawless, finish-ready surface without wasting time or rounding edges. But if you’ve ever swapped back and forth between hardwood and softwood, you know the result can be anything but simple—soft pine can gum up a disc in minutes, while dense maple highlights every stray swirl you hoped wouldn’t show through the finish. I pulled out my sanding cart, a set of discs from P80 to P240, and the printed sandpaper grit chart I keep taped to a cabinet door. The right sequence is less about dogma and more about physics: grain hardness, resin content, abrasive mineral, and scratch geometry interacting in real time.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/06.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/02/grit-sequence-for-hardwood-versus-softwood-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/grit-sequence-for-hardwood-versus-softwood-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/02/grit-sequence-for-hardwood-versus-softwood-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/grit-sequence-for-hardwood-versus-softwood-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/02/grit-sequence-for-hardwood-versus-softwood-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/grit-sequence-for-hardwood-versus-softwood-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/02/grit-sequence-for-hardwood-versus-softwood-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/instagram/grit-sequence-for-hardwood-versus-softwood-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/02/grit-sequence-for-hardwood-versus-softwood-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/instagram/grit-sequence-for-hardwood-versus-softwood-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/02/grit-sequence-for-hardwood-versus-softwood-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/instagram/grit-sequence-for-hardwood-versus-softwood-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/02/grit-sequence-for-hardwood-versus-softwood-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/pinterest/grit-sequence-for-hardwood-versus-softwood-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/02/grit-sequence-for-hardwood-versus-softwood-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/pinterest/grit-sequence-for-hardwood-versus-softwood-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/02/grit-sequence-for-hardwood-versus-softwood-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/pinterest/grit-sequence-for-hardwood-versus-softwood-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/02/grit-sequence-for-hardwood-versus-softwood-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/grit-sequence-for-hardwood-versus-softwood-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/02/grit-sequence-for-hardwood-versus-softwood-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/grit-sequence-for-hardwood-versus-softwood-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/02/grit-sequence-for-hardwood-versus-softwood-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/grit-sequence-for-hardwood-versus-softwood-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>13</readingTime></item><item><title>Negative Pressure Setup To Control Dust Spread</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/02/negative-pressure-setup-to-control-dust-spread-dustless-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/02/negative-pressure-setup-to-control-dust-spread-dustless-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 13:38:37 +0000</pubDate><category>Dust Extraction Systems</category><category>grit-180</category><category>dust control</category><description>Design negative-pressure containment and pair it with dustless sanding to stop jobsite dust at the source.

&lt;p&gt;You can almost hear the sigh when the first pass of 120-grit levels a joint, the wall turning from patched to pristine. Then the moment breaks—fine powder blooms into the light, spiraling toward the hallway where a toddler naps and the HVAC returns hum. Anyone who has lived through a remodel knows that dust isn’t just a nuisance; it migrates through door gaps, rides thermal currents, and infiltrates electronics, textiles, and lungs. That’s why modern workflows pair dustless sanding at the tool with a properly engineered negative-pressure setup for the room. One contains the debris at its source; the other controls the air itself, ensuring any fugitive particles move in only one direction—out.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/04.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/02/negative-pressure-setup-to-control-dust-spread-dustless-sanding/cards/facebook/negative-pressure-setup-to-control-dust-spread-dustless-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/02/negative-pressure-setup-to-control-dust-spread-dustless-sanding/cards/facebook/negative-pressure-setup-to-control-dust-spread-dustless-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/02/negative-pressure-setup-to-control-dust-spread-dustless-sanding/cards/facebook/negative-pressure-setup-to-control-dust-spread-dustless-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/02/negative-pressure-setup-to-control-dust-spread-dustless-sanding/cards/instagram/negative-pressure-setup-to-control-dust-spread-dustless-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/02/negative-pressure-setup-to-control-dust-spread-dustless-sanding/cards/instagram/negative-pressure-setup-to-control-dust-spread-dustless-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/02/negative-pressure-setup-to-control-dust-spread-dustless-sanding/cards/instagram/negative-pressure-setup-to-control-dust-spread-dustless-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/02/negative-pressure-setup-to-control-dust-spread-dustless-sanding/cards/pinterest/negative-pressure-setup-to-control-dust-spread-dustless-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/02/negative-pressure-setup-to-control-dust-spread-dustless-sanding/cards/pinterest/negative-pressure-setup-to-control-dust-spread-dustless-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/02/negative-pressure-setup-to-control-dust-spread-dustless-sanding/cards/pinterest/negative-pressure-setup-to-control-dust-spread-dustless-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/02/negative-pressure-setup-to-control-dust-spread-dustless-sanding/cards/facebook/negative-pressure-setup-to-control-dust-spread-dustless-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/02/negative-pressure-setup-to-control-dust-spread-dustless-sanding/cards/facebook/negative-pressure-setup-to-control-dust-spread-dustless-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/02/negative-pressure-setup-to-control-dust-spread-dustless-sanding/cards/facebook/negative-pressure-setup-to-control-dust-spread-dustless-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Prevent Edge Burn Through With Softer Pads</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/prevent-edge-burn-through-with-softer-pads-sander-interface-pad/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/prevent-edge-burn-through-with-softer-pads-sander-interface-pad/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 15:51:09 +0000</pubDate><category>Interface Pads &amp; Backing Pads</category><category>grit-180</category><category>dry sanding</category><category>orbital sander</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Learn how a sander interface pad and softer foams prevent edge burn-through, smooth curves, and reduce swirl for cleaner, faster finishing.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="sander-interface-pad-stop-edge-burn-through"&gt;Sander Interface Pad: Stop Edge Burn-Through&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a moment in every refinishing project when you hold your breath: that last pass along a fragile edge. Maybe it’s the rounded lip of a vintage table, the chamfer on a cabinet door, or the bead detail on a banister. You’re almost done, the dust looks light, and then—too late—you see it. A pale halo where the finish burned through to bare wood. It’s a small mistake with big consequences: extra patching, uneven stain absorption, and the sinking feeling that you’ve traded progress for rework. If you’ve been there, know this: control is possible, and a simple swap in your setup can save those edges. A sander interface pad gives your sander a softer touch, spreading pressure, hugging contours, and keeping your finish intact where it’s most vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/02.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/prevent-edge-burn-through-with-softer-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/prevent-edge-burn-through-with-softer-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/prevent-edge-burn-through-with-softer-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/prevent-edge-burn-through-with-softer-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/prevent-edge-burn-through-with-softer-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/prevent-edge-burn-through-with-softer-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/prevent-edge-burn-through-with-softer-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/instagram/prevent-edge-burn-through-with-softer-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/prevent-edge-burn-through-with-softer-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/instagram/prevent-edge-burn-through-with-softer-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/prevent-edge-burn-through-with-softer-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/instagram/prevent-edge-burn-through-with-softer-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/prevent-edge-burn-through-with-softer-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/pinterest/prevent-edge-burn-through-with-softer-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/prevent-edge-burn-through-with-softer-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/pinterest/prevent-edge-burn-through-with-softer-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/prevent-edge-burn-through-with-softer-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/pinterest/prevent-edge-burn-through-with-softer-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/prevent-edge-burn-through-with-softer-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/prevent-edge-burn-through-with-softer-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/prevent-edge-burn-through-with-softer-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/prevent-edge-burn-through-with-softer-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/prevent-edge-burn-through-with-softer-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/prevent-edge-burn-through-with-softer-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Prep Backing Pad Before Sticking Psa</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/prep-backing-pad-before-sticking-psa-psa-sanding-discs/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/prep-backing-pad-before-sticking-psa-psa-sanding-discs/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 15:10:33 +0000</pubDate><category>PSA Discs</category><category>grit-180</category><description>Get flawless adhesion with PSA sanding discs.

&lt;p&gt;The first time a sanding disc flew off mid-pass, I thought my sander had quit on me. The garage smelled like pine dust and hot rubber, the project was a cherry shelf I’d promised to finish by the weekend, and the clock was not on my side. I’d peeled a fresh disc, stuck it down in a hurry, and got to work. Two minutes in, the edge started to curl. Then the disc launched and the pad skated across the stock, chewing a groove I’d need to fix. I shut everything down, quietly fuming. That night, I learned something most folks don’t know until they’ve lost a disc or a project: you don’t just slap on pressure-sensitive discs and hope for the best. You prep the backing pad like it’s a finish step.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/29.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/prep-backing-pad-before-sticking-psa-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/prep-backing-pad-before-sticking-psa-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/prep-backing-pad-before-sticking-psa-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/prep-backing-pad-before-sticking-psa-psa-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/prep-backing-pad-before-sticking-psa-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/prep-backing-pad-before-sticking-psa-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/prep-backing-pad-before-sticking-psa-psa-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/prep-backing-pad-before-sticking-psa-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/prep-backing-pad-before-sticking-psa-psa-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/prep-backing-pad-before-sticking-psa-psa-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/prep-backing-pad-before-sticking-psa-psa-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/prep-backing-pad-before-sticking-psa-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/prep-backing-pad-before-sticking-psa-psa-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/prep-backing-pad-before-sticking-psa-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/prep-backing-pad-before-sticking-psa-psa-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/prep-backing-pad-before-sticking-psa-psa-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/prep-backing-pad-before-sticking-psa-psa-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/prep-backing-pad-before-sticking-psa-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/prep-backing-pad-before-sticking-psa-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/prep-backing-pad-before-sticking-psa-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/prep-backing-pad-before-sticking-psa-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/prep-backing-pad-before-sticking-psa-psa-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/prep-backing-pad-before-sticking-psa-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/prep-backing-pad-before-sticking-psa-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Soft Interface Pad For Contour Sanding</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 13:38:32 +0000</pubDate><category>Hook-and-Loop Discs</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1200</category><description>Engineer-tested guide to soft interface pads for contour sanding and hook and loop sanding discs—materials, heat control, dust, and real-world results.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="hook-and-loop-sanding-discs-and-soft-interface-pads"&gt;Hook and Loop Sanding Discs and Soft Interface Pads&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early Sunday, the shop is quiet except for the soft thrum of a random-orbit sander. You’re easing into the inside radius of a chair arm, the kind of curve where the wood tells on you: one careless second and you’ve burned through stain on the edge. You swap to a softer setup—an interface pad between the pad and your hook and loop sanding discs—and the whole feel changes. The pad yields just enough to keep the abrasive in full contact along the curve, and the sander stops chattering. Your hands relax. The dust stream settles into the vacuum instead of fogging the bench light. The finish doesn’t scream for attention anymore; it whispers that you got the contour right.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/27.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Dust Extraction Setup For Belt Sanding</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/31/dust-extraction-setup-for-belt-sanding-sanding-belts/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/31/dust-extraction-setup-for-belt-sanding-sanding-belts/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 15:08:04 +0000</pubDate><category>Sanding Belts &amp; Machines</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-240</category><category>dust control</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Engineer a clean, safe, and efficient dust extraction setup for belt sanding with practical airflow targets, filtration choices, and abrasive performance tips.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="dust-extraction-setup-for-sanding-belts"&gt;Dust Extraction Setup for Sanding Belts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first time you switch on a belt sander in a quiet shop, the machine’s hum is almost soothing—until the air turns hazy and you feel grit settling on your forearms, your workbench, and the freshly glued panels waiting for finish. Dust isn’t just a nuisance; it’s process noise that blocks your ability to see scratch patterns, compromises adhesive bonds, and creates finish defects that telegraph through the final sheen. If you rely on sanding belts to prep edges, flatten stock, or break sharp corners, a sloppy extraction setup costs you time and quality. The target is not “less dust.” It’s controlled capture at the source, predictable airflow, and filtration that returns clean air to your breathing zone without starving your sander’s performance.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/25.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/31/dust-extraction-setup-for-belt-sanding-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/dust-extraction-setup-for-belt-sanding-sanding-belts.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/31/dust-extraction-setup-for-belt-sanding-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/dust-extraction-setup-for-belt-sanding-sanding-belts.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/31/dust-extraction-setup-for-belt-sanding-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/dust-extraction-setup-for-belt-sanding-sanding-belts.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/31/dust-extraction-setup-for-belt-sanding-sanding-belts/cards/instagram/dust-extraction-setup-for-belt-sanding-sanding-belts.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/31/dust-extraction-setup-for-belt-sanding-sanding-belts/cards/instagram/dust-extraction-setup-for-belt-sanding-sanding-belts.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/31/dust-extraction-setup-for-belt-sanding-sanding-belts/cards/instagram/dust-extraction-setup-for-belt-sanding-sanding-belts.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/31/dust-extraction-setup-for-belt-sanding-sanding-belts/cards/pinterest/dust-extraction-setup-for-belt-sanding-sanding-belts.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/31/dust-extraction-setup-for-belt-sanding-sanding-belts/cards/pinterest/dust-extraction-setup-for-belt-sanding-sanding-belts.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/31/dust-extraction-setup-for-belt-sanding-sanding-belts/cards/pinterest/dust-extraction-setup-for-belt-sanding-sanding-belts.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/31/dust-extraction-setup-for-belt-sanding-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/dust-extraction-setup-for-belt-sanding-sanding-belts.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/31/dust-extraction-setup-for-belt-sanding-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/dust-extraction-setup-for-belt-sanding-sanding-belts.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/31/dust-extraction-setup-for-belt-sanding-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/dust-extraction-setup-for-belt-sanding-sanding-belts.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Clean A Sanding Sponge To Restore Cut</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/31/clean-a-sanding-sponge-to-restore-cut-sanding-sponge/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/31/clean-a-sanding-sponge-to-restore-cut-sanding-sponge/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 13:37:47 +0000</pubDate><category>Sanding Sponges</category><category>grit-240</category><description>Revive clogged sanding sponges fast.

&lt;p&gt;You notice it mid-stroke: the surface stops changing, and the sound of sanding turns from a crisp hiss to a dull whisper. Your palm is steady, the motion is right—yet the finish barely budges. It’s not your technique. It’s the tool. The sanding sponge that felt sharp yesterday is now glazed with fine dust, paint nibs, and resin. You could toss it, but there’s a better, thriftier, and more sustainable option: clean it to restore the cut.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/23.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/31/clean-a-sanding-sponge-to-restore-cut-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/clean-a-sanding-sponge-to-restore-cut-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/31/clean-a-sanding-sponge-to-restore-cut-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/clean-a-sanding-sponge-to-restore-cut-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/31/clean-a-sanding-sponge-to-restore-cut-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/clean-a-sanding-sponge-to-restore-cut-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/31/clean-a-sanding-sponge-to-restore-cut-sanding-sponge/cards/instagram/clean-a-sanding-sponge-to-restore-cut-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/31/clean-a-sanding-sponge-to-restore-cut-sanding-sponge/cards/instagram/clean-a-sanding-sponge-to-restore-cut-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/31/clean-a-sanding-sponge-to-restore-cut-sanding-sponge/cards/instagram/clean-a-sanding-sponge-to-restore-cut-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/31/clean-a-sanding-sponge-to-restore-cut-sanding-sponge/cards/pinterest/clean-a-sanding-sponge-to-restore-cut-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/31/clean-a-sanding-sponge-to-restore-cut-sanding-sponge/cards/pinterest/clean-a-sanding-sponge-to-restore-cut-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/31/clean-a-sanding-sponge-to-restore-cut-sanding-sponge/cards/pinterest/clean-a-sanding-sponge-to-restore-cut-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/31/clean-a-sanding-sponge-to-restore-cut-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/clean-a-sanding-sponge-to-restore-cut-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/31/clean-a-sanding-sponge-to-restore-cut-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/clean-a-sanding-sponge-to-restore-cut-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/31/clean-a-sanding-sponge-to-restore-cut-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/clean-a-sanding-sponge-to-restore-cut-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Cross Sanding Method For Leveling Panels</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 15:55:05 +0000</pubDate><category>Sanding Blocks</category><category>grit-240</category><category>sanding block</category><category>clear coat</category><category>orbital sander</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Learn the cross sanding method for leveling panels.

&lt;p&gt;The first time you chase “flat” across a panel, it sneaks up on you. Early morning, bench light low and raking, coffee cooling by the vise. You sight across a tabletop you’ve glued up—a handsome mix of maple and walnut—certain you nailed the clamps this time. But you feel it before you see it: the slightest rise where two boards meet, a shallow dish near one corner that catches the light like a ripple on a still pond. It’s not bad, but it’s enough to make a finish telegraph every imperfection. You could reach for a random orbital and it would eventually get you there, but it’s like mowing a lawn in circles. There’s a faster, more controlled way to true a surface: cross sanding with a sanding block.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/21.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block/cards/facebook/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block/cards/facebook/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block/cards/facebook/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block/cards/instagram/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block/cards/instagram/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block/cards/instagram/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block/cards/facebook/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block/cards/facebook/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block/cards/facebook/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Sequence Grits For Profiles And Corners</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 14:25:34 +0000</pubDate><category>Detail Sander Sheets</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><description>Engineer’s guide to sequencing grits for profiles and corners with detail sander sheets, including test-backed grit orders and pro tips for crisp edges</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="detail-sander-sheets-sequencing-grits-for-profiles"&gt;Detail sander sheets: sequencing grits for profiles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a Saturday morning in the shop, you pull the tape off a freshly routed maple picture frame and hit it with raking light. The ogee looks clean at first glance—but your fingertips catch tiny ridges where the cutter eased in and out, and the inside corners still show faint milling lines. You grab a delta sander, slide on a fresh pack of detail sander sheets, and take a breath. This is the moment that separates a merely “good enough” piece from one that reads crisp at arm’s length and holds up under a client’s inspection light.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/19.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets/cards/instagram/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets/cards/instagram/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets/cards/instagram/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets/cards/pinterest/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets/cards/pinterest/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets/cards/pinterest/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>13</readingTime></item><item><title>Proper Hand Pressure And Speed Control</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/proper-hand-pressure-and-speed-control-random-orbital-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/proper-hand-pressure-and-speed-control-random-orbital-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 13:42:18 +0000</pubDate><category>Random Orbital Sanding</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-2100</category><category>orbital sander</category><description>Master hand pressure and speed control for random orbital sanding to boost surface prep quality, abrasive life, and finish consistency.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="random-orbital-sanding-pressure-and-speed-mastery"&gt;Random Orbital Sanding: Pressure and Speed Mastery&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning, shop lights humming, a fresh cup of coffee cooling beside a maple tabletop you’ve been saving for months. You click on the extractor, roll the hose into your elbow, and set the 5&amp;quot; sander on the surface. The pad spins up with that familiar soft whir. You start at the far corner, let the tool’s own weight settle, and begin to track across the grain. Two passes in, you see it: faint pigtails reflecting in the raking light. You aren’t new to sanding; you’re careful with grits, dust removal, and vacuum airflow. But random orbital sanding still has a way of punishing rushed technique. You realize your grip has tightened and your forearm is leaning into the head—too much pressure. The speed dial is still at max from the last adhesive removal task. Heat builds, the abrasive dulls, and the swirl gremlins come to life.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/17.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/proper-hand-pressure-and-speed-control-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/proper-hand-pressure-and-speed-control-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/proper-hand-pressure-and-speed-control-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/proper-hand-pressure-and-speed-control-random-orbital-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/proper-hand-pressure-and-speed-control-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/proper-hand-pressure-and-speed-control-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/proper-hand-pressure-and-speed-control-random-orbital-sanding/cards/instagram/proper-hand-pressure-and-speed-control-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/proper-hand-pressure-and-speed-control-random-orbital-sanding/cards/instagram/proper-hand-pressure-and-speed-control-random-orbital-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/proper-hand-pressure-and-speed-control-random-orbital-sanding/cards/instagram/proper-hand-pressure-and-speed-control-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/proper-hand-pressure-and-speed-control-random-orbital-sanding/cards/pinterest/proper-hand-pressure-and-speed-control-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/proper-hand-pressure-and-speed-control-random-orbital-sanding/cards/pinterest/proper-hand-pressure-and-speed-control-random-orbital-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/proper-hand-pressure-and-speed-control-random-orbital-sanding/cards/pinterest/proper-hand-pressure-and-speed-control-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/proper-hand-pressure-and-speed-control-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/proper-hand-pressure-and-speed-control-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/proper-hand-pressure-and-speed-control-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/proper-hand-pressure-and-speed-control-random-orbital-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/proper-hand-pressure-and-speed-control-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/proper-hand-pressure-and-speed-control-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Panel Wipe To Verify True Finish Clarity</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/29/panel-wipe-to-verify-true-finish-clarity-polishing-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/29/panel-wipe-to-verify-true-finish-clarity-polishing-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 14:42:54 +0000</pubDate><category>Polishing &amp; Finishing</category><category>mirror finish</category><category>polishing pads</category><category>grit progression</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>clear coat</category><description>Learn how to use panel wipe to verify true finish clarity, plus smart grit choices and polishing sandpaper tips for a mirror-like result.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="panel-wipe-and-polishing-sandpaper-for-true-clarity"&gt;Panel Wipe and Polishing Sandpaper for True Clarity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a quiet thrill in the moment you pull a freshly corrected car into the light. You’ve cleared your afternoon, put on a playlist that fades into the background, and laid out your towels like a chef sets knives before service. The paint catches the sun and answers back with depth—sharp reflections, color that seems a shade richer, the kind of shine that makes you stand still and just look. But then the doubts arrive. You switch to a handheld light and tilt your head. Is that a faint arc? A smudge? A ghosted swirl at the edge of a panel? It’s hard to tell whether you’ve achieved true clarity or whether polishing oils are quietly filling and masking your work.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/15.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/29/panel-wipe-to-verify-true-finish-clarity-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/panel-wipe-to-verify-true-finish-clarity-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/29/panel-wipe-to-verify-true-finish-clarity-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/panel-wipe-to-verify-true-finish-clarity-polishing-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/29/panel-wipe-to-verify-true-finish-clarity-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/panel-wipe-to-verify-true-finish-clarity-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/29/panel-wipe-to-verify-true-finish-clarity-polishing-sandpaper/cards/instagram/panel-wipe-to-verify-true-finish-clarity-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/29/panel-wipe-to-verify-true-finish-clarity-polishing-sandpaper/cards/instagram/panel-wipe-to-verify-true-finish-clarity-polishing-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/29/panel-wipe-to-verify-true-finish-clarity-polishing-sandpaper/cards/instagram/panel-wipe-to-verify-true-finish-clarity-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/29/panel-wipe-to-verify-true-finish-clarity-polishing-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/panel-wipe-to-verify-true-finish-clarity-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/29/panel-wipe-to-verify-true-finish-clarity-polishing-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/panel-wipe-to-verify-true-finish-clarity-polishing-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/29/panel-wipe-to-verify-true-finish-clarity-polishing-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/panel-wipe-to-verify-true-finish-clarity-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/29/panel-wipe-to-verify-true-finish-clarity-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/panel-wipe-to-verify-true-finish-clarity-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/29/panel-wipe-to-verify-true-finish-clarity-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/panel-wipe-to-verify-true-finish-clarity-polishing-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/29/panel-wipe-to-verify-true-finish-clarity-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/panel-wipe-to-verify-true-finish-clarity-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Avoid Cutting Through Color Coats When Sanding Between</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/29/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/29/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 13:42:54 +0000</pubDate><category>Between-Coats Sanding</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>clear coat</category><category>grit progression</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>Avoid sand-through on stained or painted projects.

&lt;p&gt;The first time I cut through a beautifully shaded guitar body, it was 11:30 p.m. in a quiet shop. The color was perfect—warm amber base, a gentle burst on the edges, and just enough depth to make the figure dance. I’d laid down two clear coats, feeling confident, and went in for a “quick scuff” before the third. Ten strokes in, the block slipped off a radius and I saw it: a pale witness line peeking through the color, a little halo of heartbreak. If you’ve ever felt that knot in your gut, you know that between coats sanding can make or break a project.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/13.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/29/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/29/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/29/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/29/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding/cards/instagram/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/29/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding/cards/instagram/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/29/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding/cards/instagram/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/29/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding/cards/pinterest/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/29/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding/cards/pinterest/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/29/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding/cards/pinterest/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/29/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/29/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/29/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>How To Sand Old Paint Without Gouging The Substrate</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/28/how-to-sand-old-paint-without-gouging-the-substrate-paint-removal-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/28/how-to-sand-old-paint-without-gouging-the-substrate-paint-removal-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2025 13:35:01 +0000</pubDate><category>Paint Removal &amp; Surface Prep</category><category>paint prep</category><category>rust removal</category><category>primer coat</category><category>sanding block</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>dust control</category><description>Engineer-tested methods for paint removal sanding that strip coatings fast while protecting wood, plaster, fiberglass, and metal from gouges.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="paint-removal-sanding-without-substrate-damage"&gt;Paint Removal Sanding Without Substrate Damage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Saturday light came in low as I rolled the garage door open, coffee steaming on the bench and an old pine door leaning against a pair of horses. I’d painted it twice over the years and regretted both coats: drips along the panels, brush marks telegraphing in every direction, and an all-over chalkiness that made the hardware look fancier than the door deserved. I wanted a clean reset—bare wood, crisp edges, and a surface ready to take finish properly—but without the scars I’ve made in the past. If you’ve ever slipped with a sander and bitten into softwood or plaster, you know the sinking feeling. The goal this time: do the job with the precision of a machinist. For that, paint removal sanding would have to be deliberate, measurable, and controlled.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/11.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/28/how-to-sand-old-paint-without-gouging-the-substrate-paint-removal-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-old-paint-without-gouging-the-substrate-paint-removal-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/28/how-to-sand-old-paint-without-gouging-the-substrate-paint-removal-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-old-paint-without-gouging-the-substrate-paint-removal-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/28/how-to-sand-old-paint-without-gouging-the-substrate-paint-removal-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-old-paint-without-gouging-the-substrate-paint-removal-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/28/how-to-sand-old-paint-without-gouging-the-substrate-paint-removal-sanding/cards/instagram/how-to-sand-old-paint-without-gouging-the-substrate-paint-removal-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/28/how-to-sand-old-paint-without-gouging-the-substrate-paint-removal-sanding/cards/instagram/how-to-sand-old-paint-without-gouging-the-substrate-paint-removal-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/28/how-to-sand-old-paint-without-gouging-the-substrate-paint-removal-sanding/cards/instagram/how-to-sand-old-paint-without-gouging-the-substrate-paint-removal-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/28/how-to-sand-old-paint-without-gouging-the-substrate-paint-removal-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-to-sand-old-paint-without-gouging-the-substrate-paint-removal-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/28/how-to-sand-old-paint-without-gouging-the-substrate-paint-removal-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-to-sand-old-paint-without-gouging-the-substrate-paint-removal-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/28/how-to-sand-old-paint-without-gouging-the-substrate-paint-removal-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-to-sand-old-paint-without-gouging-the-substrate-paint-removal-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/28/how-to-sand-old-paint-without-gouging-the-substrate-paint-removal-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-old-paint-without-gouging-the-substrate-paint-removal-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/28/how-to-sand-old-paint-without-gouging-the-substrate-paint-removal-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-old-paint-without-gouging-the-substrate-paint-removal-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/28/how-to-sand-old-paint-without-gouging-the-substrate-paint-removal-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-old-paint-without-gouging-the-substrate-paint-removal-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Recommended Grit Sequence For Sanding Bare Steel</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/27/recommended-grit-sequence-for-sanding-bare-steel-metal-surface-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/27/recommended-grit-sequence-for-sanding-bare-steel-metal-surface-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 27 Dec 2025 14:21:03 +0000</pubDate><category>Metal Polishing &amp; Rust Repair</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Learn the optimal grit sequence for sanding bare steel, with tooling, abrasives, and workflow guidance to maximize adhesion and finish quality.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="metal-surface-sanding-grit-sequence-for-bare-steel"&gt;Metal surface sanding: grit sequence for bare steel&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You notice it the moment the sander spins down: the hush after the rasp of grit on steel, the faint warmth still in the panel, the tiny constellation of scratch lines all pointing the same way. On Friday night, this fender looked tired—speckled with scale, a wisp of old primer clinging at the edges. Saturday morning it’s a blank canvas in progress, the steel alive again under clean, uniform scratch. Anyone who’s spent a weekend restoring a motorcycle tank or prepping a truck’s rocker knows the difference between “sanded” and “ready.” Metal surface sanding isn’t about making things shiny; it’s about engineering a surface profile that bonds mechanically with the next layer—primer, filler, sealer—without undercutting the geometry or telegraphing flaws. It’s a craft and a sequence, not just a tool choice.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/09.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/27/recommended-grit-sequence-for-sanding-bare-steel-metal-surface-sanding/cards/facebook/recommended-grit-sequence-for-sanding-bare-steel-metal-surface-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/27/recommended-grit-sequence-for-sanding-bare-steel-metal-surface-sanding/cards/facebook/recommended-grit-sequence-for-sanding-bare-steel-metal-surface-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/27/recommended-grit-sequence-for-sanding-bare-steel-metal-surface-sanding/cards/facebook/recommended-grit-sequence-for-sanding-bare-steel-metal-surface-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/27/recommended-grit-sequence-for-sanding-bare-steel-metal-surface-sanding/cards/instagram/recommended-grit-sequence-for-sanding-bare-steel-metal-surface-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/27/recommended-grit-sequence-for-sanding-bare-steel-metal-surface-sanding/cards/instagram/recommended-grit-sequence-for-sanding-bare-steel-metal-surface-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/27/recommended-grit-sequence-for-sanding-bare-steel-metal-surface-sanding/cards/instagram/recommended-grit-sequence-for-sanding-bare-steel-metal-surface-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/27/recommended-grit-sequence-for-sanding-bare-steel-metal-surface-sanding/cards/pinterest/recommended-grit-sequence-for-sanding-bare-steel-metal-surface-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/27/recommended-grit-sequence-for-sanding-bare-steel-metal-surface-sanding/cards/pinterest/recommended-grit-sequence-for-sanding-bare-steel-metal-surface-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/27/recommended-grit-sequence-for-sanding-bare-steel-metal-surface-sanding/cards/pinterest/recommended-grit-sequence-for-sanding-bare-steel-metal-surface-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/27/recommended-grit-sequence-for-sanding-bare-steel-metal-surface-sanding/cards/facebook/recommended-grit-sequence-for-sanding-bare-steel-metal-surface-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/27/recommended-grit-sequence-for-sanding-bare-steel-metal-surface-sanding/cards/facebook/recommended-grit-sequence-for-sanding-bare-steel-metal-surface-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/27/recommended-grit-sequence-for-sanding-bare-steel-metal-surface-sanding/cards/facebook/recommended-grit-sequence-for-sanding-bare-steel-metal-surface-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>How To Tape And Mask Around Headlights Before Restoration</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/27/how-to-tape-and-mask-around-headlights-before-restoration-headlight-restoration/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/27/how-to-tape-and-mask-around-headlights-before-restoration-headlight-restoration/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 27 Dec 2025 13:34:33 +0000</pubDate><category>Headlight Restoration</category><category>grit-800</category><category>wet sanding</category><description>Learn how to tape and mask around headlights before restoration.

&lt;p&gt;You notice it the first time on a late drive home: the road ahead looks strangely dim, and the lane reflectors don’t pop the way they used to. You lean forward, squinting through the windshield as if that will squeeze a little more brightness from your lights. At the next stop, you step out and see it—your once-clear lenses now look cloudy, yellowed at the edges, tired. You search “headlight restoration,” find a few videos, and think: how hard can it be?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/07.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/27/how-to-tape-and-mask-around-headlights-before-restoration-headlight-restoration/cards/facebook/how-to-tape-and-mask-around-headlights-before-restoration-headlight-restoration.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/27/how-to-tape-and-mask-around-headlights-before-restoration-headlight-restoration/cards/facebook/how-to-tape-and-mask-around-headlights-before-restoration-headlight-restoration.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/27/how-to-tape-and-mask-around-headlights-before-restoration-headlight-restoration/cards/facebook/how-to-tape-and-mask-around-headlights-before-restoration-headlight-restoration.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/27/how-to-tape-and-mask-around-headlights-before-restoration-headlight-restoration/cards/instagram/how-to-tape-and-mask-around-headlights-before-restoration-headlight-restoration.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/27/how-to-tape-and-mask-around-headlights-before-restoration-headlight-restoration/cards/instagram/how-to-tape-and-mask-around-headlights-before-restoration-headlight-restoration.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/27/how-to-tape-and-mask-around-headlights-before-restoration-headlight-restoration/cards/instagram/how-to-tape-and-mask-around-headlights-before-restoration-headlight-restoration.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/27/how-to-tape-and-mask-around-headlights-before-restoration-headlight-restoration/cards/pinterest/how-to-tape-and-mask-around-headlights-before-restoration-headlight-restoration.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/27/how-to-tape-and-mask-around-headlights-before-restoration-headlight-restoration/cards/pinterest/how-to-tape-and-mask-around-headlights-before-restoration-headlight-restoration.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/27/how-to-tape-and-mask-around-headlights-before-restoration-headlight-restoration/cards/pinterest/how-to-tape-and-mask-around-headlights-before-restoration-headlight-restoration.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/27/how-to-tape-and-mask-around-headlights-before-restoration-headlight-restoration/cards/facebook/how-to-tape-and-mask-around-headlights-before-restoration-headlight-restoration.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/27/how-to-tape-and-mask-around-headlights-before-restoration-headlight-restoration/cards/facebook/how-to-tape-and-mask-around-headlights-before-restoration-headlight-restoration.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/27/how-to-tape-and-mask-around-headlights-before-restoration-headlight-restoration/cards/facebook/how-to-tape-and-mask-around-headlights-before-restoration-headlight-restoration.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Soak Time For Wet Sanding Paper Or Discs Before Use</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/26/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-paper-or-discs-before-use-wet-sanding-clear-coat/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/26/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-paper-or-discs-before-use-wet-sanding-clear-coat/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 13:38:12 +0000</pubDate><category>Wet Sanding Clear Coat</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>clear coat</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Master soak time for wet sanding paper and discs before use.

&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning in the shop, coffee steaming on the bench, the hood you painted last weekend stares back with a stubborn peel and a couple of dust nibs. There’s a bucket by your boots and a fistful of dark gray sheets curling at the corners. You know the next hour will make or break the finish—this is the moment where patience and process turn wavy reflections into a razor-straight mirror. When you’re wet sanding clear coat, the way you prepare your abrasives—specifically how long you soak them—can be the difference between an easy, controlled cut and a chewed-up mess that forces a respray. I’ve watched pros ruin perfect paint because they rushed the soak. I’ve also seen hobbyists hit glass-smooth results their first time by dialing in this one simple variable.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/05.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/26/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-paper-or-discs-before-use-wet-sanding-clear-coat/cards/facebook/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-paper-or-discs-before-use-wet-sanding-clear-coat.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/26/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-paper-or-discs-before-use-wet-sanding-clear-coat/cards/facebook/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-paper-or-discs-before-use-wet-sanding-clear-coat.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/26/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-paper-or-discs-before-use-wet-sanding-clear-coat/cards/facebook/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-paper-or-discs-before-use-wet-sanding-clear-coat.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/26/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-paper-or-discs-before-use-wet-sanding-clear-coat/cards/instagram/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-paper-or-discs-before-use-wet-sanding-clear-coat.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/26/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-paper-or-discs-before-use-wet-sanding-clear-coat/cards/instagram/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-paper-or-discs-before-use-wet-sanding-clear-coat.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/26/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-paper-or-discs-before-use-wet-sanding-clear-coat/cards/instagram/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-paper-or-discs-before-use-wet-sanding-clear-coat.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/26/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-paper-or-discs-before-use-wet-sanding-clear-coat/cards/pinterest/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-paper-or-discs-before-use-wet-sanding-clear-coat.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/26/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-paper-or-discs-before-use-wet-sanding-clear-coat/cards/pinterest/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-paper-or-discs-before-use-wet-sanding-clear-coat.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/26/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-paper-or-discs-before-use-wet-sanding-clear-coat/cards/pinterest/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-paper-or-discs-before-use-wet-sanding-clear-coat.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/26/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-paper-or-discs-before-use-wet-sanding-clear-coat/cards/facebook/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-paper-or-discs-before-use-wet-sanding-clear-coat.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/26/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-paper-or-discs-before-use-wet-sanding-clear-coat/cards/facebook/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-paper-or-discs-before-use-wet-sanding-clear-coat.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/26/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-paper-or-discs-before-use-wet-sanding-clear-coat/cards/facebook/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-paper-or-discs-before-use-wet-sanding-clear-coat.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Da Sander Versus Random Orbital For Bodywork Preparation</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/25/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/25/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 13:37:54 +0000</pubDate><category>Auto Body Sanding</category><category>grit-40</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>orbital sander</category><description>Engineering review of DA vs RO sanding for car bodywork, with test data on removal rates, finish quality, abrasives, and cost to help you prep panels right.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="da-vs-ro-sanding-for-auto-bodywork-prep"&gt;DA vs RO sanding for Auto Bodywork Prep&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a cool Saturday morning, I wheeled a dented fender onto the stand, grabbed coffee, and stared at two sanders: a pneumatic 6-inch “DA” hanging from the air line, and a compact 5-inch corded random orbital sitting on the bench. The car—an aging hatchback—had a blend of bare metal, polyester filler, and feathered edges where clearcoat met primer. This is the exact moment many DIYers and even pros face: DA vs RO sanding for bodywork prep. You’re not choosing a philosophy; you’re choosing a process that affects dust control, scratch depth, shape fidelity, and the time you’ll spend chasing pigtails or re-spraying primer. I’ve felt the allure of the faster-cutting DA when leveling filler, and I’ve also learned the hard way that an aggressive orbit can tunnel through primer on a convex edge in seconds.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/03.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/25/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding/cards/facebook/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/25/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding/cards/facebook/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/25/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding/cards/facebook/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/25/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding/cards/instagram/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/25/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding/cards/instagram/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/25/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding/cards/instagram/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/25/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding/cards/pinterest/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/25/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding/cards/pinterest/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/25/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding/cards/pinterest/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/25/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding/cards/facebook/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/25/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding/cards/facebook/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/25/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding/cards/facebook/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>How To Sand Floors Without Chatter Marks</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/24/how-to-sand-floors-without-chatter-marks-floor-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/24/how-to-sand-floors-without-chatter-marks-floor-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 14:19:37 +0000</pubDate><category>Floor &amp; Deck Sanding</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-360</category><category>orbital sander</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Eliminate chatter marks with a precise floor sanding workflow—machine setup, abrasive sequencing, and surface prep techniques that produce flat, quiet floors.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="floor-sanding-without-chatter-a-pros-workflow"&gt;Floor Sanding Without Chatter: A Pro’s Workflow&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quiet house at sunrise, the kind of silence that makes you notice details. The boards gleam faintly where a rug used to sit, but everywhere else the finish is tired, dull, and scuffed. You roll the big sander off the truck, shoulders relaxed but eyes scanning for risk. This is where floor sanding gets real: the path between “good enough” and “exceptional” is only a few thousandths of an inch wide. Chatter marks—those rhythmic ripples the light will ruthlessly expose—are the difference. Once you see them, you can’t unsee them. And once they’re sealed under finish, they’ll stare back for years.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/01.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/24/how-to-sand-floors-without-chatter-marks-floor-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-floors-without-chatter-marks-floor-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/24/how-to-sand-floors-without-chatter-marks-floor-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-floors-without-chatter-marks-floor-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/24/how-to-sand-floors-without-chatter-marks-floor-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-floors-without-chatter-marks-floor-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/24/how-to-sand-floors-without-chatter-marks-floor-sanding/cards/instagram/how-to-sand-floors-without-chatter-marks-floor-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/24/how-to-sand-floors-without-chatter-marks-floor-sanding/cards/instagram/how-to-sand-floors-without-chatter-marks-floor-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/24/how-to-sand-floors-without-chatter-marks-floor-sanding/cards/instagram/how-to-sand-floors-without-chatter-marks-floor-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/24/how-to-sand-floors-without-chatter-marks-floor-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-to-sand-floors-without-chatter-marks-floor-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/24/how-to-sand-floors-without-chatter-marks-floor-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-to-sand-floors-without-chatter-marks-floor-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/24/how-to-sand-floors-without-chatter-marks-floor-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-to-sand-floors-without-chatter-marks-floor-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/24/how-to-sand-floors-without-chatter-marks-floor-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-floors-without-chatter-marks-floor-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/24/how-to-sand-floors-without-chatter-marks-floor-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-floors-without-chatter-marks-floor-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/24/how-to-sand-floors-without-chatter-marks-floor-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-floors-without-chatter-marks-floor-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Mesh Versus Paper For Sanding Drywall Joints</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/24/mesh-versus-paper-for-sanding-drywall-joints-drywall-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/24/mesh-versus-paper-for-sanding-drywall-joints-drywall-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 13:37:10 +0000</pubDate><category>Drywall Sanding</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-360</category><category>dust control</category><category>joint compound</category><description>Compare mesh screens vs paper for drywall sanding.

&lt;p&gt;The room looked “almost done” until the afternoon sun told the truth. At the right angle, every joint flashed like a topographical map—hills where the seams had been floated, valleys where a quick pass had cut too deep. You run a palm across the wall and catch a ridge you swear you leveled yesterday. In that everyday moment—standing in a half-finished room with a bucket of joint compound somewhere nearby—you’re bumping into the quiet craft of drywall sanding.

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve ever run your fingers along a glossy window casing and thought, “There’s no way paint will stick to this,” you’re right—at least not for long without the right prep. I’ve walked into plenty of homes where a beautifully painted room is betrayed by peeling, nicked baseboards and door frames. The culprit is almost always the same: slippery, factory-smooth or oil-painted trim with zero mechanical bite. This is where trim sanding earns its keep. Done right, scuff sanding turns that slick plastic-like surface into a paint-friendly foundation that your primer and topcoat can lock onto.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/26.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/23/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/23/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/23/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/23/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding/cards/instagram/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/23/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding/cards/instagram/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/23/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding/cards/instagram/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/23/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/23/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/23/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/23/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/23/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/23/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Strip Or Sand First When Refinishing Furniture Pieces</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/23/strip-or-sand-first-when-refinishing-furniture-pieces-furniture-refinishing/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/23/strip-or-sand-first-when-refinishing-furniture-pieces-furniture-refinishing/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 13:41:01 +0000</pubDate><category>Furniture Refinishing</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Engineer-tested guide on whether to strip or sand first in furniture refinishing, with abrasive science, timing data, and practical workflows.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="strip-or-sand-first-in-furniture-refinishing"&gt;Strip or Sand First in Furniture Refinishing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a cool Saturday morning, I pulled a walnut end table out of an estate-sale pile and set it on sawhorses. Sunlight revealed a familiar crime scene: worn edges, water rings, and a thick amber film that felt rubbery under my fingernail. The decision every restorer faces came next—do I strip the finish chemically or start sanding? In furniture refinishing, that single choice sets the tone for your entire project: speed, mess, surface quality, and even whether you’ll preserve crisp details or blunt them away.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/24.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/23/strip-or-sand-first-when-refinishing-furniture-pieces-furniture-refinishing/cards/facebook/strip-or-sand-first-when-refinishing-furniture-pieces-furniture-refinishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/23/strip-or-sand-first-when-refinishing-furniture-pieces-furniture-refinishing/cards/facebook/strip-or-sand-first-when-refinishing-furniture-pieces-furniture-refinishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/23/strip-or-sand-first-when-refinishing-furniture-pieces-furniture-refinishing/cards/facebook/strip-or-sand-first-when-refinishing-furniture-pieces-furniture-refinishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/23/strip-or-sand-first-when-refinishing-furniture-pieces-furniture-refinishing/cards/instagram/strip-or-sand-first-when-refinishing-furniture-pieces-furniture-refinishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/23/strip-or-sand-first-when-refinishing-furniture-pieces-furniture-refinishing/cards/instagram/strip-or-sand-first-when-refinishing-furniture-pieces-furniture-refinishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/23/strip-or-sand-first-when-refinishing-furniture-pieces-furniture-refinishing/cards/instagram/strip-or-sand-first-when-refinishing-furniture-pieces-furniture-refinishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/23/strip-or-sand-first-when-refinishing-furniture-pieces-furniture-refinishing/cards/pinterest/strip-or-sand-first-when-refinishing-furniture-pieces-furniture-refinishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/23/strip-or-sand-first-when-refinishing-furniture-pieces-furniture-refinishing/cards/pinterest/strip-or-sand-first-when-refinishing-furniture-pieces-furniture-refinishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/23/strip-or-sand-first-when-refinishing-furniture-pieces-furniture-refinishing/cards/pinterest/strip-or-sand-first-when-refinishing-furniture-pieces-furniture-refinishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/23/strip-or-sand-first-when-refinishing-furniture-pieces-furniture-refinishing/cards/facebook/strip-or-sand-first-when-refinishing-furniture-pieces-furniture-refinishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/23/strip-or-sand-first-when-refinishing-furniture-pieces-furniture-refinishing/cards/facebook/strip-or-sand-first-when-refinishing-furniture-pieces-furniture-refinishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/23/strip-or-sand-first-when-refinishing-furniture-pieces-furniture-refinishing/cards/facebook/strip-or-sand-first-when-refinishing-furniture-pieces-furniture-refinishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Best Sandpaper Grits For Sanding Wood</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/22/best-sandpaper-grits-for-sanding-wood-wood-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/22/best-sandpaper-grits-for-sanding-wood-wood-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 13:40:09 +0000</pubDate><category>Wood sanding</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>orbital sander</category><category>dust control</category><description>Choose the best sandpaper grits for wood sanding.

&lt;p&gt;A Saturday morning sunbeam revealed everything—the faint planer tracks on a maple tabletop, a small divot near an edge, and those whisper-thin swirls you only notice after the first coat of finish. A project that looked “almost ready” under overhead light suddenly felt two steps backward under raking light. That moment is where quality begins: in choosing the right starting grit and a disciplined progression that erases, rather than buries, defects. This is the decisive difference between passable and professional surface prep.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/22.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/22/best-sandpaper-grits-for-sanding-wood-wood-sanding/cards/facebook/best-sandpaper-grits-for-sanding-wood-wood-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/22/best-sandpaper-grits-for-sanding-wood-wood-sanding/cards/facebook/best-sandpaper-grits-for-sanding-wood-wood-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/22/best-sandpaper-grits-for-sanding-wood-wood-sanding/cards/facebook/best-sandpaper-grits-for-sanding-wood-wood-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/22/best-sandpaper-grits-for-sanding-wood-wood-sanding/cards/instagram/best-sandpaper-grits-for-sanding-wood-wood-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/22/best-sandpaper-grits-for-sanding-wood-wood-sanding/cards/instagram/best-sandpaper-grits-for-sanding-wood-wood-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/22/best-sandpaper-grits-for-sanding-wood-wood-sanding/cards/instagram/best-sandpaper-grits-for-sanding-wood-wood-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/22/best-sandpaper-grits-for-sanding-wood-wood-sanding/cards/pinterest/best-sandpaper-grits-for-sanding-wood-wood-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/22/best-sandpaper-grits-for-sanding-wood-wood-sanding/cards/pinterest/best-sandpaper-grits-for-sanding-wood-wood-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/22/best-sandpaper-grits-for-sanding-wood-wood-sanding/cards/pinterest/best-sandpaper-grits-for-sanding-wood-wood-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/22/best-sandpaper-grits-for-sanding-wood-wood-sanding/cards/facebook/best-sandpaper-grits-for-sanding-wood-wood-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/22/best-sandpaper-grits-for-sanding-wood-wood-sanding/cards/facebook/best-sandpaper-grits-for-sanding-wood-wood-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/22/best-sandpaper-grits-for-sanding-wood-wood-sanding/cards/facebook/best-sandpaper-grits-for-sanding-wood-wood-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Controlled Swarf Collection For Analysis</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/21/controlled-swarf-collection-for-analysis-abrasive-testing/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/21/controlled-swarf-collection-for-analysis-abrasive-testing/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 21 Dec 2025 14:49:17 +0000</pubDate><category>Abrasive Innovation &amp; Testing</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>Learn controlled swarf collection for analysis—and how abrasive testing connects—to turn machining debris into reliable quality insights and process control.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="abrasive-testing-for-controlled-swarf-collection"&gt;Abrasive testing for controlled swarf collection&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a quiet Monday morning, a machinist starts the first job of the week: a batch of precision shafts destined for a medical device assembly. Surface finish is critical. The machine hums in a familiar rhythm while coolant sweeps away fine metallic specks. By noon, the parts look identical to last week’s, but a go/no-go fixture catches two shafts that slide just a hair too tightly. The QC technician squints under the microscope. Nothing obvious—no gouges, no burrs. Still, something changed. Was it the wheel dressing? A fresh lot of coolant concentrate? Microscopic wheel loading? Or a few degrees difference in coolant temperature? It’s in these moments—when visual checks aren’t enough—that controlled swarf collection for analysis becomes a lifeline.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/20.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/21/controlled-swarf-collection-for-analysis-abrasive-testing/cards/facebook/controlled-swarf-collection-for-analysis-abrasive-testing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/21/controlled-swarf-collection-for-analysis-abrasive-testing/cards/facebook/controlled-swarf-collection-for-analysis-abrasive-testing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/21/controlled-swarf-collection-for-analysis-abrasive-testing/cards/facebook/controlled-swarf-collection-for-analysis-abrasive-testing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/21/controlled-swarf-collection-for-analysis-abrasive-testing/cards/instagram/controlled-swarf-collection-for-analysis-abrasive-testing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/21/controlled-swarf-collection-for-analysis-abrasive-testing/cards/instagram/controlled-swarf-collection-for-analysis-abrasive-testing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/21/controlled-swarf-collection-for-analysis-abrasive-testing/cards/instagram/controlled-swarf-collection-for-analysis-abrasive-testing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/21/controlled-swarf-collection-for-analysis-abrasive-testing/cards/pinterest/controlled-swarf-collection-for-analysis-abrasive-testing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/21/controlled-swarf-collection-for-analysis-abrasive-testing/cards/pinterest/controlled-swarf-collection-for-analysis-abrasive-testing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/21/controlled-swarf-collection-for-analysis-abrasive-testing/cards/pinterest/controlled-swarf-collection-for-analysis-abrasive-testing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/21/controlled-swarf-collection-for-analysis-abrasive-testing/cards/facebook/controlled-swarf-collection-for-analysis-abrasive-testing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/21/controlled-swarf-collection-for-analysis-abrasive-testing/cards/facebook/controlled-swarf-collection-for-analysis-abrasive-testing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/21/controlled-swarf-collection-for-analysis-abrasive-testing/cards/facebook/controlled-swarf-collection-for-analysis-abrasive-testing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>How To Keep Pressure Even During Hand Sanding</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/21/how-to-keep-pressure-even-during-hand-sanding-hand-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/21/how-to-keep-pressure-even-during-hand-sanding-hand-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 21 Dec 2025 13:33:29 +0000</pubDate><category>Hand Sanding Techniques</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-220</category><category>sanding block</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Learn how to keep pressure even during hand sanding with pro body mechanics, blocks, grit strategy, and checks for perfect flats and curves.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="even-pressure-mastery-in-hand-sanding"&gt;Even Pressure Mastery in Hand Sanding&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fresh sheet of paper crackles between your fingers as you kneel beside a project you’ve put your evenings into—a walnut coffee table top you milled by hand, or maybe a maple guitar body you’ve been carving between jobs. You tell yourself it’s “just sanding,” but you know better. One wrong move and a finger groove shows up under the finish. One heavy corner and the veneer starts to whisper thin. The difference between amateur and pro often shows up right here, during hand sanding, in the quiet, repetitive passes that bring wood to life.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/18.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/21/how-to-keep-pressure-even-during-hand-sanding-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-keep-pressure-even-during-hand-sanding-hand-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/21/how-to-keep-pressure-even-during-hand-sanding-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-keep-pressure-even-during-hand-sanding-hand-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/21/how-to-keep-pressure-even-during-hand-sanding-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-keep-pressure-even-during-hand-sanding-hand-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/21/how-to-keep-pressure-even-during-hand-sanding-hand-sanding/cards/instagram/how-to-keep-pressure-even-during-hand-sanding-hand-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/21/how-to-keep-pressure-even-during-hand-sanding-hand-sanding/cards/instagram/how-to-keep-pressure-even-during-hand-sanding-hand-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/21/how-to-keep-pressure-even-during-hand-sanding-hand-sanding/cards/instagram/how-to-keep-pressure-even-during-hand-sanding-hand-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/21/how-to-keep-pressure-even-during-hand-sanding-hand-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-to-keep-pressure-even-during-hand-sanding-hand-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/21/how-to-keep-pressure-even-during-hand-sanding-hand-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-to-keep-pressure-even-during-hand-sanding-hand-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/21/how-to-keep-pressure-even-during-hand-sanding-hand-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-to-keep-pressure-even-during-hand-sanding-hand-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/21/how-to-keep-pressure-even-during-hand-sanding-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-keep-pressure-even-during-hand-sanding-hand-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/21/how-to-keep-pressure-even-during-hand-sanding-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-keep-pressure-even-during-hand-sanding-hand-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/21/how-to-keep-pressure-even-during-hand-sanding-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-keep-pressure-even-during-hand-sanding-hand-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>13</readingTime></item><item><title>Recycling Options For Used Abrasives</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/recycling-options-for-used-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/recycling-options-for-used-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 20 Dec 2025 15:27:17 +0000</pubDate><category>Eco &amp; Non-Toxic Abrasives</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>dry sanding</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Tested routes to recycle used abrasives—eco sandpaper, belts, discs, and media—with data-driven tips, partner options, and shop-ready sorting methods.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="eco-sandpaper-recycling-practical-paths-that-work"&gt;Eco Sandpaper Recycling: Practical Paths That Work&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning, the garage smells like cedar and coffee. My benchtop sander hums a steady rhythm while early light catches the swirls of dust in the air. I’m finishing a bookshelf for my daughter’s room, working through the grits like a metronome: P80, P120, P180. The stack of spent discs grows, their once-sharp grains dulled to amber haze. I pause—one hand on the vacuum hose, the other hovering over the trash bin—and feel that sting of waste. Ever since I switched to an eco sandpaper lineup for shop trials, I’ve noticed the tension more acutely: I want clean finishes and predictable cut rates, but I also want less landfill, fewer microplastics, and smarter material loops. Those disks, belts, and sheets are composites of minerals, resins, and fiber backings; they don’t slot neatly into a blue bin. Tossing them feels like erasing the upstream energy embedded in alumina and binders—the mining, firing, and curing that gave them bite.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/16.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/recycling-options-for-used-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/recycling-options-for-used-abrasives-eco-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/recycling-options-for-used-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/recycling-options-for-used-abrasives-eco-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/recycling-options-for-used-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/recycling-options-for-used-abrasives-eco-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/recycling-options-for-used-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/cards/instagram/recycling-options-for-used-abrasives-eco-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/recycling-options-for-used-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/cards/instagram/recycling-options-for-used-abrasives-eco-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/recycling-options-for-used-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/cards/instagram/recycling-options-for-used-abrasives-eco-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/recycling-options-for-used-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/recycling-options-for-used-abrasives-eco-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/recycling-options-for-used-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/recycling-options-for-used-abrasives-eco-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/recycling-options-for-used-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/recycling-options-for-used-abrasives-eco-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/recycling-options-for-used-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/recycling-options-for-used-abrasives-eco-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/recycling-options-for-used-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/recycling-options-for-used-abrasives-eco-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/recycling-options-for-used-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/recycling-options-for-used-abrasives-eco-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>13</readingTime></item><item><title>Price Versus Performance Over Time</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 20 Dec 2025 14:25:50 +0000</pubDate><category>Brand &amp; Quality Comparison</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><description>A technical guide to selecting the best sandpaper brand for long-term value—cut rate, lifespan, surface quality, and workflow efficiency.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="choosing-the-best-sandpaper-brand-for-long-term-value"&gt;Choosing the best sandpaper brand for long-term value&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning, the shop is quiet except for the steady whirr of a 5-inch random-orbit sander. You watch the dust plume flatten as the extractor spools up, then feel the pad settle onto a maple panel you’ve jointed and planed true. The first passes feel crisp—rapid cut, clean scratch pattern, no chatter. Then the feedback shifts. Heat creeps in. The pad skates slightly, cutting less and loading more. You flip the disc, glance at the resin smear, and do the quick math we all do when we care about price versus performance over time: how many panels per disc, and what did it actually cost to get this surface ready for finish? This is why the question of the best sandpaper brand is never just about brand—it’s about measurable throughput, surface quality, and the total cost of consistency.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/14.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/facebook/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/facebook/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/facebook/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/instagram/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/instagram/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/instagram/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/pinterest/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/pinterest/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/pinterest/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/facebook/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/facebook/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/facebook/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Anti Clog Design For Painted Surfaces</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/anti-clog-design-for-painted-surfaces-open-coat-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/anti-clog-design-for-painted-surfaces-open-coat-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 20 Dec 2025 13:33:05 +0000</pubDate><category>Backing Types &amp; Coatings</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>dry sanding</category><category>sanding block</category><description>Learn how open coat sandpaper and anti-clog coatings deliver smoother results on painted surfaces, with pro tips, gear choices, and troubleshooting.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="open-coat-sandpaper-for-painted-surfaces"&gt;Open Coat Sandpaper for Painted Surfaces&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The weekend starts with a small promise to yourself: fresh paint, clean lines, a room that feels lighter when you walk in. But before the color goes up, something else has to come down—old paint, a rough patch, a drippy corner where the brush ran heavy last time. You pull out a sheet of sandpaper and, for a few strokes, it feels right. Then the dust rolls into pills, the sheet clogs, the finish scratches, and you’re wondering why this simple prep step feels like a fight. If you’ve ever paused mid-sand to pick off gummy paint from your paper, you’ve already met the enemy. The fix doesn’t start with elbow grease; it starts with choosing the right abrasive. On painted surfaces, open coat sandpaper—often paired with an anti-clog “no-fill” layer—doesn’t just last longer; it changes the way the surface behaves while you work.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/12.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/anti-clog-design-for-painted-surfaces-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/anti-clog-design-for-painted-surfaces-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/anti-clog-design-for-painted-surfaces-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/anti-clog-design-for-painted-surfaces-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/anti-clog-design-for-painted-surfaces-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/anti-clog-design-for-painted-surfaces-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/anti-clog-design-for-painted-surfaces-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/instagram/anti-clog-design-for-painted-surfaces-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/anti-clog-design-for-painted-surfaces-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/instagram/anti-clog-design-for-painted-surfaces-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/anti-clog-design-for-painted-surfaces-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/instagram/anti-clog-design-for-painted-surfaces-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/anti-clog-design-for-painted-surfaces-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/anti-clog-design-for-painted-surfaces-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/anti-clog-design-for-painted-surfaces-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/anti-clog-design-for-painted-surfaces-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/anti-clog-design-for-painted-surfaces-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/anti-clog-design-for-painted-surfaces-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/anti-clog-design-for-painted-surfaces-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/anti-clog-design-for-painted-surfaces-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/anti-clog-design-for-painted-surfaces-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/anti-clog-design-for-painted-surfaces-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/anti-clog-design-for-painted-surfaces-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/anti-clog-design-for-painted-surfaces-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Film Versus Paper Backing With Grains</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 17:25:57 +0000</pubDate><category>Abrasive Materials &amp; Compounds</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><description>Film vs paper sandpaper backings explained with grain choices like silicon carbide, plus pro tips for wet/dry sanding and flawless finishes.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="film-vs-paper-backing-with-silicon-carbide-sandpaper"&gt;Film vs Paper Backing with Silicon Carbide Sandpaper&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday mornings in the shop start the same for me: kettle on, soft sun across the bench, and a project at that satisfying almost-there stage. I’d been chasing a glass-flat finish on a walnut desk with an epoxy river, and the last pass was fighting me—tiny swirls that only showed in raking light. I’d been sanding wet to keep dust down, but the paper kept going mushy at the edges. That’s when I swapped in film-backed silicon carbide sandpaper I’d stashed for auto body work. The difference was immediate: the sheet kept its shape, water beaded and carried the swarf away, and the scratch pattern evened out in a few clean passes. The surface went quiet—no chatter, just controlled cutting.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/10.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/instagram/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/instagram/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/instagram/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Edge Tool Blending With Main Field</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-tool-blending-with-main-field-concrete-polishing/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-tool-blending-with-main-field-concrete-polishing/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 15:29:17 +0000</pubDate><category>Stone &amp; Concrete Polishing</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Engineer-tested methods to blend edges with the main field in concrete polishing.

&lt;p&gt;You notice it first at the baseboards. Morning light lands across a kitchen floor that otherwise looks like poured glass, and the edges flash a dull, scratchy halo. In a boutique retail space, the center field mirrors the fixtures, but at the columns and along the walls, the reflection breaks—hazy, slightly orange-peeled, almost like it came from a different contractor. As a product engineer who reviews abrasives and machines for a living, I see this edge-to-field mismatch often, even on projects that nailed aggregate exposure and gloss in the main run. It’s not because teams don’t care; it’s because edge blending is where real-world constraints collide with the material science of concrete polishing: smaller tools, different pressure and speed, heat, slurry load, and changing paste content near walls.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/08.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-tool-blending-with-main-field-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/edge-tool-blending-with-main-field-concrete-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-tool-blending-with-main-field-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/edge-tool-blending-with-main-field-concrete-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-tool-blending-with-main-field-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/edge-tool-blending-with-main-field-concrete-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-tool-blending-with-main-field-concrete-polishing/cards/instagram/edge-tool-blending-with-main-field-concrete-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-tool-blending-with-main-field-concrete-polishing/cards/instagram/edge-tool-blending-with-main-field-concrete-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-tool-blending-with-main-field-concrete-polishing/cards/instagram/edge-tool-blending-with-main-field-concrete-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-tool-blending-with-main-field-concrete-polishing/cards/pinterest/edge-tool-blending-with-main-field-concrete-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-tool-blending-with-main-field-concrete-polishing/cards/pinterest/edge-tool-blending-with-main-field-concrete-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-tool-blending-with-main-field-concrete-polishing/cards/pinterest/edge-tool-blending-with-main-field-concrete-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-tool-blending-with-main-field-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/edge-tool-blending-with-main-field-concrete-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-tool-blending-with-main-field-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/edge-tool-blending-with-main-field-concrete-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-tool-blending-with-main-field-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/edge-tool-blending-with-main-field-concrete-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Edge Control Around Hardware And Seams</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 13:38:27 +0000</pubDate><category>Marine Sanding</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-280</category><category>grit-320</category><description>Advanced boat sanding techniques for edge control around hardware and seams, from abrasives and pads to workflows that protect profiles and finish quality.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="boat-sanding-mastery-edges-hardware-seams"&gt;Boat sanding mastery: edges, hardware, seams&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dock still smells of salt and diesel when you pull the cover back at first light. The hull prints the sunrise in dull reflections, beautiful from afar but cruel up close—pigtails, flat spots, and a halo of scuffs around the stanchion bases where an impatient hand once grazed the gelcoat. Today is about restraint as much as cutting power. Boat sanding isn’t hard in principle; it’s hard because boats are a collage of edges, radii, seams, and fasteners that punish every lapse in control. A random orbital can fair a panel in minutes, then choke at a cleat, overcut a toe rail, or trench a seam if you don’t recalibrate your technique and consumables for the geometry in front of you.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/06.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding/cards/instagram/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding/cards/instagram/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding/cards/instagram/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding/cards/pinterest/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding/cards/pinterest/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding/cards/pinterest/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Hone Ceramic Tile Edges Uniformly</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/18/hone-ceramic-tile-edges-uniformly-glass-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/18/hone-ceramic-tile-edges-uniformly-glass-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 18 Dec 2025 13:48:40 +0000</pubDate><category>Glass &amp; Ceramics Sanding</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-1500</category><description>with methods inspired by glass sanding.

&lt;p&gt;You notice it first with your fingertips. The bathroom is almost finished—the new vanity, the grout drying to a warm gray, the light bouncing off fresh ceramic. But as you reach to wipe away a stray haze line, a sharp corner catches your skin. It’s tiny, the sort of edge that doesn’t look like much, yet it steals the comfort from the space an inch at a time. Uniformly honed tile edges are what make a shower niche feel intentional, a kitchen backsplash look built-in rather than glued on. The margin between “nice” and “nailed it” often lives right there—at the line where glaze, clay, and air meet.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/04.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/18/hone-ceramic-tile-edges-uniformly-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/hone-ceramic-tile-edges-uniformly-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/18/hone-ceramic-tile-edges-uniformly-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/hone-ceramic-tile-edges-uniformly-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/18/hone-ceramic-tile-edges-uniformly-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/hone-ceramic-tile-edges-uniformly-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/18/hone-ceramic-tile-edges-uniformly-glass-sanding/cards/instagram/hone-ceramic-tile-edges-uniformly-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/18/hone-ceramic-tile-edges-uniformly-glass-sanding/cards/instagram/hone-ceramic-tile-edges-uniformly-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/18/hone-ceramic-tile-edges-uniformly-glass-sanding/cards/instagram/hone-ceramic-tile-edges-uniformly-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/18/hone-ceramic-tile-edges-uniformly-glass-sanding/cards/pinterest/hone-ceramic-tile-edges-uniformly-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/18/hone-ceramic-tile-edges-uniformly-glass-sanding/cards/pinterest/hone-ceramic-tile-edges-uniformly-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/18/hone-ceramic-tile-edges-uniformly-glass-sanding/cards/pinterest/hone-ceramic-tile-edges-uniformly-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/18/hone-ceramic-tile-edges-uniformly-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/hone-ceramic-tile-edges-uniformly-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/18/hone-ceramic-tile-edges-uniformly-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/hone-ceramic-tile-edges-uniformly-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/18/hone-ceramic-tile-edges-uniformly-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/hone-ceramic-tile-edges-uniformly-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Clean Pads To Prevent Micro Marring</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 17 Dec 2025 16:21:55 +0000</pubDate><category>Resin Polishing</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>clear coat</category><category>polishing pads</category><description>Stop swirls and haze.

&lt;p&gt;I’ve watched the same scene a hundred times: you finish a long day of shaping, sanding, and dialing in the gloss. The shop is quiet, the floor swept, your coffee cold. You swing the work light across the panel—maybe it’s a black hood, a river table, or a batch of resin bangles—and your stomach sinks. There it is: a faint gray haze of tiny trails that weren’t visible under the shop lights. That’s micro marring, and nine times out of ten it’s not your machine, polish, or even your technique—it’s what’s happening at the pad face. This is where cleaning while you work becomes the difference between “almost” and “absolutely flawless,” whether you’re finishing paint or doing resin polishing on jewelry and tabletops.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/02.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing/cards/instagram/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing/cards/instagram/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing/cards/instagram/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing/cards/pinterest/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing/cards/pinterest/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing/cards/pinterest/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Keep Heat Low To Prevent Softening</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 17 Dec 2025 14:27:08 +0000</pubDate><category>Plastic &amp; Epoxy Sanding</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>wet sanding</category><description>Engineer-tested guide to epoxy sanding without softening.

&lt;p&gt;The room is quiet except for the soft whirr of a 5-inch random orbital sander. You’ve invested hours pouring a resin river through a slab of maple, watched the swirl of pigment lock under crystal clarity, and now you’re finally leveling the surface for that glass-smooth finish. Then it happens—under the pad, the epoxy feels different. The sander drags, the dust turns to smeary ribbons, and the finish dulls into a gummy haze. If you’ve experienced that sinking feeling, you’ve already met the enemy of precision finishing: heat buildup.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/29.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding/cards/instagram/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding/cards/instagram/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding/cards/instagram/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding/cards/pinterest/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding/cards/pinterest/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding/cards/pinterest/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Reduce Polishing Time With Fine Films</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 17 Dec 2025 13:38:35 +0000</pubDate><category>Specialty Abrasives</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-1200</category><category>grit-2000</category><description>Cut polishing time with microfinishing film.

&lt;p&gt;A Sunday evening shop quiets in that special way it does when the last coat finally flashes off. The blade you’ve ground all afternoon catches a line of light on the bench—almost there, but not quite. The scratch from the coarse stage is still telegraphing through, a shallow arc that you can feel more than see. You have two choices: keep chasing it with the same field-worn abrasive, or change the game. This is where microfinishing film earns its keep. With a stable, flat backing and precisely graded minerals, you can push the finish forward predictably instead of gambling time on inconsistent paper or tired belts.

You’ve gathered your bucket, a soft block, and a stack of wet dry sandpaper sheets, promising yourself you’ll go slow and do it right this time. The first passes are almost meditative: water beads, slurry darkens, and the surface gradually evens out. Then, edging along a fender crease, your heart stutters—you feel it grab. One careless swipe, one ounce too much pressure, and suddenly the gloss gives way to dull haze. You squeegee and look closer. A whisper of primer peeks through at the ridge.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/25.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/16/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/16/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/16/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/16/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/instagram/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/16/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/instagram/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/16/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/instagram/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/16/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/16/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/16/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/16/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/16/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/16/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Pressure And Speed Settings For Ceramics</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/16/pressure-and-speed-settings-for-ceramics-ceramic-sanding-discs/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/16/pressure-and-speed-settings-for-ceramics-ceramic-sanding-discs/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 13:44:59 +0000</pubDate><category>Ceramic &amp; Premium Abrasives</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-320</category><category>dust control</category><category>wet sanding</category><description>Learn pro-level pressure and speed settings for ceramics using ceramic sanding discs, with step-by-step methods, tips, and troubleshooting.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="ceramic-sanding-discs-pressure-and-speed-guide"&gt;Ceramic Sanding Discs: Pressure and Speed Guide&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Late Saturday, the shop was warm and humming when a customer walked in with a chipped porcelain threshold. “One wrong pass,” he sighed, pointing at the glossy edge that now had a small bite missing. I recognized it immediately: too much speed, too much pressure, and a disc that glazed over before it could cut clean. I’ve been there—on driftwood, on aluminum, and yes, on ceramic tile where heat and hard grains make every mistake loud and permanent. That’s why pressure and speed matter more with ceramics than almost any other material. Ceramic is unforgiving. The wrong setting with ceramic sanding discs can burnish instead of cut, spike temperatures, and cause micro-cracking or edge blowouts you won’t see until the grout goes in.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/23.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/16/pressure-and-speed-settings-for-ceramics-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/pressure-and-speed-settings-for-ceramics-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/16/pressure-and-speed-settings-for-ceramics-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/pressure-and-speed-settings-for-ceramics-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/16/pressure-and-speed-settings-for-ceramics-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/pressure-and-speed-settings-for-ceramics-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/16/pressure-and-speed-settings-for-ceramics-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/pressure-and-speed-settings-for-ceramics-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/16/pressure-and-speed-settings-for-ceramics-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/pressure-and-speed-settings-for-ceramics-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/16/pressure-and-speed-settings-for-ceramics-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/pressure-and-speed-settings-for-ceramics-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/16/pressure-and-speed-settings-for-ceramics-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/pressure-and-speed-settings-for-ceramics-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/16/pressure-and-speed-settings-for-ceramics-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/pressure-and-speed-settings-for-ceramics-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/16/pressure-and-speed-settings-for-ceramics-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/pressure-and-speed-settings-for-ceramics-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/16/pressure-and-speed-settings-for-ceramics-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/pressure-and-speed-settings-for-ceramics-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/16/pressure-and-speed-settings-for-ceramics-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/pressure-and-speed-settings-for-ceramics-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/16/pressure-and-speed-settings-for-ceramics-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/pressure-and-speed-settings-for-ceramics-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>When To Drop Back A Grit To Fix Defects</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/15/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/15/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 15 Dec 2025 13:46:21 +0000</pubDate><category>Grit Range &amp; Classification</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><description>Practical rules and tests to know when to drop back sandpaper grit to remove defects without over-sanding, from wood and resin to automotive clear coat.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="when-to-drop-back-sandpaper-grit-to-fix-defects"&gt;When to Drop Back Sandpaper Grit to Fix Defects&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning. Coffee cooling on the bench, raking light cutting across your project like a truth serum. You wanted a quick scuff-and-recoat—thirty minutes, tops. Instead, the panel keeps whispering back at you: that line near the edge, the mysterious dull patch that won’t clear, the faint spiral that appears only at a certain angle. You switch sheets, then pressure, then motion, but the micro-scratches stubbornly telegraph through. It’s the universal moment where your patience meets physics: do you keep climbing up the sequence or drop back a sandpaper grit to reset the scratch pattern?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/21.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/15/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/15/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/15/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/15/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit/cards/instagram/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/15/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit/cards/instagram/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/15/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit/cards/instagram/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/15/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit/cards/pinterest/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/15/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit/cards/pinterest/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/15/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit/cards/pinterest/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/15/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/15/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/15/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Final Grit Selection By Finish Type</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/14/final-grit-selection-by-finish-type-sandpaper-grit-chart/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/14/final-grit-selection-by-finish-type-sandpaper-grit-chart/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 14 Dec 2025 13:33:32 +0000</pubDate><category>Grit Guide &amp; Education</category><category>grit chart</category><category>abrasive standards</category><category>grit progression</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-101</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><description>Clear, expert guidance on final grit selection by finish type.

&lt;p&gt;It’s 8:40 p.m. in a quiet shop, and the last pass of the sander will decide everything. The walnut dresser is leveled, drawer faces are flush, and you’ve already tuned the edges by hand. What remains is the final grit choice—the one that determines whether an oil finish glows with depth, a waterborne polyurethane keys properly, or a lacquer topcoat lays down glass-flat. This is where a sandpaper grit chart becomes more than a table of numbers; it’s a translation key between surface profile, abrasive behavior, and finish chemistry. Choose carelessly and you’ll fight adhesion problems, washed-out figure, or telegraphed swirl marks. Choose well and the finish rewards you with clarity, durability, and speed.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/19.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/14/final-grit-selection-by-finish-type-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/final-grit-selection-by-finish-type-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/14/final-grit-selection-by-finish-type-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/final-grit-selection-by-finish-type-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/14/final-grit-selection-by-finish-type-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/final-grit-selection-by-finish-type-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/14/final-grit-selection-by-finish-type-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/instagram/final-grit-selection-by-finish-type-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/14/final-grit-selection-by-finish-type-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/instagram/final-grit-selection-by-finish-type-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/14/final-grit-selection-by-finish-type-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/instagram/final-grit-selection-by-finish-type-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/14/final-grit-selection-by-finish-type-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/pinterest/final-grit-selection-by-finish-type-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/14/final-grit-selection-by-finish-type-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/pinterest/final-grit-selection-by-finish-type-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/14/final-grit-selection-by-finish-type-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/pinterest/final-grit-selection-by-finish-type-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/14/final-grit-selection-by-finish-type-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/final-grit-selection-by-finish-type-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/14/final-grit-selection-by-finish-type-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/final-grit-selection-by-finish-type-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/14/final-grit-selection-by-finish-type-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/final-grit-selection-by-finish-type-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Use Bag Plus Hepa Filter For Drywall Dust</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/13/use-bag-plus-hepa-filter-for-drywall-dust-dustless-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/13/use-bag-plus-hepa-filter-for-drywall-dust-dustless-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 13 Dec 2025 13:32:51 +0000</pubDate><category>Dust Extraction Systems</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-320</category><description>Learn how to pair a HEPA bag and filter for dustless sanding, keeping drywall dust under control with cleaner air, faster cleanup, and pro-grade results.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="dustless-sanding-with-hepa-bags-for-drywall-dust"&gt;Dustless sanding with HEPA bags for drywall dust&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first time you sand fresh drywall, you learn how sneaky the dust can be. It drifts like fog—settling in coffee cups, clinging to jackets by the door, finding its way into rooms you never even entered. A weekend project becomes a week of wiping, vacuuming, and still catching a powdery haze in the afternoon sun. If you’re living in the space you’re renovating, the frustration is double: family life doesn’t pause while you sand. That’s why the right setup—pairing a vacuum bag with a true HEPA filter and a sander built for dustless sanding—changes everything. It’s not just cleaner; it’s calmer. You notice the shift the first time you turn off the sander and the air looks the same as it did before you started.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/17.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/13/use-bag-plus-hepa-filter-for-drywall-dust-dustless-sanding/cards/facebook/use-bag-plus-hepa-filter-for-drywall-dust-dustless-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/13/use-bag-plus-hepa-filter-for-drywall-dust-dustless-sanding/cards/facebook/use-bag-plus-hepa-filter-for-drywall-dust-dustless-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/13/use-bag-plus-hepa-filter-for-drywall-dust-dustless-sanding/cards/facebook/use-bag-plus-hepa-filter-for-drywall-dust-dustless-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/13/use-bag-plus-hepa-filter-for-drywall-dust-dustless-sanding/cards/instagram/use-bag-plus-hepa-filter-for-drywall-dust-dustless-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/13/use-bag-plus-hepa-filter-for-drywall-dust-dustless-sanding/cards/instagram/use-bag-plus-hepa-filter-for-drywall-dust-dustless-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/13/use-bag-plus-hepa-filter-for-drywall-dust-dustless-sanding/cards/instagram/use-bag-plus-hepa-filter-for-drywall-dust-dustless-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/13/use-bag-plus-hepa-filter-for-drywall-dust-dustless-sanding/cards/pinterest/use-bag-plus-hepa-filter-for-drywall-dust-dustless-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/13/use-bag-plus-hepa-filter-for-drywall-dust-dustless-sanding/cards/pinterest/use-bag-plus-hepa-filter-for-drywall-dust-dustless-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/13/use-bag-plus-hepa-filter-for-drywall-dust-dustless-sanding/cards/pinterest/use-bag-plus-hepa-filter-for-drywall-dust-dustless-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/13/use-bag-plus-hepa-filter-for-drywall-dust-dustless-sanding/cards/facebook/use-bag-plus-hepa-filter-for-drywall-dust-dustless-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/13/use-bag-plus-hepa-filter-for-drywall-dust-dustless-sanding/cards/facebook/use-bag-plus-hepa-filter-for-drywall-dust-dustless-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/13/use-bag-plus-hepa-filter-for-drywall-dust-dustless-sanding/cards/facebook/use-bag-plus-hepa-filter-for-drywall-dust-dustless-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Multi Density Pad Stacks For Tricky Shapes</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/multi-density-pad-stacks-for-tricky-shapes-sander-interface-pad/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/multi-density-pad-stacks-for-tricky-shapes-sander-interface-pad/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 12 Dec 2025 16:15:21 +0000</pubDate><category>Interface Pads &amp; Backing Pads</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>orbital sander</category><description>Learn how to build multi-density sander interface pad stacks for tricky shapes, with step-by-step setups, pro tips, and real-world sanding techniques.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="multi-density-sander-interface-pad-stacks-for-curves"&gt;Multi-Density Sander Interface Pad Stacks for Curves&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first time you chase a graceful curve with a flat sanding disc, you feel it: that tiny chatter, the scratch that won’t blend out, the edge that suddenly burns through. It’s a lesson every builder learns, whether you’re shaping a guitar heel, blending autobody filler into a wheel arch, or easing a bullnose on oak treads. In my shop, those moments used to slow projects to a crawl—especially when my random orbital insisted on flattening what I needed to caress. Then I started stacking foam like a chef layers flavors: soft for drape, medium for control, thin for crispness. That stack, centered on a sander interface pad, turned my sander into a shape-following tool instead of a shape-fighting one.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/15.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/multi-density-pad-stacks-for-tricky-shapes-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/multi-density-pad-stacks-for-tricky-shapes-sander-interface-pad.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/multi-density-pad-stacks-for-tricky-shapes-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/multi-density-pad-stacks-for-tricky-shapes-sander-interface-pad.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/multi-density-pad-stacks-for-tricky-shapes-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/multi-density-pad-stacks-for-tricky-shapes-sander-interface-pad.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/multi-density-pad-stacks-for-tricky-shapes-sander-interface-pad/cards/instagram/multi-density-pad-stacks-for-tricky-shapes-sander-interface-pad.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/multi-density-pad-stacks-for-tricky-shapes-sander-interface-pad/cards/instagram/multi-density-pad-stacks-for-tricky-shapes-sander-interface-pad.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/multi-density-pad-stacks-for-tricky-shapes-sander-interface-pad/cards/instagram/multi-density-pad-stacks-for-tricky-shapes-sander-interface-pad.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/multi-density-pad-stacks-for-tricky-shapes-sander-interface-pad/cards/pinterest/multi-density-pad-stacks-for-tricky-shapes-sander-interface-pad.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/multi-density-pad-stacks-for-tricky-shapes-sander-interface-pad/cards/pinterest/multi-density-pad-stacks-for-tricky-shapes-sander-interface-pad.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/multi-density-pad-stacks-for-tricky-shapes-sander-interface-pad/cards/pinterest/multi-density-pad-stacks-for-tricky-shapes-sander-interface-pad.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/multi-density-pad-stacks-for-tricky-shapes-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/multi-density-pad-stacks-for-tricky-shapes-sander-interface-pad.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/multi-density-pad-stacks-for-tricky-shapes-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/multi-density-pad-stacks-for-tricky-shapes-sander-interface-pad.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/multi-density-pad-stacks-for-tricky-shapes-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/multi-density-pad-stacks-for-tricky-shapes-sander-interface-pad.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Best Grits For Leveling Primer</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 12 Dec 2025 14:45:24 +0000</pubDate><category>PSA Discs</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-500</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>clear coat</category><category>wet sanding</category><description>Engineer-tested guide to the best grits for leveling primer.

&lt;p&gt;Saturday mornings in my garage start with coffee, a quiet radio, and a panel that still holds a map of yesterday’s imperfections. The primer is flat gray, but under a raking light you can read it like topography—little ridges around a dent repair, faint peel from a heavy pass, and that one shallow wave you only see when you step back. I’ve learned that this is where the paint job is actually won or lost, not in the clear coat. And the tools matter: the block, the sander orbit, the mineral in the abrasive, even the adhesive that bonds the disc. When I swapped to psa sanding discs on a rigid interface for the first “leveling” cut, I noticed two things right away—straighter panels and fewer surprises after sealer.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/13.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Avoid Edge Lift At High Rpm</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/avoid-edge-lift-at-high-rpm-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/avoid-edge-lift-at-high-rpm-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 12 Dec 2025 13:40:36 +0000</pubDate><category>Hook-and-Loop Discs</category><category>grit-150</category><description>Prevent edge lift at high RPM with hook and loop sanding discs—optimize pads, pressure, heat, and workflow for flawless surface preparation.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="stop-edge-lift-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs-at-rpm"&gt;Stop Edge Lift: Hook and Loop Sanding Discs at RPM&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first time I heard the flit of a disc edge slapping a workpiece at full speed, I knew the surface was lost. The panel had been blocked flat, the vacuum switched on, and the sander wound up to max. Ten seconds later, the perimeter of the abrasive began to chatter. The hook field ran hot, the outer 5 mm lifted, and a spiral scar traced the grain like a tattoo I didn’t order. If you’ve ever watched your finish window close in a heartbeat, you know the feeling—time and material slipping away because the disc couldn’t hold together at speed.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/11.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/avoid-edge-lift-at-high-rpm-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/avoid-edge-lift-at-high-rpm-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/avoid-edge-lift-at-high-rpm-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/avoid-edge-lift-at-high-rpm-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/avoid-edge-lift-at-high-rpm-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/avoid-edge-lift-at-high-rpm-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/avoid-edge-lift-at-high-rpm-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/avoid-edge-lift-at-high-rpm-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/avoid-edge-lift-at-high-rpm-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/avoid-edge-lift-at-high-rpm-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/avoid-edge-lift-at-high-rpm-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/avoid-edge-lift-at-high-rpm-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/avoid-edge-lift-at-high-rpm-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/avoid-edge-lift-at-high-rpm-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/avoid-edge-lift-at-high-rpm-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/avoid-edge-lift-at-high-rpm-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/avoid-edge-lift-at-high-rpm-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/avoid-edge-lift-at-high-rpm-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/avoid-edge-lift-at-high-rpm-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/avoid-edge-lift-at-high-rpm-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/avoid-edge-lift-at-high-rpm-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/avoid-edge-lift-at-high-rpm-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/avoid-edge-lift-at-high-rpm-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/avoid-edge-lift-at-high-rpm-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Select Correct Belt Width For Task</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/select-correct-belt-width-for-task-sanding-belts/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/select-correct-belt-width-for-task-sanding-belts/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 11 Dec 2025 15:16:44 +0000</pubDate><category>Sanding Belts &amp; Machines</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-280</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Learn how to choose the correct sanding belt width for any task, with clear sizing steps, grit pairing advice, setup tips, and safety pointers.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="choosing-the-right-width-for-sanding-belts"&gt;Choosing the Right Width for Sanding Belts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a quiet Saturday morning, you dust off the benchtop sander you’ve had for years. The shop light warms your worktable as you reach for a fresh belt, determined to smooth a wobbly chair you promised to restore. Coffee steams nearby, the radio hums, and for a few minutes it feels like everything slows down. Then, a familiar frustration: chatter marks across the rail. You steady your hands, check alignment, slow your feed—and still the surface doesn’t level cleanly. It’s not your skill. It’s not the grit. It’s the width. This is where many makers and mechanics unknowingly lose time and precision: selecting the wrong width of sanding belts for the job.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/09.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/select-correct-belt-width-for-task-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/select-correct-belt-width-for-task-sanding-belts.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/select-correct-belt-width-for-task-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/select-correct-belt-width-for-task-sanding-belts.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/select-correct-belt-width-for-task-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/select-correct-belt-width-for-task-sanding-belts.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/select-correct-belt-width-for-task-sanding-belts/cards/instagram/select-correct-belt-width-for-task-sanding-belts.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/select-correct-belt-width-for-task-sanding-belts/cards/instagram/select-correct-belt-width-for-task-sanding-belts.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/select-correct-belt-width-for-task-sanding-belts/cards/instagram/select-correct-belt-width-for-task-sanding-belts.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/select-correct-belt-width-for-task-sanding-belts/cards/pinterest/select-correct-belt-width-for-task-sanding-belts.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/select-correct-belt-width-for-task-sanding-belts/cards/pinterest/select-correct-belt-width-for-task-sanding-belts.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/select-correct-belt-width-for-task-sanding-belts/cards/pinterest/select-correct-belt-width-for-task-sanding-belts.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/select-correct-belt-width-for-task-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/select-correct-belt-width-for-task-sanding-belts.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/select-correct-belt-width-for-task-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/select-correct-belt-width-for-task-sanding-belts.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/select-correct-belt-width-for-task-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/select-correct-belt-width-for-task-sanding-belts.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Denibbing With Ultra Fine Sponge Abrasives</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 11 Dec 2025 14:14:40 +0000</pubDate><category>Sanding Sponges</category><category>grit-280</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>mirror finish</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>dry sanding</category><category>clear coat</category><category>dust control</category><description>Learn denibbing with ultra fine sponge abrasives.

&lt;p&gt;The shop was quiet except for the gentle hum of the dust extractor and the tick of cooling lights. I’d just laid the final coat on a black cabinet door—high-gloss lacquer, deep and mirror-like. It looked perfect under the booth lamps… until I rolled it into raking light. There they were: tiny raised specks scattered like stars—dust nibs. No drama, no panic. I’ve been here before. This is where an ultra fine sanding sponge earns its keep. It doesn’t scream for attention like a sander or a buffer; it just quietly, precisely knocks down the dots that ruin a perfect finish.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/07.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge/cards/instagram/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge/cards/instagram/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge/cards/instagram/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge/cards/pinterest/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge/cards/pinterest/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge/cards/pinterest/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Sand Edges Straight With Block Control</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 11 Dec 2025 13:45:02 +0000</pubDate><category>Sanding Blocks</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-280</category><category>sanding block</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Engineer-tested methods to sand edges straight with block control—covering block materials, grits, pressure, and measurement for crisp, furniture-grade results.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="straight-edges-with-a-sanding-block-engineers-guide"&gt;Straight Edges with a Sanding Block: Engineer’s Guide&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a quiet satisfaction when a board’s edge goes from ragged to crisp under your fingertips. You sight down the length, catch a glint of shop light, and see a clean, uninterrupted line—no ripples, no dips, no proud corners snagging a cloth. That straightness is the difference between a door that closes like a whisper and one that bites the jamb. It’s the moment where craft meets physics, and for me—an engineer who lives for process—the right tool is what makes that moment repeatable. For edge work, that tool is a sanding block.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/05.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block/cards/facebook/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block/cards/facebook/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block/cards/facebook/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block/cards/instagram/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block/cards/instagram/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block/cards/instagram/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block/cards/facebook/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block/cards/facebook/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block/cards/facebook/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Use Light Pressure To Prevent Gouging</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/use-light-pressure-to-prevent-gouging-detail-sander-sheets/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/use-light-pressure-to-prevent-gouging-detail-sander-sheets/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 10 Dec 2025 16:10:27 +0000</pubDate><category>Detail Sander Sheets</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-280</category><category>grit progression</category><category>sanding block</category><description>Learn why light pressure prevents gouging and how to choose and use detail sander sheets for cleaner surfaces, longer abrasive life, and consistent finishes.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="why-detail-sander-sheets-require-a-light-touch"&gt;Why Detail Sander Sheets Require a Light Touch&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It starts with a hum—the compact orbit of a delta-pad gliding toward a tight inside corner where a cabinet door stile meets the rail. The walnut is older than your clamps, with grain that doesn’t forgive. You’ve prepped the shop, dialed down the RPM, and set up extraction, but your fingers still tense as you aim the tip into a fillet. Press too hard, and you’ll carve a shallow dish that daylight will announce the moment a finish hits. If you’ve ever found yourself polishing out a crater that appears only under raking light, you know the culprit: load. The solution isn’t exotic; it’s discipline. Use light pressure to prevent gouging—especially when your abrasive is fresh and your tool is nimble. That’s where the right detail sander sheets make or break the outcome.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/03.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/use-light-pressure-to-prevent-gouging-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/use-light-pressure-to-prevent-gouging-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/use-light-pressure-to-prevent-gouging-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/use-light-pressure-to-prevent-gouging-detail-sander-sheets.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/use-light-pressure-to-prevent-gouging-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/use-light-pressure-to-prevent-gouging-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/use-light-pressure-to-prevent-gouging-detail-sander-sheets/cards/instagram/use-light-pressure-to-prevent-gouging-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/use-light-pressure-to-prevent-gouging-detail-sander-sheets/cards/instagram/use-light-pressure-to-prevent-gouging-detail-sander-sheets.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/use-light-pressure-to-prevent-gouging-detail-sander-sheets/cards/instagram/use-light-pressure-to-prevent-gouging-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/use-light-pressure-to-prevent-gouging-detail-sander-sheets/cards/pinterest/use-light-pressure-to-prevent-gouging-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/use-light-pressure-to-prevent-gouging-detail-sander-sheets/cards/pinterest/use-light-pressure-to-prevent-gouging-detail-sander-sheets.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/use-light-pressure-to-prevent-gouging-detail-sander-sheets/cards/pinterest/use-light-pressure-to-prevent-gouging-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/use-light-pressure-to-prevent-gouging-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/use-light-pressure-to-prevent-gouging-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/use-light-pressure-to-prevent-gouging-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/use-light-pressure-to-prevent-gouging-detail-sander-sheets.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/use-light-pressure-to-prevent-gouging-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/use-light-pressure-to-prevent-gouging-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Vacuum Hookup For Dustless Orbital Sanding</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/vacuum-hookup-for-dustless-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/vacuum-hookup-for-dustless-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 10 Dec 2025 15:13:40 +0000</pubDate><category>Random Orbital Sanding</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>dust control</category><category>orbital sander</category><description>Achieve dustless results with smart vacuum hookups for random orbital sanding.

&lt;p&gt;The first time you see true “dustless” sanding, it feels like cheating. The room stays clear, your lungs don’t protest, and the surface looks better with each pass. I remember a Saturday morning in a small basement shop—coffee steaming, maple table top ready, and my playlist queued up—when a familiar dread crept in. I loved building things, but I hated the blizzard of dust that came with it. It wove into sweaters, clung to eyelashes, and added an hour of cleanup to every project. That day, I swapped my old hose for a snug-fitting antistatic one, dialed the vacuum to the sweet spot, and tried random orbital sanding with the vac hooked up. Ten minutes later, I realized I was breathing easier. The snowstorm never came.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/01.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/vacuum-hookup-for-dustless-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/vacuum-hookup-for-dustless-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/vacuum-hookup-for-dustless-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/vacuum-hookup-for-dustless-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/vacuum-hookup-for-dustless-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/vacuum-hookup-for-dustless-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/vacuum-hookup-for-dustless-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/instagram/vacuum-hookup-for-dustless-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/vacuum-hookup-for-dustless-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/instagram/vacuum-hookup-for-dustless-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/vacuum-hookup-for-dustless-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/instagram/vacuum-hookup-for-dustless-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/vacuum-hookup-for-dustless-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/pinterest/vacuum-hookup-for-dustless-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/vacuum-hookup-for-dustless-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/pinterest/vacuum-hookup-for-dustless-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/vacuum-hookup-for-dustless-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/pinterest/vacuum-hookup-for-dustless-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/vacuum-hookup-for-dustless-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/vacuum-hookup-for-dustless-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/vacuum-hookup-for-dustless-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/vacuum-hookup-for-dustless-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/vacuum-hookup-for-dustless-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/vacuum-hookup-for-dustless-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Finish Out Micro Marring And Haze</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 10 Dec 2025 13:42:22 +0000</pubDate><category>Polishing &amp; Finishing</category><category>mirror finish</category><category>polishing pads</category><category>grit progression</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>clear coat</category><description>Learn how to finish out micro marring and haze using polishing sandpaper, pads, and polish.

&lt;p&gt;It’s 9 p.m., the shop lights are humming, and the panel you’ve been nursing all day looks perfect—until you hit it with a tight, cool LED beam. There it is: a faint cloudy halo that follows the light like a shadow. Micro marring. Haze. It doesn’t ruin a job, but it steals the depth that makes a finish sing. I’ve seen it a thousand times—after wet sanding runs, after cutting with a heavy compound, even after a rushed “final” pass. The good news is you can bring the gloss back. You just need the right sequence, the right pressure, and (yes) the right polishing sandpaper so every step sets up the next.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/28.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper/cards/instagram/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper/cards/instagram/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper/cards/instagram/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Tack Cloth And Vacuum Steps After Scuff Sanding</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 17:33:26 +0000</pubDate><category>Between-Coats Sanding</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>dust control</category><category>clear coat</category><description>Engineer-tested steps for between coats sanding: how to vacuum, tack, and scuff for flawless finishes without dust nibs or witness lines.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="between-coats-sanding-with-tack-cloth-and-vacuum"&gt;Between Coats Sanding with Tack Cloth and Vacuum&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first time I cared about finish quality was on a cold Saturday, kneeling on a drop cloth, cradling a cabinet door that looked perfect—until light from the window slid across it. That raking beam turned gentle amber into a topography of dust nibs, witness lines, and a faint, scratchy haze. I’d rushed the cleaning between scuff passes and relied on a single wipe with an old T‑shirt. The result was predictable in hindsight: dust trapped in clear coat, uneven adhesion, and a finish that only looked good under dim light. That afternoon I learned what every disciplined finisher knows: between coats sanding isn’t about aggression—it’s about control.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/26.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding/cards/instagram/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding/cards/instagram/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding/cards/instagram/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding/cards/pinterest/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding/cards/pinterest/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding/cards/pinterest/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Epa Rrp Containment Setup For Lead Paint Sanding</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 15:44:17 +0000</pubDate><category>Paint Removal &amp; Surface Prep</category><category>paint prep</category><category>rust removal</category><category>primer coat</category><category>sanding block</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><description>A technical guide to EPA RRP containment for lead-safe sanding, covering surface prep, abrasive selection, HEPA capture, and low-dust workflows.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="epa-rrp-containment-for-lead-safe-sanding"&gt;EPA RRP Containment for Lead-Safe Sanding&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a moment, right before the sander touches the surface, when a room holds its breath. You’ve taped the vents, rolled up area rugs, shuffled furniture to the hallway. In an older home—maybe one built just after the war, with trim thick enough to show paint strata like tree rings—you feel the weight of history in the baseboards and widow’s walk. You also feel responsibility. Dust is memory made airborne, and when that dust contains lead, it crosses the boundary from nuisance to long-term health hazard in seconds. The job becomes less about “cleaning up later” and more about “controlling everything now.” That’s precisely where epa rrp containment setup lives, and it’s the fulcrum between craftsmanship and care.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/24.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding/cards/facebook/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding/cards/facebook/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding/cards/facebook/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding/cards/instagram/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding/cards/instagram/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding/cards/instagram/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding/cards/pinterest/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding/cards/pinterest/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding/cards/pinterest/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding/cards/facebook/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding/cards/facebook/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding/cards/facebook/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Grind Out Rust And Feather Edges For Patch Repair</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 14:44:40 +0000</pubDate><category>Metal Polishing &amp; Rust Repair</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>rust removal</category><description>Learn rust repair the right way: grind out corrosion, feather paint edges, and patch cleanly for durable, near-invisible automotive fixes.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="rust-repair-101-grind-feather-and-patch-like-pro"&gt;Rust Repair 101: Grind, Feather, and Patch Like Pro&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The moment you notice it is rarely dramatic. Maybe you’re pouring your first cup of coffee, the driveway still cool in the morning shade, when a small bubble on the wheel arch catches your eye. It wasn’t there last summer. You press lightly; the paint flexes and flattens like a blister. It’s a tiny flaw, easy to ignore while the engine warms and the day rushes in. But you know how rust works. It doesn’t wait. It keeps chewing, one quiet day after another, under glossy paint where you can’t see it.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/22.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair/cards/facebook/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair/cards/facebook/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair/cards/facebook/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair/cards/instagram/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair/cards/instagram/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair/cards/instagram/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair/cards/pinterest/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair/cards/pinterest/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair/cards/pinterest/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair/cards/facebook/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair/cards/facebook/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair/cards/facebook/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Identify Hard Factory Coating Versus Simple Surface Oxidation</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 13:41:15 +0000</pubDate><category>Headlight Restoration</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>clear coat</category><description>Learn to spot hard factory coatings vs. simple oxidation on plastics, then restore safely with step-by-step sanding, polishing, and protection.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="plastic-oxidation-removal-coating-vs-surface-oxide"&gt;Plastic Oxidation Removal: Coating vs. Surface Oxide&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning in the shop, coffee ring on the bench, you wipe a thumb across a chalky ATV fender and it ghosts your finger white. Ten feet away, the headlight lens on your daily driver looks foggy and amber; a quick pass with glass cleaner does nothing. On a trailer, the kayak’s once-deep orange now reads as flat and pinkish. If you’ve been hunting for plastic oxidation removal tips, you’re halfway there—but here’s the catch: not all dull plastic is just oxidation. Sometimes you’re seeing degradation of a hard factory coating, and sometimes it’s a thin film of chalk oxidized from the base material itself. Treat them the same and you’ll either stop too early—leaving haze—or go too far—burning through a protective layer you actually needed.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/20.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation/cards/facebook/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation/cards/facebook/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation/cards/facebook/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation/cards/instagram/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation/cards/instagram/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation/cards/instagram/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation/cards/pinterest/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation/cards/pinterest/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation/cards/pinterest/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation/cards/facebook/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation/cards/facebook/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation/cards/facebook/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>When To Choose 2000 Versus 3000 Grit For Clear Refining</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/when-to-choose-2000-versus-3000-grit-for-clear-refining-2000-3000-grit-wet-sandi/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/when-to-choose-2000-versus-3000-grit-for-clear-refining-2000-3000-grit-wet-sandi/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2025 14:35:11 +0000</pubDate><category>Wet Sanding Clear Coat</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>clear coat</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>Engineer’s guide to choosing 2000 vs 3000 grit for wet sanding clear.

&lt;p&gt;On a clear autumn morning I watched a black coupe roll into our test bay, its hood shimmering in early light—beautiful from five meters, troubling at fifty centimeters. The owner had tried to fix a few nibs and orange peel with a single pass of 3000 grit, then compounded. The result was a glossy mirror with a faint gray cast in the sun and a couple of nibs still telegraphing through. I’ve seen the inverse too: a shop tech leveling clear with 2000, only to chase out deep sanding marks all afternoon because the paint had cured hard and the compound wasn’t cutting efficiently. Both scenarios point to the same decision inflection: picking the right end of the 2000–3000 grit wet sanding range for clear refining.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/18.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/when-to-choose-2000-versus-3000-grit-for-clear-refining-2000-3000-grit-wet-sandi/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-2000-versus-3000-grit-for-clear-refining-2000-3000-grit-wet-sandi.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/when-to-choose-2000-versus-3000-grit-for-clear-refining-2000-3000-grit-wet-sandi/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-2000-versus-3000-grit-for-clear-refining-2000-3000-grit-wet-sandi.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/when-to-choose-2000-versus-3000-grit-for-clear-refining-2000-3000-grit-wet-sandi/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-2000-versus-3000-grit-for-clear-refining-2000-3000-grit-wet-sandi.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/when-to-choose-2000-versus-3000-grit-for-clear-refining-2000-3000-grit-wet-sandi/cards/instagram/when-to-choose-2000-versus-3000-grit-for-clear-refining-2000-3000-grit-wet-sandi.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/when-to-choose-2000-versus-3000-grit-for-clear-refining-2000-3000-grit-wet-sandi/cards/instagram/when-to-choose-2000-versus-3000-grit-for-clear-refining-2000-3000-grit-wet-sandi.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/when-to-choose-2000-versus-3000-grit-for-clear-refining-2000-3000-grit-wet-sandi/cards/instagram/when-to-choose-2000-versus-3000-grit-for-clear-refining-2000-3000-grit-wet-sandi.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/when-to-choose-2000-versus-3000-grit-for-clear-refining-2000-3000-grit-wet-sandi/cards/pinterest/when-to-choose-2000-versus-3000-grit-for-clear-refining-2000-3000-grit-wet-sandi.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/when-to-choose-2000-versus-3000-grit-for-clear-refining-2000-3000-grit-wet-sandi/cards/pinterest/when-to-choose-2000-versus-3000-grit-for-clear-refining-2000-3000-grit-wet-sandi.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/when-to-choose-2000-versus-3000-grit-for-clear-refining-2000-3000-grit-wet-sandi/cards/pinterest/when-to-choose-2000-versus-3000-grit-for-clear-refining-2000-3000-grit-wet-sandi.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/when-to-choose-2000-versus-3000-grit-for-clear-refining-2000-3000-grit-wet-sandi/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-2000-versus-3000-grit-for-clear-refining-2000-3000-grit-wet-sandi.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/when-to-choose-2000-versus-3000-grit-for-clear-refining-2000-3000-grit-wet-sandi/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-2000-versus-3000-grit-for-clear-refining-2000-3000-grit-wet-sandi.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/when-to-choose-2000-versus-3000-grit-for-clear-refining-2000-3000-grit-wet-sandi/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-2000-versus-3000-grit-for-clear-refining-2000-3000-grit-wet-sandi.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Apply Dry Guide Coat Evenly Over Primer Before Blocking</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2025 13:40:28 +0000</pubDate><category>Auto Body Sanding</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-500</category><category>grit-600</category><category>dust control</category><description>Learn how to apply a dry guide coat evenly over primer and block panels with precision.

You’ve just laid down a uniform film of high-build primer on a long quarter panel, the kind with a subtle crown that punishes any lapse in technique. Under raking LEDs, the surface looks good—flat at a glance, gray and matte like it should. But you know better. Until you perform disciplined guide coat sanding, there’s no honest way to read the surface. The panel has its history: tap-down marks from the last round of metalwork, a skim of filler you were careful not to overshape, and a featheredge that transitions into OEM finish along the dogleg. If any area is slightly low, the topcoat will amplify it like a megaphone.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/16.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding/cards/facebook/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding/cards/facebook/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding/cards/facebook/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding/cards/instagram/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding/cards/instagram/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding/cards/instagram/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding/cards/pinterest/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding/cards/pinterest/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding/cards/pinterest/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding/cards/facebook/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding/cards/facebook/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding/cards/facebook/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>13</readingTime></item><item><title>Edge Sanding Sequence To Match The Drum Sander Scratch</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/edge-sanding-sequence-to-match-the-drum-sander-scratch-edger-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/edge-sanding-sequence-to-match-the-drum-sander-scratch-edger-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 07 Dec 2025 18:13:47 +0000</pubDate><category>Floor &amp; Deck Sanding</category><category>grit-40</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit progression</category><category>sanding block</category><description>Learn a precise edger sanding sequence to blend edges with drum sander scratches and eliminate halos, swirls, and mismatched textures on hardwood floors.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="edger-sanding-sequence-to-match-drum-scratches"&gt;Edger sanding sequence to match drum scratches&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The afternoon light slid across your living room, catching the raw promise of bare wood. You’d pulled the last nail out, rented the big-machine sander, and felt that satisfying hum as years of finish lifted away in long, clean passes. The field of the floor looked even—linear, disciplined, almost new. Then your eyes drifted to the perimeter, that six to twelve inches along the baseboards where the drum could never reach. There, the grain looked different. A shadowy ring—soft at first—seemed to appear, like a halo you couldn’t unsee.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/14.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/edge-sanding-sequence-to-match-the-drum-sander-scratch-edger-sanding/cards/facebook/edge-sanding-sequence-to-match-the-drum-sander-scratch-edger-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/edge-sanding-sequence-to-match-the-drum-sander-scratch-edger-sanding/cards/facebook/edge-sanding-sequence-to-match-the-drum-sander-scratch-edger-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/edge-sanding-sequence-to-match-the-drum-sander-scratch-edger-sanding/cards/facebook/edge-sanding-sequence-to-match-the-drum-sander-scratch-edger-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/edge-sanding-sequence-to-match-the-drum-sander-scratch-edger-sanding/cards/instagram/edge-sanding-sequence-to-match-the-drum-sander-scratch-edger-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/edge-sanding-sequence-to-match-the-drum-sander-scratch-edger-sanding/cards/instagram/edge-sanding-sequence-to-match-the-drum-sander-scratch-edger-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/edge-sanding-sequence-to-match-the-drum-sander-scratch-edger-sanding/cards/instagram/edge-sanding-sequence-to-match-the-drum-sander-scratch-edger-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/edge-sanding-sequence-to-match-the-drum-sander-scratch-edger-sanding/cards/pinterest/edge-sanding-sequence-to-match-the-drum-sander-scratch-edger-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/edge-sanding-sequence-to-match-the-drum-sander-scratch-edger-sanding/cards/pinterest/edge-sanding-sequence-to-match-the-drum-sander-scratch-edger-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/edge-sanding-sequence-to-match-the-drum-sander-scratch-edger-sanding/cards/pinterest/edge-sanding-sequence-to-match-the-drum-sander-scratch-edger-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/edge-sanding-sequence-to-match-the-drum-sander-scratch-edger-sanding/cards/facebook/edge-sanding-sequence-to-match-the-drum-sander-scratch-edger-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/edge-sanding-sequence-to-match-the-drum-sander-scratch-edger-sanding/cards/facebook/edge-sanding-sequence-to-match-the-drum-sander-scratch-edger-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/edge-sanding-sequence-to-match-the-drum-sander-scratch-edger-sanding/cards/facebook/edge-sanding-sequence-to-match-the-drum-sander-scratch-edger-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Figure Eight Motion For Pole Sander On Walls</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/figure-eight-motion-for-pole-sander-on-walls-pole-sander-drywall/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/figure-eight-motion-for-pole-sander-on-walls-pole-sander-drywall/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 07 Dec 2025 16:34:58 +0000</pubDate><category>Drywall Sanding</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit progression</category><category>orbital sander</category><category>dust control</category><description>Master the figure‑eight motion for pole sanding drywall.

&lt;p&gt;The first time I learned the figure‑eight, it was 6 a.m., coffee in a paint-stained thermos, and a living room taped up like a crime scene. The house belonged to a neighbor who’d done an earnest DIY skim coat. The seams were proud, ridges crisp as a credit card. I’d already spent too many nights fighting walls with the wrong motion: straight up and down, back and forth, carving tracks with a pole head that liked to dig in at the end of each stroke. If you’ve ever wrestled a pole sander drywall on a long seam, you know that end-of-stroke gouge—the one that laughs at you when the primer hits it.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/12.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/figure-eight-motion-for-pole-sander-on-walls-pole-sander-drywall/cards/facebook/figure-eight-motion-for-pole-sander-on-walls-pole-sander-drywall.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/figure-eight-motion-for-pole-sander-on-walls-pole-sander-drywall/cards/facebook/figure-eight-motion-for-pole-sander-on-walls-pole-sander-drywall.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/figure-eight-motion-for-pole-sander-on-walls-pole-sander-drywall/cards/facebook/figure-eight-motion-for-pole-sander-on-walls-pole-sander-drywall.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/figure-eight-motion-for-pole-sander-on-walls-pole-sander-drywall/cards/instagram/figure-eight-motion-for-pole-sander-on-walls-pole-sander-drywall.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/figure-eight-motion-for-pole-sander-on-walls-pole-sander-drywall/cards/instagram/figure-eight-motion-for-pole-sander-on-walls-pole-sander-drywall.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/figure-eight-motion-for-pole-sander-on-walls-pole-sander-drywall/cards/instagram/figure-eight-motion-for-pole-sander-on-walls-pole-sander-drywall.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/figure-eight-motion-for-pole-sander-on-walls-pole-sander-drywall/cards/pinterest/figure-eight-motion-for-pole-sander-on-walls-pole-sander-drywall.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/figure-eight-motion-for-pole-sander-on-walls-pole-sander-drywall/cards/pinterest/figure-eight-motion-for-pole-sander-on-walls-pole-sander-drywall.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/figure-eight-motion-for-pole-sander-on-walls-pole-sander-drywall/cards/pinterest/figure-eight-motion-for-pole-sander-on-walls-pole-sander-drywall.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/figure-eight-motion-for-pole-sander-on-walls-pole-sander-drywall/cards/facebook/figure-eight-motion-for-pole-sander-on-walls-pole-sander-drywall.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/figure-eight-motion-for-pole-sander-on-walls-pole-sander-drywall/cards/facebook/figure-eight-motion-for-pole-sander-on-walls-pole-sander-drywall.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/figure-eight-motion-for-pole-sander-on-walls-pole-sander-drywall/cards/facebook/figure-eight-motion-for-pole-sander-on-walls-pole-sander-drywall.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Best Sanding Sponge Grit For Trim Surface Prep</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 07 Dec 2025 15:12:05 +0000</pubDate><category>Trim &amp; Molding Sanding</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-280</category><category>grit-320</category><category>dry sanding</category><category>sanding block</category><category>dust control</category><description>Engineer-tested guide to pick the best sponge for trim, from grit selection to technique, for flawless adhesion and smooth paint on wood and MDF.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="best-sponge-for-trim-sanding-grits-that-last"&gt;Best sponge for trim: sanding grits that last&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning light spilled across the hallway, revealing every chip and ridge along the baseboards that I’d stopped seeing months ago. The kind of small defects you only notice when you decide to fix them. I laid out the drop cloths and opened the can of trim enamel, mentally penciling in a half-day project. Then I reached for a sponge for trim instead of paper. That choice seems small, but it’s the difference between a paint job that looks good today and one that still looks good next year. As an engineer, I’ve learned that coatings fail at interfaces, not in the middle of the film. And the interface—the mechanical “tooth” you cut into the substrate—comes from your abrasives.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/10.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim/cards/facebook/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim/cards/facebook/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim/cards/facebook/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim/cards/instagram/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim/cards/instagram/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim/cards/instagram/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim/cards/pinterest/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim/cards/pinterest/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim/cards/pinterest/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim/cards/facebook/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim/cards/facebook/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim/cards/facebook/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>What Grit To Sand Furniture Before Applying Stain</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 07 Dec 2025 13:31:13 +0000</pubDate><category>Furniture Refinishing</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-800</category><category>orbital sander</category><category>sanding block</category><category>dust control</category><description>Learn the exact sanding grits, workflows, and checks that drive even stain color and professional results on furniture projects.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="stain-preparation-what-grit-to-sand-furniture"&gt;Stain Preparation: What Grit to Sand Furniture&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a quiet Saturday morning, you clear the dining table and pull the tarp tight. The surface is a patchwork of rings, scratches, and a few mystery stains from a previous life—nothing that an orbital sander and a little patience can’t fix. The smell of sawdust arrives quickly, and with it a deceptively simple choice: what grit to sand furniture before applying stain. There are plenty of opinions, but only one proper sequence for your species, stain type, and condition of the substrate. That decision—more than the brand of stain or even your brushing technique—will decide whether the grain pops evenly or blotches, whether the edges stay crisp or burn through, and whether your topcoat glides over a consistent scratch pattern or amplifies every swirl mark. Done right, stain preparation becomes a repeatable, almost meditative routine that pays off with reliable, beautiful finishes.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/08.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation/cards/facebook/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation/cards/facebook/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation/cards/facebook/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation/cards/instagram/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation/cards/instagram/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation/cards/instagram/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation/cards/pinterest/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation/cards/pinterest/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation/cards/pinterest/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation/cards/facebook/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation/cards/facebook/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation/cards/facebook/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>How To Find Hidden Cross Grain Scratches Before Finishing</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/06/how-to-find-hidden-cross-grain-scratches-before-finishing-cross-grain-scratch-re/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/06/how-to-find-hidden-cross-grain-scratches-before-finishing-cross-grain-scratch-re/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 06 Dec 2025 13:32:43 +0000</pubDate><category>Wood sanding</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit progression</category><category>clear coat</category><description>Learn how to spot hidden cross-grain scratches before finishing, with lighting, guide coats, and sanding strategies for flawless results.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="cross-grain-scratch-removal-find-flaws-before-finish"&gt;Cross-grain scratch removal: find flaws before finish&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s late in the day, and the shop is quiet enough to hear your own breath. You’ve planed, scraped, and sanded a walnut tabletop into a silky plane that reflects light like calm water. The first wipe of finish goes on and your shoulders loosen—until the sheen turns and a faint zebra pattern ghosts across the surface. There they are: those fine cross-grain scratches that seemed invisible a moment ago, now stark under the finish. We talk a lot about sanding sequences, but the real craft is knowing how to find the marks you can’t yet see—and to do it before a finish locks them in forever. That’s the heart of cross-grain scratch removal: finding and fixing the tiny, off-direction lines that explode under dye, oil, or film, and keeping them from stealing focus from the piece you worked so hard to build.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/06.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/06/how-to-find-hidden-cross-grain-scratches-before-finishing-cross-grain-scratch-re/cards/facebook/how-to-find-hidden-cross-grain-scratches-before-finishing-cross-grain-scratch-re.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/06/how-to-find-hidden-cross-grain-scratches-before-finishing-cross-grain-scratch-re/cards/facebook/how-to-find-hidden-cross-grain-scratches-before-finishing-cross-grain-scratch-re.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/06/how-to-find-hidden-cross-grain-scratches-before-finishing-cross-grain-scratch-re/cards/facebook/how-to-find-hidden-cross-grain-scratches-before-finishing-cross-grain-scratch-re.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/06/how-to-find-hidden-cross-grain-scratches-before-finishing-cross-grain-scratch-re/cards/instagram/how-to-find-hidden-cross-grain-scratches-before-finishing-cross-grain-scratch-re.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/06/how-to-find-hidden-cross-grain-scratches-before-finishing-cross-grain-scratch-re/cards/instagram/how-to-find-hidden-cross-grain-scratches-before-finishing-cross-grain-scratch-re.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/06/how-to-find-hidden-cross-grain-scratches-before-finishing-cross-grain-scratch-re/cards/instagram/how-to-find-hidden-cross-grain-scratches-before-finishing-cross-grain-scratch-re.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/06/how-to-find-hidden-cross-grain-scratches-before-finishing-cross-grain-scratch-re/cards/pinterest/how-to-find-hidden-cross-grain-scratches-before-finishing-cross-grain-scratch-re.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/06/how-to-find-hidden-cross-grain-scratches-before-finishing-cross-grain-scratch-re/cards/pinterest/how-to-find-hidden-cross-grain-scratches-before-finishing-cross-grain-scratch-re.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/06/how-to-find-hidden-cross-grain-scratches-before-finishing-cross-grain-scratch-re/cards/pinterest/how-to-find-hidden-cross-grain-scratches-before-finishing-cross-grain-scratch-re.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/06/how-to-find-hidden-cross-grain-scratches-before-finishing-cross-grain-scratch-re/cards/facebook/how-to-find-hidden-cross-grain-scratches-before-finishing-cross-grain-scratch-re.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/06/how-to-find-hidden-cross-grain-scratches-before-finishing-cross-grain-scratch-re/cards/facebook/how-to-find-hidden-cross-grain-scratches-before-finishing-cross-grain-scratch-re.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/06/how-to-find-hidden-cross-grain-scratches-before-finishing-cross-grain-scratch-re/cards/facebook/how-to-find-hidden-cross-grain-scratches-before-finishing-cross-grain-scratch-re.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Microscope Inspection Of Scratch Patterns</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/microscope-inspection-of-scratch-patterns-abrasive-testing/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/microscope-inspection-of-scratch-patterns-abrasive-testing/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 05 Dec 2025 14:26:01 +0000</pubDate><category>Abrasive Innovation &amp; Testing</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Learn how to inspect scratch patterns under a microscope, link them to abrasive testing, and tune your workflow for sharper finishes and reliable results.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="microscope-scratch-inspection-for-abrasive-testing"&gt;Microscope Scratch Inspection for Abrasive Testing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know the feeling: the shop is quiet, the extractor hums, and that last pass felt right. You lift the part—maybe it’s a glass coupon, a knife bevel, a sanded guitar neck, or a brushed aluminum panel—and for a second it looks flawless. Then you slide it under the microscope, roll the focus, and the story changes. The surface that looked satin-smooth at arm’s length shows a lattice of scratches, smeared streaks from a loaded belt, and the ghost of an earlier grit you didn’t fully erase. That’s where abrasive testing and disciplined microscope work pay for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/04.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/microscope-inspection-of-scratch-patterns-abrasive-testing/cards/facebook/microscope-inspection-of-scratch-patterns-abrasive-testing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/microscope-inspection-of-scratch-patterns-abrasive-testing/cards/facebook/microscope-inspection-of-scratch-patterns-abrasive-testing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/microscope-inspection-of-scratch-patterns-abrasive-testing/cards/facebook/microscope-inspection-of-scratch-patterns-abrasive-testing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/microscope-inspection-of-scratch-patterns-abrasive-testing/cards/instagram/microscope-inspection-of-scratch-patterns-abrasive-testing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/microscope-inspection-of-scratch-patterns-abrasive-testing/cards/instagram/microscope-inspection-of-scratch-patterns-abrasive-testing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/microscope-inspection-of-scratch-patterns-abrasive-testing/cards/instagram/microscope-inspection-of-scratch-patterns-abrasive-testing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/microscope-inspection-of-scratch-patterns-abrasive-testing/cards/pinterest/microscope-inspection-of-scratch-patterns-abrasive-testing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/microscope-inspection-of-scratch-patterns-abrasive-testing/cards/pinterest/microscope-inspection-of-scratch-patterns-abrasive-testing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/microscope-inspection-of-scratch-patterns-abrasive-testing/cards/pinterest/microscope-inspection-of-scratch-patterns-abrasive-testing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/microscope-inspection-of-scratch-patterns-abrasive-testing/cards/facebook/microscope-inspection-of-scratch-patterns-abrasive-testing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/microscope-inspection-of-scratch-patterns-abrasive-testing/cards/facebook/microscope-inspection-of-scratch-patterns-abrasive-testing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/microscope-inspection-of-scratch-patterns-abrasive-testing/cards/facebook/microscope-inspection-of-scratch-patterns-abrasive-testing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Wrap Sandpaper Around Dowels For Curved Edges</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 05 Dec 2025 13:37:54 +0000</pubDate><category>Hand Sanding Techniques</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Practical guide to hand sanding curved edges by wrapping sandpaper around dowels; testing abrasives, grits, and jigs for consistent radii.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="hand-sanding-curves-wrap-paper-around-dowels"&gt;Hand Sanding Curves: Wrap Paper Around Dowels&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember the first time a curve made me question my craft. It was a walnut keepsake box with a lid that looked perfect on CAD: a soft 10 mm radius running cleanly along all four edges. On the bench, though, the radius fought back. My block sander flattened the apex, my random-orbit sander skated off the edge, and every “shortcut” I tried left flats and chatter marks that showed up under finish like neon. I finally reached for the simplest tool in the shop: a hardwood dowel, a strip of abrasive, and my hands. With careful hand sanding—wrapping the paper around a dowel that matched the profile—the radius began to read as a continuous curve instead of a sequence of mistakes. The tactile feedback told me where the high spots were; the scratch pattern told me when I was pushing too hard.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/02.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding/cards/instagram/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding/cards/instagram/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding/cards/instagram/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding/cards/pinterest/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding/cards/pinterest/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding/cards/pinterest/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Reusable Sponges To Reduce Waste</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 17:37:43 +0000</pubDate><category>Eco &amp; Non-Toxic Abrasives</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>dry sanding</category><category>paint prep</category><category>dust control</category><category>joint compound</category><description>Expert guide to eco sandpaper and reusable sponges: prep, grit strategy, cleaning cycles, and workflows that reduce waste without compromising finish.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="eco-sandpaper-and-reusable-sanding-sponges"&gt;Eco sandpaper and reusable sanding sponges&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a Saturday morning, I stood over a maple desk that had seen too many years of coffee rings and hurried notes. The sun cut across the shop floor, catching dust motes suspended in a quiet orbit around the project that would—if I did this right—become an heirloom. Next to me sat a half-empty box of worn paper sheets and a small pile of discarded grits I’d promised myself I’d send to recycling (a promise I rarely kept). It felt familiar and a little defeating: endless sheets, clogged in minutes, and a small mountain of waste. That was the morning I switched the workflow, integrating reusable sanding sponges and eco sandpaper into a process designed not just for finish quality, but for sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/29.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper/cards/instagram/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper/cards/instagram/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper/cards/instagram/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Backing Pad Compatibility Issues</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/backing-pad-compatibility-issues-best-sandpaper-brand/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/backing-pad-compatibility-issues-best-sandpaper-brand/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 15:50:39 +0000</pubDate><category>Brand &amp; Quality Comparison</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Understand backing pad compatibility and the best sandpaper brand for your sander.

&lt;p&gt;You know the moment I mean: the shop is quiet except for the hum of your sander, the piece is clamped and ready, and you’re thinking about finish, not failure. Then the disc starts to lift at the edge, or the sander chatters, leaving tiny half-moons where there should be a smooth, steady haze. In that split second, your focus moves from the project to the pad. If you’ve ever searched for the best sandpaper brand to “fix it,” you’ve probably noticed that the real story is compatibility—how your backing pad and abrasive actually work together.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/27.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/backing-pad-compatibility-issues-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/facebook/backing-pad-compatibility-issues-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/backing-pad-compatibility-issues-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/facebook/backing-pad-compatibility-issues-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/backing-pad-compatibility-issues-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/facebook/backing-pad-compatibility-issues-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/backing-pad-compatibility-issues-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/instagram/backing-pad-compatibility-issues-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/backing-pad-compatibility-issues-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/instagram/backing-pad-compatibility-issues-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/backing-pad-compatibility-issues-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/instagram/backing-pad-compatibility-issues-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/backing-pad-compatibility-issues-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/pinterest/backing-pad-compatibility-issues-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/backing-pad-compatibility-issues-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/pinterest/backing-pad-compatibility-issues-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/backing-pad-compatibility-issues-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/pinterest/backing-pad-compatibility-issues-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/backing-pad-compatibility-issues-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/facebook/backing-pad-compatibility-issues-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/backing-pad-compatibility-issues-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/facebook/backing-pad-compatibility-issues-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/backing-pad-compatibility-issues-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/facebook/backing-pad-compatibility-issues-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Stearated Coatings For Load Resistance</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/stearated-coatings-for-load-resistance-open-coat-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/stearated-coatings-for-load-resistance-open-coat-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 14:21:48 +0000</pubDate><category>Backing Types &amp; Coatings</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-220</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>Beat clogging and heat.

&lt;p&gt;It’s Saturday morning in the shop—the kind where the coffee cools on the bench because you’re in a flow state. You square up your random-orbit sander over a pine cabinet door you’ve been meaning to refinish. Two passes in, the pad stalls, dust smears into a chalky cake, and the disc stops cutting. We’ve all been there: soft wood, resin pockets, a touch of old varnish, and sandpaper that loads up faster than you can tap it clean. That’s when I reach for open coat sandpaper paired with a stearated coating. It’s the combination that keeps abrasive cutting edges exposed while a dry “lubricant” layer sheds paint, pitch, and finish dust instead of letting it fuse to the grit.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/25.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/stearated-coatings-for-load-resistance-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/stearated-coatings-for-load-resistance-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/stearated-coatings-for-load-resistance-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/stearated-coatings-for-load-resistance-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/stearated-coatings-for-load-resistance-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/stearated-coatings-for-load-resistance-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/stearated-coatings-for-load-resistance-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/instagram/stearated-coatings-for-load-resistance-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/stearated-coatings-for-load-resistance-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/instagram/stearated-coatings-for-load-resistance-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/stearated-coatings-for-load-resistance-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/instagram/stearated-coatings-for-load-resistance-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/stearated-coatings-for-load-resistance-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/stearated-coatings-for-load-resistance-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/stearated-coatings-for-load-resistance-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/stearated-coatings-for-load-resistance-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/stearated-coatings-for-load-resistance-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/stearated-coatings-for-load-resistance-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/stearated-coatings-for-load-resistance-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/stearated-coatings-for-load-resistance-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/stearated-coatings-for-load-resistance-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/stearated-coatings-for-load-resistance-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/stearated-coatings-for-load-resistance-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/stearated-coatings-for-load-resistance-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Open Coat Versus Closed Coat Impacts</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 13:41:49 +0000</pubDate><category>Abrasive Materials &amp; Compounds</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-1200</category><description>Open vs closed coat sanding explained with lab-tested data.

&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning in the shop is supposed to be simple: one mug of coffee, a walnut desktop to final-sand, and a couple of hours of quiet before the house wakes up. Instead, at pass number fifteen, the paper glazes over. The dust lines smear into the grain, and the sander’s pitch changes—a small but telling protest. I switch sheets, still chasing that consistent, haze-free scratch pattern. When I move to wet-sand a lacquer test panel, silicon carbide sandpaper comes out of the drawer—its black grit and smooth backing a distinct contrast to the tan aluminum oxide I’ve used on the walnut. Ten minutes later, I’m flattening a glued-up end-grain cutting board, then stepping over to clean up a steel plane body. Same sander, same operator, but suddenly my results diverge depending on one detail I often overlook: how densely the abrasive grains were packed onto the paper in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/23.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/instagram/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/instagram/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/instagram/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Slurry Management During Wet Grinding</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/03/slurry-management-during-wet-grinding-concrete-polishing/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/03/slurry-management-during-wet-grinding-concrete-polishing/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 03 Dec 2025 13:41:04 +0000</pubDate><category>Stone &amp; Concrete Polishing</category><category>grit-40</category><category>grit-70</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Learn expert slurry management for wet grinding and concrete polishing—chemistry, tooling, workflow, and compliance to deliver consistent, high-gloss floors.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="wet-grinding-slurry-control-for-concrete-polishing"&gt;Wet Grinding Slurry Control for Concrete Polishing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s 6:10 a.m. in a silent warehouse. Air is cool, lights are still buzzing to full brightness, and the crew is rolling out hoses and laying edge-protection mats with the practiced choreography of a hundred previous jobs. The general contractor walks the space with a client, tracing imagined traffic patterns in the air: this will be a public lobby, high reflectivity, no coating, a breathable sheen that wears in gracefully, not off in flakes. On-site expectations like these live or die by process discipline. Everyone agrees on the end state—clean clarity, sharp aggregate reveal—but the real determinant of that result begins long before the burnish. It starts with water, abrasives, and the wet byproduct the team will generate hour after hour. It starts with slurry.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/21.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/03/slurry-management-during-wet-grinding-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/slurry-management-during-wet-grinding-concrete-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/03/slurry-management-during-wet-grinding-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/slurry-management-during-wet-grinding-concrete-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/03/slurry-management-during-wet-grinding-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/slurry-management-during-wet-grinding-concrete-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/03/slurry-management-during-wet-grinding-concrete-polishing/cards/instagram/slurry-management-during-wet-grinding-concrete-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/03/slurry-management-during-wet-grinding-concrete-polishing/cards/instagram/slurry-management-during-wet-grinding-concrete-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/03/slurry-management-during-wet-grinding-concrete-polishing/cards/instagram/slurry-management-during-wet-grinding-concrete-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/03/slurry-management-during-wet-grinding-concrete-polishing/cards/pinterest/slurry-management-during-wet-grinding-concrete-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/03/slurry-management-during-wet-grinding-concrete-polishing/cards/pinterest/slurry-management-during-wet-grinding-concrete-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/03/slurry-management-during-wet-grinding-concrete-polishing/cards/pinterest/slurry-management-during-wet-grinding-concrete-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/03/slurry-management-during-wet-grinding-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/slurry-management-during-wet-grinding-concrete-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/03/slurry-management-during-wet-grinding-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/slurry-management-during-wet-grinding-concrete-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/03/slurry-management-during-wet-grinding-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/slurry-management-during-wet-grinding-concrete-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Smooth Fairing Compound Before Primer</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/02/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/02/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 02 Dec 2025 13:43:25 +0000</pubDate><category>Marine Sanding</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>dry sanding</category><category>primer coat</category><description>Master boat sanding and fairing for a glass-smooth base before primer.

&lt;p&gt;You can hear it before you see it: the soft rasp of paper across gelcoat, the shush-shush rhythm that turns a scuffed hull into something you can be proud of. Boat sanding isn’t exactly glamorous, but on a still morning—coffee perched on a dock post, gulls trading gossip overhead—it feels like craft. Your fingers become the first inspectors, gliding across highs and lows. The goal isn’t just clean; it’s consistent. When you’re aiming for smooth fairing compound before primer, you’re making a commitment to what comes next: paint that lays down like glass, reflections that don’t ripple, and time on the water that starts sooner because you did the prep right.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/19.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/02/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/02/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/02/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/02/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding/cards/instagram/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/02/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding/cards/instagram/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/02/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding/cards/instagram/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/02/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding/cards/pinterest/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/02/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding/cards/pinterest/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/02/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding/cards/pinterest/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/02/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/02/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/02/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Reduce Chipping With Light Pressure</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 01 Dec 2025 17:57:57 +0000</pubDate><category>Glass &amp; Ceramics Sanding</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-1200</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>Learn glass sanding techniques to prevent chipping.

&lt;p&gt;The first clink is always the loudest. You set the pane on a padded bench, nudge it into square, and that tiny tick of glass on glass makes your shoulders tense. If you’ve worked with glass—bottles you’ve upcycled, aquarium panels you’ve drilled, a mirror you’ve cut—you know the feeling. The fear isn’t shattering; it’s those sneaky micro-chips that show up right when you’re almost done. The good news is we can control them. With glass sanding done right and a feather-light touch, you’ll get clean edges that don’t snowflake into chips, even under stress.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/17.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding/cards/instagram/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding/cards/instagram/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding/cards/instagram/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding/cards/pinterest/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding/cards/pinterest/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding/cards/pinterest/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Avoid Overheating Edges During Polish</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/avoid-overheating-edges-during-polish-resin-polishing/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/avoid-overheating-edges-during-polish-resin-polishing/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 01 Dec 2025 16:10:07 +0000</pubDate><category>Resin Polishing</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>wet sanding</category><description>Engineer-tested methods to keep resin edges cool while polishing.

&lt;p&gt;The first time I overheated a resin edge, it looked perfect—right up until it wasn’t. The surface was glossy, but the perimeter turned milky, then smeared like warm butter under a rotary pad. I could smell the polymer heating. It felt like a setback on a simple task: sanding and finishing a handmade resin coaster. If you’ve been there, you know the mix of frustration and “what did I do wrong?” It’s not lack of care; it’s physics. That edge has less mass to absorb heat, and during resin polishing you’re pushing friction and pressure into a tiny contact patch. Heat has nowhere to go.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/15.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/avoid-overheating-edges-during-polish-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/avoid-overheating-edges-during-polish-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/avoid-overheating-edges-during-polish-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/avoid-overheating-edges-during-polish-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/avoid-overheating-edges-during-polish-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/avoid-overheating-edges-during-polish-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/avoid-overheating-edges-during-polish-resin-polishing/cards/instagram/avoid-overheating-edges-during-polish-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/avoid-overheating-edges-during-polish-resin-polishing/cards/instagram/avoid-overheating-edges-during-polish-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/avoid-overheating-edges-during-polish-resin-polishing/cards/instagram/avoid-overheating-edges-during-polish-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/avoid-overheating-edges-during-polish-resin-polishing/cards/pinterest/avoid-overheating-edges-during-polish-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/avoid-overheating-edges-during-polish-resin-polishing/cards/pinterest/avoid-overheating-edges-during-polish-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/avoid-overheating-edges-during-polish-resin-polishing/cards/pinterest/avoid-overheating-edges-during-polish-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/avoid-overheating-edges-during-polish-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/avoid-overheating-edges-during-polish-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/avoid-overheating-edges-during-polish-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/avoid-overheating-edges-during-polish-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/avoid-overheating-edges-during-polish-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/avoid-overheating-edges-during-polish-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Refine To 2000–3000 For Quick Polish</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 01 Dec 2025 15:17:23 +0000</pubDate><category>Plastic &amp; Epoxy Sanding</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>Master epoxy sanding from 800 to 2000–3000 grit for a fast, haze-free polish with pro-level technique, abrasives, and workflow control.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="epoxy-sanding-quick-polish-at-20003000-grit"&gt;Epoxy Sanding: Quick Polish at 2000–3000 Grit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You set the project down with both hands, the way you place a full coffee mug on a brand-new table—carefully, like it could bruise. Yesterday it was a cloudy slab: dust nibs, tiny ripples, a faint orange peel. Today, it’s close. Under the shop LEDs, you can already see straight lines in the reflection, but not a perfect mirror—still a little fog, still a couple of shallow witness lines that your eyes keep returning to. The moment is tempting: grab a compound and try to bully the gloss into existence. But you’ve done this long enough to know that shine doesn’t come from polish alone; it’s earned in the scratch pattern. This is where epoxy sanding decides whether you’ll be buffing for minutes or for hours, whether the finish will hold up in sunlight or betray you with haloed swirls.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/13.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding/cards/instagram/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding/cards/instagram/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding/cards/instagram/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding/cards/pinterest/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding/cards/pinterest/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding/cards/pinterest/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>When To Choose Trizact Style Abrasives</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 01 Dec 2025 13:40:34 +0000</pubDate><category>Specialty Abrasives</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Learn when to choose Trizact style abrasives vs microfinishing film.

&lt;p&gt;The shop is quiet in the way only focused work can create—overhead lights humming, a small radio whispering in the corner, and the soft, steady rasp of a belt skimming steel. You’ve shaped a kitchen knife from bar stock, or maybe you’re prepping a classic car panel after welding in a patch. The hard work is done, but the finish is still miles away from what you picture: clean, even, and confident. You swap belts, try a different disc, lighten pressure, and still those stubborn lines hang on. Do you step to a more aggressive grit? Switch to a finer one? Or change the abrasive altogether?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/11.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film/cards/instagram/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film/cards/instagram/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film/cards/instagram/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film/cards/pinterest/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film/cards/pinterest/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film/cards/pinterest/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Wet Sanding Sequence 1000 To 3000 Grit</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/30/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/30/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 30 Nov 2025 13:32:41 +0000</pubDate><category>Waterproof &amp; Wet/Dry Paper</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-2500</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>clear coat</category><category>dry sanding</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Learn a pro-approved wet sanding sequence from 1000 to 3000 grit using wet dry sandpaper.

&lt;p&gt;The garage is quiet except for the steady drip from a hose into a plastic pail. You’ve taped off the washer nozzles, masked the edges, and laid out your gear like a surgeon. A foam block, a spray bottle with soapy water, microfiber towels, and a neat stack of wet dry sandpaper—1000, 2000, and 3000 grit—each sheet pre-cut and soaking. If you’ve ever stared at a hood that looked great at sunset but awful under the driveway floodlight—orange peel, dust nibs, faint sanding traces from an old repair—you know the itch to fix it properly. Today’s the day you turn that itch into an even, glassy finish with a controlled wet sanding sequence from 1000 to 3000 grit.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/09.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/30/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/30/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/30/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/30/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/instagram/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/30/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/instagram/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/30/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/instagram/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/30/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/30/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/30/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/30/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/30/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/30/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Pair Ceramics With Dust Extraction</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/29/pair-ceramics-with-dust-extraction-ceramic-sanding-discs/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/29/pair-ceramics-with-dust-extraction-ceramic-sanding-discs/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 29 Nov 2025 13:31:32 +0000</pubDate><category>Ceramic &amp; Premium Abrasives</category><category>grit-400</category><description>Engineer-tested guide to pairing ceramic sanding discs with dust extraction for cleaner air, longer disc life, and faster, cooler cuts on wood, metal, and</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="ceramic-sanding-discs-and-dust-extraction-guide"&gt;Ceramic Sanding Discs and Dust Extraction Guide&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s 7:10 p.m. in the garage, and you’re chasing the last coat-leveling pass on a maple tabletop. The light catches a swirl here, a rough patch there—and a cloud of fine dust that you don’t fully register until the sharp smell of lignin and heat hits. You stop to wipe your safety glasses, but the haze hangs on. The disc feels glazed, the sander runs hotter, and progress slows. I’ve been there dozens of times. Switching to a better abrasive helps, but the real unlock came when I paired high-performance ceramic sanding discs with a properly tuned dust extraction setup. The first night I dialed it in, the air stayed clear, the finish looked even, and my disc cut like it was fresh—for far longer than I expected.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/07.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/29/pair-ceramics-with-dust-extraction-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/pair-ceramics-with-dust-extraction-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/29/pair-ceramics-with-dust-extraction-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/pair-ceramics-with-dust-extraction-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/29/pair-ceramics-with-dust-extraction-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/pair-ceramics-with-dust-extraction-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/29/pair-ceramics-with-dust-extraction-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/pair-ceramics-with-dust-extraction-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/29/pair-ceramics-with-dust-extraction-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/pair-ceramics-with-dust-extraction-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/29/pair-ceramics-with-dust-extraction-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/pair-ceramics-with-dust-extraction-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/29/pair-ceramics-with-dust-extraction-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/pair-ceramics-with-dust-extraction-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/29/pair-ceramics-with-dust-extraction-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/pair-ceramics-with-dust-extraction-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/29/pair-ceramics-with-dust-extraction-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/pair-ceramics-with-dust-extraction-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/29/pair-ceramics-with-dust-extraction-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/pair-ceramics-with-dust-extraction-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/29/pair-ceramics-with-dust-extraction-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/pair-ceramics-with-dust-extraction-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/29/pair-ceramics-with-dust-extraction-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/pair-ceramics-with-dust-extraction-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item></channel></rss>

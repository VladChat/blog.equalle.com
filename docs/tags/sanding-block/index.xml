&lt;p&gt;You can hear a project before you see it: the whine of an orbital sander, the hiss of a dust extractor, the rasp of grit carving tracks in an old finish. The other soundtrack is a quiet shop, drop cloths taped down, a gelled stripper turning tired paint into ribbons under a plastic scraper. Both are valid approaches to surface preparation, and the results hinge on choosing the right path at the outset. The paint stripping vs sanding decision is less about preference and more about material science, coating behavior, and the downstream finish you expect. If you’re staring at a five-layer porch rail, a veneered dresser, or a fiberglass hatch, the fastest route to a clean, profile-ready surface may not be the one you think.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/10.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding/cards/instagram/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding/cards/instagram/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding/cards/instagram/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding/cards/pinterest/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding/cards/pinterest/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding/cards/pinterest/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Compare Scratch Depth At Equal Grits</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/compare-scratch-depth-at-equal-grits-abrasive-testing/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/compare-scratch-depth-at-equal-grits-abrasive-testing/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 21 Nov 2025 02:06:34 +0000</pubDate><category>Abrasive Innovation &amp; Testing</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-220</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>sanding block</category><description>Learn how to compare scratch depth at equal grits with practical abrasive testing, real workshop steps, and pro tips for wood, metal, and composites.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="abrasive-testing-compare-scratch-depth-at-equal-grits"&gt;Abrasive Testing: Compare Scratch Depth at Equal Grits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It starts the same way in every shop: coffee cooling on the bench, clamp marks still fresh on yesterday’s glue-up, and a stack of sandpaper cut into tidy quarters. You grab two sheets—both labeled 220 grit—because today you’re chasing a clean, consistent surface on a walnut tabletop that deserves better than swirl marks. Ten strokes in, the sheen looks different between sheets. You can feel it with your fingertips too—one side looks hazier, slightly more torn up, and the grain lines pop in a way that screams “deeper scratches.” Both sheets claim the same grit number, so why the mismatch? That’s the kind of moment that sends me down the rabbit hole of abrasive testing.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/19.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/compare-scratch-depth-at-equal-grits-abrasive-testing/cards/facebook/compare-scratch-depth-at-equal-grits-abrasive-testing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/compare-scratch-depth-at-equal-grits-abrasive-testing/cards/facebook/compare-scratch-depth-at-equal-grits-abrasive-testing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/compare-scratch-depth-at-equal-grits-abrasive-testing/cards/facebook/compare-scratch-depth-at-equal-grits-abrasive-testing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/compare-scratch-depth-at-equal-grits-abrasive-testing/cards/instagram/compare-scratch-depth-at-equal-grits-abrasive-testing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/compare-scratch-depth-at-equal-grits-abrasive-testing/cards/instagram/compare-scratch-depth-at-equal-grits-abrasive-testing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/compare-scratch-depth-at-equal-grits-abrasive-testing/cards/instagram/compare-scratch-depth-at-equal-grits-abrasive-testing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/compare-scratch-depth-at-equal-grits-abrasive-testing/cards/pinterest/compare-scratch-depth-at-equal-grits-abrasive-testing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/compare-scratch-depth-at-equal-grits-abrasive-testing/cards/pinterest/compare-scratch-depth-at-equal-grits-abrasive-testing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/compare-scratch-depth-at-equal-grits-abrasive-testing/cards/pinterest/compare-scratch-depth-at-equal-grits-abrasive-testing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/compare-scratch-depth-at-equal-grits-abrasive-testing/cards/facebook/compare-scratch-depth-at-equal-grits-abrasive-testing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/compare-scratch-depth-at-equal-grits-abrasive-testing/cards/facebook/compare-scratch-depth-at-equal-grits-abrasive-testing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/compare-scratch-depth-at-equal-grits-abrasive-testing/cards/facebook/compare-scratch-depth-at-equal-grits-abrasive-testing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Paper Weight And Flexibility Differences</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/paper-weight-and-flexibility-differences-open-coat-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/paper-weight-and-flexibility-differences-open-coat-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2025 05:56:56 +0000</pubDate><category>Backing Types &amp; Coatings</category><category>grit-150</category><category>orbital sander</category><category>sanding block</category><category>grit progression</category><category>wet sanding</category><description>Understand paper weight, flexibility, and when to use open coat sandpaper for cleaner cuts, fewer clogs, and pro-grade finishes in wood and metalwork.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="open-coat-sandpaper-paper-weight-and-flexibility"&gt;Open Coat Sandpaper, Paper Weight, and Flexibility&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning, mug of coffee steaming on the bench. The shop is still cool, and the only sound is your block plane sliding across a maple board. You’re smoothing a reclaimed slab into a dining table that has to look heirloom, not “weekend project.” You switch to abrasive work—this is where most projects are won or lost. Pull a sheet from the drawer and you can tell instantly: too stiff and it will flatten the gentle chamfer you’ve planed; too flimsy and it will telegraph every ridge from your fingertips. You also know the species: maple burns if you let a clogged sheet skate across it. That’s where choice matters—paper weight, flexibility, and whether open coat sandpaper will let the dust clear instead of loading the sheet like wet snow on a shovel.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/11.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/paper-weight-and-flexibility-differences-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/paper-weight-and-flexibility-differences-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/paper-weight-and-flexibility-differences-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/paper-weight-and-flexibility-differences-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/paper-weight-and-flexibility-differences-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/paper-weight-and-flexibility-differences-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/paper-weight-and-flexibility-differences-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/instagram/paper-weight-and-flexibility-differences-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/paper-weight-and-flexibility-differences-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/instagram/paper-weight-and-flexibility-differences-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/paper-weight-and-flexibility-differences-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/instagram/paper-weight-and-flexibility-differences-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/paper-weight-and-flexibility-differences-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/paper-weight-and-flexibility-differences-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/paper-weight-and-flexibility-differences-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/paper-weight-and-flexibility-differences-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/paper-weight-and-flexibility-differences-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/paper-weight-and-flexibility-differences-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/paper-weight-and-flexibility-differences-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/paper-weight-and-flexibility-differences-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/paper-weight-and-flexibility-differences-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/paper-weight-and-flexibility-differences-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/paper-weight-and-flexibility-differences-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/paper-weight-and-flexibility-differences-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Choose Pad And Compound For Plastics</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 13:37:22 +0000</pubDate><category>Resin Polishing</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>grit progression</category><category>sanding block</category><category>polishing pads</category><description>Engineer’s guide to resin polishing: pick the right pad and compound for acrylic, polycarbonate, and epoxy.

&lt;p&gt;On a quiet Saturday, I watched a friend slowly lower a buffing pad onto the cloudy edge of his epoxy river table. The coffee mugs had left fine scuffs; sunlight turned them into halos. He’d already tried an all-purpose metal polish and a “universal” wool pad—both grabbed hard, smeared the surface, and left the epoxy warmer than I liked. He looked at me and asked the question I hear weekly: “Which pad and which compound do I actually use for plastics?” It’s an honest question with costly consequences if you guess wrong. Unlike metal paint systems that tolerate a surprising amount of heat and pressure, plastics and cured resins can haze, smear, or stress-craze from a few seconds of the wrong contact.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/01.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/cards/instagram/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/cards/instagram/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/cards/instagram/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/cards/pinterest/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/cards/pinterest/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/cards/pinterest/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>13</readingTime></item><item><title>Flush Slurry To Prevent Loading</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/16/flush-slurry-to-prevent-loading-wet-dry-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/16/flush-slurry-to-prevent-loading-wet-dry-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 16 Nov 2025 15:10:09 +0000</pubDate><category>Waterproof &amp; Wet/Dry Paper</category><category>grit-280</category><category>clear coat</category><category>grit progression</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>sanding block</category><description>Learn how to flush slurry to prevent loading with wet dry sandpaper.

&lt;p&gt;The first time I noticed loading, I was hunched over a maple cutting board in a chilly garage, chasing a glass-smooth finish that never seemed to arrive. The sandpaper was supposed to be “the good stuff,” and I was stepping through the grits like a textbook. But after a few strokes, the sheet glazed over. Instead of cutting, it skated—leaving faint scorch marks and a haze of streaks. I swapped sheets, pressed harder, tried angles. Same story: the paper clogged, and the surface got warmer. That’s when the lightbulb went off. It wasn’t the grit. It wasn’t the wood. It was the slurry—swarf, resin, and water—hanging around and turning my abrasive into a slick.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/24.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/16/flush-slurry-to-prevent-loading-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/flush-slurry-to-prevent-loading-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/16/flush-slurry-to-prevent-loading-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/flush-slurry-to-prevent-loading-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/16/flush-slurry-to-prevent-loading-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/flush-slurry-to-prevent-loading-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/16/flush-slurry-to-prevent-loading-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/instagram/flush-slurry-to-prevent-loading-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/16/flush-slurry-to-prevent-loading-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/instagram/flush-slurry-to-prevent-loading-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/16/flush-slurry-to-prevent-loading-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/instagram/flush-slurry-to-prevent-loading-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/16/flush-slurry-to-prevent-loading-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/flush-slurry-to-prevent-loading-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/16/flush-slurry-to-prevent-loading-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/flush-slurry-to-prevent-loading-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/16/flush-slurry-to-prevent-loading-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/flush-slurry-to-prevent-loading-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/16/flush-slurry-to-prevent-loading-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/flush-slurry-to-prevent-loading-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/16/flush-slurry-to-prevent-loading-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/flush-slurry-to-prevent-loading-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/16/flush-slurry-to-prevent-loading-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/flush-slurry-to-prevent-loading-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Choose Cork Or Rubber Blocks For Even Pressure</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 16:32:32 +0000</pubDate><category>Sanding Blocks</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>sanding block</category><description>Decide between cork and rubber sanding block for even pressure.

&lt;p&gt;You feel it before you see it: the drag of abrasive across primer, the subtle chatter in your wrist, the way dust plumes differently at the edge than it does in the center. The project might be a cabinet door with raised panels, an automotive quarter panel wearing its first coat of high-build, or a mid-century tabletop with a veneer you refuse to risk. Regardless of the substrate, the instrument in your hand—a sanding block—is the difference between flat and faceted, between crisp and crowned. When the pressure is wrong, the finish is wrong. The telltale symptoms appear later: telegraphed low spots under gloss, rounded edges where a sharp reveal should live, swirl hazing that refuses to die at the next grit.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/04.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/cards/facebook/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/cards/facebook/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/cards/facebook/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/cards/instagram/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/cards/instagram/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/cards/instagram/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/cards/facebook/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/cards/facebook/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/cards/facebook/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>13</readingTime></item><item><title>Choose Wool Foam Or Microfiber Pads</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 16:03:08 +0000</pubDate><category>Polishing &amp; Finishing</category><category>mirror finish</category><category>polishing pads</category><category>grit progression</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-2500</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>clear coat</category><category>sanding block</category><description>Engineer-tested guide to choosing wool, foam, or microfiber pads—and when to pair them with polishing sandpaper—for faster, safer, glossier results.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-with-polishing-sandpaper"&gt;Wool, Foam, or Microfiber Pads with Polishing Sandpaper&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a quiet Saturday morning, you tape off the trim, load your polisher, and stare at the paint under bright LEDs. Swirls dance across the clear coat, with a few deeper scratches that refuse to disappear. You’ve got compounds lined up, pads sorted into neatly labeled bins, and sheets of polishing sandpaper ready if the defects demand leveling. Yet the question lingers: which pad material will get you there fastest, without overheating, over-thinning the clear, or leaving haze to chase?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/27.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper/cards/instagram/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper/cards/instagram/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper/cards/instagram/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Strip Failing Polyurethane Then Sand Residue Before Refinishing</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 13:37:09 +0000</pubDate><category>Paint Removal &amp; Surface Prep</category><category>paint prep</category><category>rust removal</category><category>primer coat</category><category>sanding block</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-1500</category><description>Learn expert steps for coating removal, sanding residue, and refinishing wood for durable, beautiful results with safe methods, tools, and pro tips.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="coating-removal-and-refinishing-failing-polyurethane"&gt;Coating Removal and Refinishing Failing Polyurethane&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning light spilled across the dining table you’ve hosted around for years. You set down a mug and notice the surface clings just a little; a ring remains, faint but stubborn. Along the edges, the once-smooth finish has turned brittle and chalky, tiny flakes catching the light like dust motes in motion. You run a fingertip across the spot where a placemat lives—glossy here, dull there, with a subtle ridge between. The finish is failing, and it’s happening faster than you’d like. You can feel the stakes: this is not just a table—it’s family dinners, late-night projects, first-day-of-school photos, and the clean expanse that makes a home feel ready.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/23.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal/cards/facebook/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal/cards/facebook/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal/cards/facebook/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal/cards/instagram/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal/cards/instagram/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal/cards/instagram/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal/cards/pinterest/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal/cards/pinterest/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal/cards/pinterest/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal/cards/facebook/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal/cards/facebook/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal/cards/facebook/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>How To Level Uneven Wood Panels By Sanding Only</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-level-uneven-wood-panels-by-sanding-only-surface-leveling/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-level-uneven-wood-panels-by-sanding-only-surface-leveling/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2025 14:29:42 +0000</pubDate><category>Wood sanding</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-500</category><category>sanding block</category><category>dust control</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Learn pro sanding techniques for surface leveling.

&lt;p&gt;On a cool Saturday morning, your glue-up looks perfect from three paces away. The seams are tight, the grain lines match, and you’re already picturing the finish. Then the raking light hits—tiny ridges, a clamp bump here, a cup there. You run a straightedge across and hear that hollow tick in the middle. No planer, no drum sander, and only the shop basics on your bench. This is where the craft begins, not where it ends. With deliberate handwork, smart tool choice, and disciplined grit progression, you can achieve precise surface leveling using sanding alone. The key is to treat the panel like a system: track where the highs are, remove stock only where you must, and lock in flatness before you chase scratches. If your project is an heirloom tabletop or a cabinet door set, your workflow doesn’t change much—what changes is your patience and how clearly you can “see” the surface as you sand. I’ll show you my repeatable process for flattening panels by hand, with nothing more than sandpaper, a few blocks, and a healthy respect for dust control and measurement. You’ll learn to read the wood, choose the right grit sequences, and avoid common traps like rolling edges or leaving a subtle dish that ruins your finish. This is hands-on, no-nonsense surface leveling tailored for real shops and real projects.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-level-uneven-wood-panels-by-sanding-only-surface-leveling/cards/facebook/how-to-level-uneven-wood-panels-by-sanding-only-surface-leveling.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-level-uneven-wood-panels-by-sanding-only-surface-leveling/cards/facebook/how-to-level-uneven-wood-panels-by-sanding-only-surface-leveling.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-level-uneven-wood-panels-by-sanding-only-surface-leveling/cards/facebook/how-to-level-uneven-wood-panels-by-sanding-only-surface-leveling.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-level-uneven-wood-panels-by-sanding-only-surface-leveling/cards/instagram/how-to-level-uneven-wood-panels-by-sanding-only-surface-leveling.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-level-uneven-wood-panels-by-sanding-only-surface-leveling/cards/instagram/how-to-level-uneven-wood-panels-by-sanding-only-surface-leveling.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-level-uneven-wood-panels-by-sanding-only-surface-leveling/cards/instagram/how-to-level-uneven-wood-panels-by-sanding-only-surface-leveling.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-level-uneven-wood-panels-by-sanding-only-surface-leveling/cards/pinterest/how-to-level-uneven-wood-panels-by-sanding-only-surface-leveling.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-level-uneven-wood-panels-by-sanding-only-surface-leveling/cards/pinterest/how-to-level-uneven-wood-panels-by-sanding-only-surface-leveling.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-level-uneven-wood-panels-by-sanding-only-surface-leveling/cards/pinterest/how-to-level-uneven-wood-panels-by-sanding-only-surface-leveling.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-level-uneven-wood-panels-by-sanding-only-surface-leveling/cards/facebook/how-to-level-uneven-wood-panels-by-sanding-only-surface-leveling.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-level-uneven-wood-panels-by-sanding-only-surface-leveling/cards/facebook/how-to-level-uneven-wood-panels-by-sanding-only-surface-leveling.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-level-uneven-wood-panels-by-sanding-only-surface-leveling/cards/facebook/how-to-level-uneven-wood-panels-by-sanding-only-surface-leveling.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>9</readingTime></item><item><title>Wet Sanding To Control Marine Dust</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 08 Nov 2025 00:54:10 +0000</pubDate><category>Marine Sanding</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>orbital sander</category><category>dry sanding</category><category>sanding block</category><category>mirror finish</category><description>Learn wet boat sanding to cut toxic dust, protect waterways, and prep your hull right.

&lt;p&gt;There’s a particular quiet to the yard before sunrise. The halyards ping, the coffee steams in a chipped thermos, and the hull you’ve been avoiding stands there like a promise you can’t put off. I’ve been on both sides of that moment—rushing, dusty, and regretting shortcuts later—and the method that changed the game for me was wet boat sanding. Not because it’s pretty, but because it’s efficient, safer for your lungs, and easier to keep the neighbors and the yard manager happy. You control the mess. You protect the water you love. And you end the day with a hull that’s flatter, cooler, and ready to bond.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding/cards/instagram/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding/cards/instagram/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding/cards/instagram/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding/cards/pinterest/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding/cards/pinterest/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding/cards/pinterest/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Soap To Water Ratio For Lubrication</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 07 Nov 2025 14:24:10 +0000</pubDate><category>Waterproof &amp; Wet/Dry Paper</category><category>grit-360</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-1200</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-2500</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>sanding block</category><description>Engineer-tested soap-to-water ratios for lubricating wet dry sandpaper on paint, wood, and metal.

&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning, a quiet garage, and a project you’ve promised yourself you’d finally finish. The headlight lenses are foggy. The table top has those telltale dust nibs in the polyurethane. A chef’s knife hangs dull on the magnetic strip, begging for bite. You fill a bucket, reach for a bottle of soap, and lay out sheets of wet dry sandpaper—ready to get to work. And then you pause. How much soap should actually go into the water? One drop? A teaspoon? More? You’ve heard “soapy water helps it glide,” but glide isn’t the only variable that matters. There’s also bite, swarf transport, scratch control, and heat. The soap-to-water ratio dictates whether you refine fast and clean—or skate on a film that kills cutting speed and blurs feedback.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/instagram/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/instagram/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/instagram/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Choose Hose Diameter For Best Suction</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 06 Nov 2025 14:24:00 +0000</pubDate><category>Dust Extraction Systems</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>dry sanding</category><category>orbital sander</category><category>sanding block</category><category>joint compound</category><description>An engineer’s guide to hose diameter for dustless sanding—get the best suction, cleaner air, and faster finishing with data-driven choices.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="dustless-sanding-pick-the-right-hose-diameter"&gt;Dustless Sanding: Pick the Right Hose Diameter&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first time I tried to sand a maple tabletop in my small garage, I didn’t plan for the dust. Within minutes, a visible cloud hovered over my workbench, the air had that chalky taste, and the light from the door turned into a foggy beam. The sander did its job, but the shop felt uninhabitable. Fast-forward to today, and my setup looks completely different: a quiet extractor hums under the bench, a smooth-bore hose clips into a sander with a snug port connection, and the cleanup is mostly emptying a bag. The shift to dustless sanding wasn’t just about comfort—it was about control. Once you understand how hose diameter, hose length, and vacuum performance interact, you can tune a system that captures chips and submicron dust instead of aerosolizing it.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding/cards/facebook/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding/cards/facebook/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding/cards/facebook/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding/cards/instagram/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding/cards/instagram/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding/cards/instagram/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding/cards/pinterest/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding/cards/pinterest/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding/cards/pinterest/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding/cards/facebook/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding/cards/facebook/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding/cards/facebook/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Keep Surfaces Flat With Rigid Blocks</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 05 Nov 2025 15:23:32 +0000</pubDate><category>Sanding Blocks</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>sanding block</category><description>Learn how rigid sanding blocks keep surfaces flat, when to use them, and the techniques, materials, and tips that deliver flawless, true results.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="keep-surfaces-flat-with-a-rigid-sanding-block"&gt;Keep Surfaces Flat with a Rigid Sanding Block&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a moment in any refinishing project when your eye catches the light just right and you see it: subtle waves in a tabletop, a faint ripple in primer, a break in the reflections across a glossy guitar body. You feel it with your fingertips too—those barely-there rises and dips that make the difference between “good enough” and “crafted.” I remember the first time I noticed how my results changed when I switched from a soft pad to a rigid sanding block. The surface I thought was “close” suddenly told the truth. Within a few careful passes, the highs dulled evenly and the lows showed as untouched pencil marks. In minutes, the surface was flatter than I’d ever achieved before.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/cards/facebook/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/cards/facebook/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/cards/facebook/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/cards/instagram/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/cards/instagram/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/cards/instagram/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/cards/facebook/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/cards/facebook/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/cards/facebook/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>13</readingTime></item><item><title>Best Grit For Sanding Between Coats Of Polyurethane</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 05 Nov 2025 04:59:16 +0000</pubDate><category>Between-Coats Sanding</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>dry sanding</category><category>clear coat</category><category>sanding block</category><description>Learn the best grit for sanding between coats of polyurethane, when to sand, and how to get a flawless, dust-free finish with pro-tested techniques.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="between-coats-sanding-best-grit-for-polyurethane"&gt;Between Coats Sanding: Best Grit for Polyurethane&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first time you run your hand across a newly finished table and feel the faint drag of tiny dust nibs, you understand why the small steps matter. Maybe it’s a maple dining top you’ve been nursing through long evenings, or a simple pine shelf that somehow carries outsized meaning. You’ve brushed on a smooth coat, waited patiently, and yet—under a raking light—tiny specks wink back at you like a constellation you didn’t intend to draw. That’s the moment when many projects turn from “good enough” to “I want this perfect.” And the bridge to perfect is almost always between coats sanding.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding/cards/instagram/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding/cards/instagram/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding/cards/instagram/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding/cards/pinterest/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding/cards/pinterest/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding/cards/pinterest/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Scuff Sand Glossy Paint To Improve Primer Adhesion</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 05 Nov 2025 04:18:59 +0000</pubDate><category>Paint Removal &amp; Surface Prep</category><category>paint prep</category><category>rust removal</category><category>primer coat</category><category>sanding block</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>dust control</category><description>Learn how to scuff sand glossy paint for superior primer adhesion.

&lt;p&gt;There’s a moment every DIYer knows: coffee in hand, paint tray loaded, roller whispering across the wall—and then the dreaded slip. The glossy trim or cabinet door you thought you tamed suddenly sheds the new coat like a rain jacket, beading, sliding, or peeling on touch. I’ve been in that room more times than I can count, from weekend bathrooms to full commercial corridors, and the conclusion’s always the same—before color comes control. That control starts with surface preparation. Not flashy, not glamorous, but it’s the one step that makes every coat after it look better and last longer.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation/cards/facebook/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation/cards/facebook/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation/cards/facebook/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation/cards/instagram/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation/cards/instagram/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation/cards/instagram/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation/cards/pinterest/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation/cards/pinterest/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation/cards/pinterest/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation/cards/facebook/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation/cards/facebook/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation/cards/facebook/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Crosshatch Sanding Pattern For Even Clear Coat Leveling</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 05 Nov 2025 00:59:26 +0000</pubDate><category>Wet Sanding Clear Coat</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-2500</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>clear coat</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>sanding block</category><description>Learn the crosshatch sanding pattern for even clear coat leveling—tools, grits, steps, and pro tips for a flat, glossy, mirror-like finish.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="crosshatch-sanding-for-clear-coat-leveling"&gt;Crosshatch Sanding for Clear Coat Leveling&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You notice it first when the sun dips behind a cloud. Your car—or maybe that guitar body you’ve been refinishing—looked perfect in full daylight. But now a soft, diffused glow reveals a faint orange peel, a sprinkling of swirls, and the slightest rippling along a contour line. It’s not ruined, but it’s not the glassy surface you had in mind. The promise of a flawless finish is what pulls many of us into the workshop on a Saturday morning, and it’s what makes techniques like clear coat leveling feel less like a chore and more like craftsmanship. What you need isn’t more product or a heavier hand; it’s a repeatable way to flatten texture without taking unnecessary risks.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling/cards/facebook/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling/cards/facebook/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling/cards/facebook/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling/cards/instagram/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling/cards/instagram/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling/cards/instagram/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling/cards/pinterest/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling/cards/pinterest/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling/cards/pinterest/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling/cards/facebook/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling/cards/facebook/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling/cards/facebook/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>How To Sand Crown Molding Profiles Without Flattening</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 04 Nov 2025 16:44:08 +0000</pubDate><category>Trim &amp; Molding Sanding</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>sanding block</category><category>primer coat</category><category>dust control</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Learn how to sand crown molding without flattening profiles.

&lt;p&gt;On a quiet Saturday morning, you finally pull the drop cloths over your living room floor and tilt a lamp toward the ceiling. The crown molding looks elegant from a distance, but up close the paint has chipped at the corners and the once-crisp beads have gone a little blurry. You run a fingertip along a cove that should feel like a clean arc, and instead it’s a soft bump. That’s the moment when most DIYers decide to sand—and the moment many profiles lose their sharp character. The goal isn’t to erase the molding’s shape; it’s to refine the surface. With a thoughtful approach to molding sanding, you can keep each flare, bead, and cove true while preparing for a flawless new finish.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding/cards/instagram/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding/cards/instagram/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding/cards/instagram/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>How To Sand Wood By Hand For Smooth Finish</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 04 Nov 2025 03:41:00 +0000</pubDate><category>Hand Sanding Techniques</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>sanding block</category><category>grit progression</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>Learn hand sanding techniques, grit progression, and pro tips to achieve a flawless smooth wood finish with clear steps, tools, and troubleshooting.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="hand-sanding-for-a-glass-smooth-wood-finish"&gt;Hand sanding for a glass-smooth wood finish&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a quiet Saturday morning, the house is still enough to hear the tiny rasp of paper against wood. Sunlight falls across the table you’ve promised to restore—the one that’s been gathering keys, grocery bags, and happy-hour mail for years. At first glance, it seems fine. But run your fingertips from the center to the edge and you can feel a map of dents, glue drips, and faint chatter lines left by the last sander. This is where patience matters. This is where hand sanding earns its reputation.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding/cards/instagram/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding/cards/instagram/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding/cards/instagram/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Low Voc Binder Options For Abrasives</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 04 Nov 2025 03:24:31 +0000</pubDate><category>Eco &amp; Non-Toxic Abrasives</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-800</category><category>sanding block</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>clear coat</category><description>Low-VOC binder guide for eco sandpaper: materials, performance tradeoffs, and a step-by-step shop workflow for cleaner, pro-grade sanding.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="eco-sandpaper-low-voc-binder-options-that-work"&gt;Eco Sandpaper: Low-VOC Binder Options That Work&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know that smell the minute you crack open the shop on a warm morning—the stale bite of solvents baked into the air, the stuff that lingers in your nose long after the last pass with the sanding block. That’s the old world of abrasives talking. As a cabinetmaker turned workshop coach, I’ve logged hundreds of hours testing sheets, belts, and discs that either left my head buzzing or my surfaces butter-smooth. These days, the best of both worlds is real: low-VOC binders in eco sandpaper that can hold grit like a bulldog, resist loading, and let you breathe easier in a small shop without a giant extractor humming all day.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/cards/instagram/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/cards/instagram/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/cards/instagram/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Sic Versus Aluminum Oxide Differences</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 04 Nov 2025 02:51:33 +0000</pubDate><category>Abrasive Materials &amp; Compounds</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>dry sanding</category><category>clear coat</category><category>orbital sander</category><category>sanding block</category><description>Compare silicon carbide sandpaper and aluminum oxide to choose the right abrasive for wood, metal, and paint.

&lt;p&gt;On a quiet Saturday afternoon, you clamp down the last door of that heirloom dresser you’ve been restoring. The grain finally shows through the old varnish, but the surface still isn’t the mirror-smooth finish you pictured. You reach for a fresh sheet, feel the grit with your thumb, and hesitate—this is where the choice between silicon carbide sandpaper and aluminum oxide decides whether you’ll spend the evening admiring your work or chasing scratches you didn’t mean to make. Maybe you’re here because a paint finish went cloudy after dry sanding, or a clear coat took a hopscotch of swirls under shop lights. Or maybe your belt sander chewed through hook-and-loop discs like a wood chipper and you need something tougher and more predictable.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/instagram/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/instagram/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/instagram/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>13</readingTime></item><item><title>Coarse Medium Fine And Ultra Fine Definitions</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/coarse-medium-fine-and-ultra-fine-definitions-sandpaper-grit/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/coarse-medium-fine-and-ultra-fine-definitions-sandpaper-grit/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 05:39:06 +0000</pubDate><category>Grit Range &amp; Classification</category><category>grit-101</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-180</category><category>clear coat</category><category>sanding block</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Understand coarse, medium, fine, and ultra fine sandpaper grit with practical steps, pro tips, and troubleshooting for flawless surfaces.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="coarse-to-ultra-fine-sandpaper-grit-decoded"&gt;Coarse to Ultra Fine: Sandpaper Grit Decoded&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning in the shop. Coffee on the bench, a drop cloth draped over a dented heirloom dresser you promised to rescue. You pull open the top drawer and the musty smell of old lacquer and stubborn pine dust hits the air. A sanding block lies beside a stack of sheets you picked up at the hardware store—some marked 60, others 120, 220, even 400. You know each number stands for a sandpaper grit, but right now they feel like a foreign language. The last time you “winged it,” you left swirl marks that telegraphed straight through your stain, and spent another weekend fixing what you rushed the first time.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/coarse-medium-fine-and-ultra-fine-definitions-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/coarse-medium-fine-and-ultra-fine-definitions-sandpaper-grit.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/coarse-medium-fine-and-ultra-fine-definitions-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/coarse-medium-fine-and-ultra-fine-definitions-sandpaper-grit.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/coarse-medium-fine-and-ultra-fine-definitions-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/coarse-medium-fine-and-ultra-fine-definitions-sandpaper-grit.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/coarse-medium-fine-and-ultra-fine-definitions-sandpaper-grit/cards/instagram/coarse-medium-fine-and-ultra-fine-definitions-sandpaper-grit.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/coarse-medium-fine-and-ultra-fine-definitions-sandpaper-grit/cards/instagram/coarse-medium-fine-and-ultra-fine-definitions-sandpaper-grit.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/coarse-medium-fine-and-ultra-fine-definitions-sandpaper-grit/cards/instagram/coarse-medium-fine-and-ultra-fine-definitions-sandpaper-grit.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/coarse-medium-fine-and-ultra-fine-definitions-sandpaper-grit/cards/pinterest/coarse-medium-fine-and-ultra-fine-definitions-sandpaper-grit.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/coarse-medium-fine-and-ultra-fine-definitions-sandpaper-grit/cards/pinterest/coarse-medium-fine-and-ultra-fine-definitions-sandpaper-grit.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/coarse-medium-fine-and-ultra-fine-definitions-sandpaper-grit/cards/pinterest/coarse-medium-fine-and-ultra-fine-definitions-sandpaper-grit.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/coarse-medium-fine-and-ultra-fine-definitions-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/coarse-medium-fine-and-ultra-fine-definitions-sandpaper-grit.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/coarse-medium-fine-and-ultra-fine-definitions-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/coarse-medium-fine-and-ultra-fine-definitions-sandpaper-grit.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/coarse-medium-fine-and-ultra-fine-definitions-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/coarse-medium-fine-and-ultra-fine-definitions-sandpaper-grit.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>When To Use Sanding Blocks Versus Bare Hand</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 02:57:35 +0000</pubDate><category>Sanding Blocks</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>sanding block</category><category>dry sanding</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Learn when to use a sanding block versus bare-hand sanding for flawless finishes.

&lt;p&gt;The first pass of the evening always tells you how the job will go. You clamp a pine shelf to the bench, switch on the task light, and run your fingertips across a coat of primer that’s not quite right—dust nibs, a few raised grain lines, a ridge where you filled a knot. The shop is quiet except for the small rasp of paper as you tear a new sheet. You think about reaching for your trusty sanding block, the one that’s squared a hundred edges and leveled just as many fills. Then you pause. The shelf has a soft, rounded front, and you can feel a subtle dip near the corner. A hard block might flatten more than you want. Your bare hand, wrapped around a fold of 320-grit, could trace the curve and polish it without flattening the profile. This is the moment that separates a good finish from a great one: choosing the right sanding approach for the surface in front of you.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block/cards/facebook/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block/cards/facebook/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block/cards/facebook/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block/cards/instagram/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block/cards/instagram/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block/cards/instagram/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block/cards/facebook/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block/cards/facebook/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block/cards/facebook/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>13</readingTime></item><item><title>What Grit To Remove Peeling Paint From Wood Trim</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/what-grit-to-remove-peeling-paint-from-wood-trim-paint-removal-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/what-grit-to-remove-peeling-paint-from-wood-trim-paint-removal-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 00:03:42 +0000</pubDate><category>Paint Removal &amp; Surface Prep</category><category>paint prep</category><category>rust removal</category><category>primer coat</category><category>sanding block</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><description>Discover expert tips on paint removal sanding for wood trim.

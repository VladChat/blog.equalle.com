&lt;p&gt;The clamps click loose on a Saturday morning, and the shop exhales. You can smell the faint sweetness of cured glue and yesterday’s coffee. The panel—boards you’ve nursed from rough lumber to edge-jointed strips—comes out of the pipe clamps like a promise. But every promise needs work. There’s a whisper of misalignment at the seams, a few proud edges, maybe a clamp bruise. You don’t own a drum sander, and your benchtop planer isn’t wide enough. Still, the goal doesn’t change: a dead-flat, honest surface that feels like a single piece of wood under your palm.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/25.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/01/flatten-glued-up-panels-with-long-sanding-blocks-surface-leveling/cards/facebook/flatten-glued-up-panels-with-long-sanding-blocks-surface-leveling.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/01/flatten-glued-up-panels-with-long-sanding-blocks-surface-leveling/cards/facebook/flatten-glued-up-panels-with-long-sanding-blocks-surface-leveling.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/01/flatten-glued-up-panels-with-long-sanding-blocks-surface-leveling/cards/facebook/flatten-glued-up-panels-with-long-sanding-blocks-surface-leveling.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/01/flatten-glued-up-panels-with-long-sanding-blocks-surface-leveling/cards/instagram/flatten-glued-up-panels-with-long-sanding-blocks-surface-leveling.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/01/flatten-glued-up-panels-with-long-sanding-blocks-surface-leveling/cards/instagram/flatten-glued-up-panels-with-long-sanding-blocks-surface-leveling.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/01/flatten-glued-up-panels-with-long-sanding-blocks-surface-leveling/cards/instagram/flatten-glued-up-panels-with-long-sanding-blocks-surface-leveling.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/01/flatten-glued-up-panels-with-long-sanding-blocks-surface-leveling/cards/pinterest/flatten-glued-up-panels-with-long-sanding-blocks-surface-leveling.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/01/flatten-glued-up-panels-with-long-sanding-blocks-surface-leveling/cards/pinterest/flatten-glued-up-panels-with-long-sanding-blocks-surface-leveling.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/01/flatten-glued-up-panels-with-long-sanding-blocks-surface-leveling/cards/pinterest/flatten-glued-up-panels-with-long-sanding-blocks-surface-leveling.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/01/flatten-glued-up-panels-with-long-sanding-blocks-surface-leveling/cards/facebook/flatten-glued-up-panels-with-long-sanding-blocks-surface-leveling.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/01/flatten-glued-up-panels-with-long-sanding-blocks-surface-leveling/cards/facebook/flatten-glued-up-panels-with-long-sanding-blocks-surface-leveling.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/01/flatten-glued-up-panels-with-long-sanding-blocks-surface-leveling/cards/facebook/flatten-glued-up-panels-with-long-sanding-blocks-surface-leveling.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Inspect Under Raking Light For Chips</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/27/inspect-under-raking-light-for-chips-glass-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/27/inspect-under-raking-light-for-chips-glass-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 13:54:02 +0000</pubDate><category>Glass &amp; Ceramics Sanding</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1200</category><category>grit progression</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>sanding block</category><description>Learn how to inspect glass under raking light for chips, then repair and polish with controlled glass sanding, grit sequencing, and safety.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="raking-light-inspection-and-glass-sanding-basics"&gt;Raking Light Inspection and Glass Sanding Basics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A scratched backsplash, a hazy edge on a bottle you plan to turn into a lamp, the faint tick of a chip on a shower door—these are small things you don’t notice until the light hits just right. My moment was a kitchen island, late evening, phone flashlight resting on the quartz and aimed low across a new tempered-glass insert. In daylight it looked flawless. Under raking light, it told the truth: a constellation of micro-chips on the cut edge and a faint scratch arc where a coffee grinder once danced. I’ve worked on abrasive systems long enough to know two facts: defects hide in glare, and what you can’t see you can’t control. Raking light is the quickest way to see, and glass sanding—when done deliberately—is how you take control.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/07.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/27/inspect-under-raking-light-for-chips-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/inspect-under-raking-light-for-chips-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/27/inspect-under-raking-light-for-chips-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/inspect-under-raking-light-for-chips-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/27/inspect-under-raking-light-for-chips-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/inspect-under-raking-light-for-chips-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/27/inspect-under-raking-light-for-chips-glass-sanding/cards/instagram/inspect-under-raking-light-for-chips-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/27/inspect-under-raking-light-for-chips-glass-sanding/cards/instagram/inspect-under-raking-light-for-chips-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/27/inspect-under-raking-light-for-chips-glass-sanding/cards/instagram/inspect-under-raking-light-for-chips-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/27/inspect-under-raking-light-for-chips-glass-sanding/cards/pinterest/inspect-under-raking-light-for-chips-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/27/inspect-under-raking-light-for-chips-glass-sanding/cards/pinterest/inspect-under-raking-light-for-chips-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/27/inspect-under-raking-light-for-chips-glass-sanding/cards/pinterest/inspect-under-raking-light-for-chips-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/27/inspect-under-raking-light-for-chips-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/inspect-under-raking-light-for-chips-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/27/inspect-under-raking-light-for-chips-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/inspect-under-raking-light-for-chips-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/27/inspect-under-raking-light-for-chips-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/inspect-under-raking-light-for-chips-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Edge Control To Avoid Rounding Details</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/26/edge-control-to-avoid-rounding-details-epoxy-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/26/edge-control-to-avoid-rounding-details-epoxy-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 15:40:56 +0000</pubDate><category>Plastic &amp; Epoxy Sanding</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-400</category><category>dry sanding</category><category>sanding block</category><description>Learn edge control techniques to avoid rounding details during epoxy sanding and woodworking, with tools, grits, and step-by-step methods for crisp lines.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="edge-control-mastery-epoxy-sanding-without-rounding"&gt;Edge Control Mastery: Epoxy Sanding Without Rounding&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Late Saturday light spills across your bench as you lift the piece you’ve been chasing all week—a cabinet door with beveled rails, a delicate reveal, and a flawless, glassy finish you poured your focus into. The surface glows. Then you see it: the profile at the lower edge has softened. It’s not ruined, but the shadow line that made the joinery look razor-clean has turned mushy. You didn’t gouge it or make a dramatic mistake; you just sanded. That’s the paradox. Sanding is supposed to refine, yet without edge control, it quietly erases what your hands and tools worked so hard to define. If your project includes epoxy sections or topcoats, epoxy sanding adds another layer of complexity—heat, clogging, and brittleness can conspire to round off details even faster.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/03.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/26/edge-control-to-avoid-rounding-details-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/edge-control-to-avoid-rounding-details-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/26/edge-control-to-avoid-rounding-details-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/edge-control-to-avoid-rounding-details-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/26/edge-control-to-avoid-rounding-details-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/edge-control-to-avoid-rounding-details-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/26/edge-control-to-avoid-rounding-details-epoxy-sanding/cards/instagram/edge-control-to-avoid-rounding-details-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/26/edge-control-to-avoid-rounding-details-epoxy-sanding/cards/instagram/edge-control-to-avoid-rounding-details-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/26/edge-control-to-avoid-rounding-details-epoxy-sanding/cards/instagram/edge-control-to-avoid-rounding-details-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/26/edge-control-to-avoid-rounding-details-epoxy-sanding/cards/pinterest/edge-control-to-avoid-rounding-details-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/26/edge-control-to-avoid-rounding-details-epoxy-sanding/cards/pinterest/edge-control-to-avoid-rounding-details-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/26/edge-control-to-avoid-rounding-details-epoxy-sanding/cards/pinterest/edge-control-to-avoid-rounding-details-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/26/edge-control-to-avoid-rounding-details-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/edge-control-to-avoid-rounding-details-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/26/edge-control-to-avoid-rounding-details-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/edge-control-to-avoid-rounding-details-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/26/edge-control-to-avoid-rounding-details-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/edge-control-to-avoid-rounding-details-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Squeegee Check To Read Leveling Progress</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/25/squeegee-check-to-read-leveling-progress-wet-dry-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/25/squeegee-check-to-read-leveling-progress-wet-dry-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 14:20:34 +0000</pubDate><category>Waterproof &amp; Wet/Dry Paper</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>dry sanding</category><category>sanding block</category><description>Engineer’s guide to squeegee checks and wet dry sandpaper for reading leveling, choosing abrasives, and avoiding defects in automotive and epoxy finishes.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="master-squeegee-checks-with-wet-dry-sandpaper"&gt;Master squeegee checks with wet dry sandpaper&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning, garage door up, the fender you sprayed last night looks flawless—until you bring it into raking light. The orange-peel you thought you’d erased is still there, just softened by gloss and optimism. You fill a spray bottle, tear off a square of waterproof abrasive, and start working methodically. A few strokes in, the pad feels consistent—no sudden grab, no chatter—just a soft, damp hiss. You pause, reach for a silicone squeegee, and draw a single pass across the panel. The water evacuates, leaving a thin, revealing film. High spots flash glossy first, low spots stay matte. The map of your progress appears in an instant.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/28.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/25/squeegee-check-to-read-leveling-progress-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/squeegee-check-to-read-leveling-progress-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/25/squeegee-check-to-read-leveling-progress-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/squeegee-check-to-read-leveling-progress-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/25/squeegee-check-to-read-leveling-progress-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/squeegee-check-to-read-leveling-progress-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/25/squeegee-check-to-read-leveling-progress-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/instagram/squeegee-check-to-read-leveling-progress-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/25/squeegee-check-to-read-leveling-progress-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/instagram/squeegee-check-to-read-leveling-progress-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/25/squeegee-check-to-read-leveling-progress-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/instagram/squeegee-check-to-read-leveling-progress-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/25/squeegee-check-to-read-leveling-progress-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/squeegee-check-to-read-leveling-progress-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/25/squeegee-check-to-read-leveling-progress-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/squeegee-check-to-read-leveling-progress-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/25/squeegee-check-to-read-leveling-progress-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/squeegee-check-to-read-leveling-progress-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/25/squeegee-check-to-read-leveling-progress-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/squeegee-check-to-read-leveling-progress-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/25/squeegee-check-to-read-leveling-progress-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/squeegee-check-to-read-leveling-progress-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/25/squeegee-check-to-read-leveling-progress-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/squeegee-check-to-read-leveling-progress-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>13</readingTime></item><item><title>Block Sanding Tips For Woodworking</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/19/block-sanding-tips-for-woodworking-sanding-block/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/19/block-sanding-tips-for-woodworking-sanding-block/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 14:49:53 +0000</pubDate><category>Sanding Blocks</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-220</category><category>sanding block</category><category>dust control</category><category>grit progression</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>Master block sanding with the right sanding block, grit, and technique.

&lt;p&gt;Saturday sunlight cuts through the garage dust as you run a hand along the tabletop you’ve been building for weeks. It’s close—close enough that friends would call it done—but your fingertips still catch where the light catches: faint ripples, a couple of low spots, swirl ghosts you can’t quite ignore. You try another pass with a random-orbit sander and the same thing happens—some areas look better, others worse. It feels like a conversation where you keep talking past the point, never quite saying what you mean. Then you reach for a simple tool that promises a steadier answer: a sanding block.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/08.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/19/block-sanding-tips-for-woodworking-sanding-block/cards/facebook/block-sanding-tips-for-woodworking-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/19/block-sanding-tips-for-woodworking-sanding-block/cards/facebook/block-sanding-tips-for-woodworking-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/19/block-sanding-tips-for-woodworking-sanding-block/cards/facebook/block-sanding-tips-for-woodworking-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/19/block-sanding-tips-for-woodworking-sanding-block/cards/instagram/block-sanding-tips-for-woodworking-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/19/block-sanding-tips-for-woodworking-sanding-block/cards/instagram/block-sanding-tips-for-woodworking-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/19/block-sanding-tips-for-woodworking-sanding-block/cards/instagram/block-sanding-tips-for-woodworking-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/19/block-sanding-tips-for-woodworking-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/block-sanding-tips-for-woodworking-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/19/block-sanding-tips-for-woodworking-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/block-sanding-tips-for-woodworking-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/19/block-sanding-tips-for-woodworking-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/block-sanding-tips-for-woodworking-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/19/block-sanding-tips-for-woodworking-sanding-block/cards/facebook/block-sanding-tips-for-woodworking-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/19/block-sanding-tips-for-woodworking-sanding-block/cards/facebook/block-sanding-tips-for-woodworking-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/19/block-sanding-tips-for-woodworking-sanding-block/cards/facebook/block-sanding-tips-for-woodworking-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Clean And Degrease Surfaces Before Sanding And Priming</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/17/clean-and-degrease-surfaces-before-sanding-and-priming-surface-preparation/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/17/clean-and-degrease-surfaces-before-sanding-and-priming-surface-preparation/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jan 2026 13:34:08 +0000</pubDate><category>Paint Removal &amp; Surface Prep</category><category>paint prep</category><category>rust removal</category><category>primer coat</category><category>sanding block</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><description>Clean, degrease, then sand and prime like a pro.

&lt;p&gt;Saturday mornings in my shop start the same way: coffee steaming on the bench, drop cloths folded like fresh sails, and that itch to make something look and feel right. I’ve seen perfect paint jobs fail on day two because the prep was rushed. I’ve also watched tired cabinets come back to life simply because we took cleaning seriously. That’s the unglamorous truth of surface preparation: it separates the projects you brag about from the ones you avoid eye contact with.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/27.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/17/clean-and-degrease-surfaces-before-sanding-and-priming-surface-preparation/cards/facebook/clean-and-degrease-surfaces-before-sanding-and-priming-surface-preparation.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/17/clean-and-degrease-surfaces-before-sanding-and-priming-surface-preparation/cards/facebook/clean-and-degrease-surfaces-before-sanding-and-priming-surface-preparation.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/17/clean-and-degrease-surfaces-before-sanding-and-priming-surface-preparation/cards/facebook/clean-and-degrease-surfaces-before-sanding-and-priming-surface-preparation.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/17/clean-and-degrease-surfaces-before-sanding-and-priming-surface-preparation/cards/instagram/clean-and-degrease-surfaces-before-sanding-and-priming-surface-preparation.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/17/clean-and-degrease-surfaces-before-sanding-and-priming-surface-preparation/cards/instagram/clean-and-degrease-surfaces-before-sanding-and-priming-surface-preparation.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/17/clean-and-degrease-surfaces-before-sanding-and-priming-surface-preparation/cards/instagram/clean-and-degrease-surfaces-before-sanding-and-priming-surface-preparation.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/17/clean-and-degrease-surfaces-before-sanding-and-priming-surface-preparation/cards/pinterest/clean-and-degrease-surfaces-before-sanding-and-priming-surface-preparation.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/17/clean-and-degrease-surfaces-before-sanding-and-priming-surface-preparation/cards/pinterest/clean-and-degrease-surfaces-before-sanding-and-priming-surface-preparation.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/17/clean-and-degrease-surfaces-before-sanding-and-priming-surface-preparation/cards/pinterest/clean-and-degrease-surfaces-before-sanding-and-priming-surface-preparation.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/17/clean-and-degrease-surfaces-before-sanding-and-priming-surface-preparation/cards/facebook/clean-and-degrease-surfaces-before-sanding-and-priming-surface-preparation.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/17/clean-and-degrease-surfaces-before-sanding-and-priming-surface-preparation/cards/facebook/clean-and-degrease-surfaces-before-sanding-and-priming-surface-preparation.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/17/clean-and-degrease-surfaces-before-sanding-and-priming-surface-preparation/cards/facebook/clean-and-degrease-surfaces-before-sanding-and-priming-surface-preparation.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>How To Feather Edge Old Paint Without Visible Steps</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/15/how-to-feather-edge-old-paint-without-visible-steps-auto-body-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/15/how-to-feather-edge-old-paint-without-visible-steps-auto-body-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 13:46:07 +0000</pubDate><category>Auto Body Sanding</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit progression</category><category>sanding block</category><category>dust control</category><description>Learn feather edging without steps.

&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning, the garage is cool and quiet except for the soft hiss of the compressor winding down and the rattle of a block sander in my hand. The old pickup in front of me has stories baked into every panel—sun-faded lacquer, a few driveway dings, and a repair line from years ago that catches the light like a ridge on a map. If you’ve ever repainted a panel only to see a ghost ring around your repair, you know the sting. You steal a glance sideways under the shop light and there it is—the “step.” That’s the moment when real craftsmanship starts. The difference between an amateur patch and a pro-level finish often comes down to feather edging: the controlled, patient art of tapering layers of old paint so the transition becomes invisible. This is the heart of auto body sanding—hands, eyes, and feel coming together—where you earn that invisible blend long before the spray gun ever leaves the rack.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/19.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/15/how-to-feather-edge-old-paint-without-visible-steps-auto-body-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-feather-edge-old-paint-without-visible-steps-auto-body-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/15/how-to-feather-edge-old-paint-without-visible-steps-auto-body-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-feather-edge-old-paint-without-visible-steps-auto-body-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/15/how-to-feather-edge-old-paint-without-visible-steps-auto-body-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-feather-edge-old-paint-without-visible-steps-auto-body-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/15/how-to-feather-edge-old-paint-without-visible-steps-auto-body-sanding/cards/instagram/how-to-feather-edge-old-paint-without-visible-steps-auto-body-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/15/how-to-feather-edge-old-paint-without-visible-steps-auto-body-sanding/cards/instagram/how-to-feather-edge-old-paint-without-visible-steps-auto-body-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/15/how-to-feather-edge-old-paint-without-visible-steps-auto-body-sanding/cards/instagram/how-to-feather-edge-old-paint-without-visible-steps-auto-body-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/15/how-to-feather-edge-old-paint-without-visible-steps-auto-body-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-to-feather-edge-old-paint-without-visible-steps-auto-body-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/15/how-to-feather-edge-old-paint-without-visible-steps-auto-body-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-to-feather-edge-old-paint-without-visible-steps-auto-body-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/15/how-to-feather-edge-old-paint-without-visible-steps-auto-body-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-to-feather-edge-old-paint-without-visible-steps-auto-body-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/15/how-to-feather-edge-old-paint-without-visible-steps-auto-body-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-feather-edge-old-paint-without-visible-steps-auto-body-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/15/how-to-feather-edge-old-paint-without-visible-steps-auto-body-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-feather-edge-old-paint-without-visible-steps-auto-body-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/15/how-to-feather-edge-old-paint-without-visible-steps-auto-body-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-feather-edge-old-paint-without-visible-steps-auto-body-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Best Grit For Sanding Joint Compound Seams</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/13/best-grit-for-sanding-joint-compound-seams-joint-compound-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/13/best-grit-for-sanding-joint-compound-seams-joint-compound-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 13:47:06 +0000</pubDate><category>Drywall Sanding</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>joint compound</category><category>dust control</category><category>sanding block</category><description>Pro guidance on grits, abrasives, and workflows for joint compound sanding so your drywall seams finish flat, fast, and paint-ready.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="best-grits-for-joint-compound-sanding-seams"&gt;Best Grits for Joint Compound Sanding Seams&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A winter morning, blinds cracked just enough to send a blade of light raking across a newly painted wall. You step closer. What looked perfect last night is now a relief map—slight ridges at the seams, a faint swirl near an inside corner, a shallow shadow where a butt joint telegraphs through. Every drywall finisher knows this moment. Light exposes the reality of surface prep. The good news: this is controllable. With the right abrasive progression and an efficient joint compound sanding workflow, you can make that same morning light your best QC tool, not your enemy.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/15.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/13/best-grit-for-sanding-joint-compound-seams-joint-compound-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-for-sanding-joint-compound-seams-joint-compound-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/13/best-grit-for-sanding-joint-compound-seams-joint-compound-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-for-sanding-joint-compound-seams-joint-compound-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/13/best-grit-for-sanding-joint-compound-seams-joint-compound-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-for-sanding-joint-compound-seams-joint-compound-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/13/best-grit-for-sanding-joint-compound-seams-joint-compound-sanding/cards/instagram/best-grit-for-sanding-joint-compound-seams-joint-compound-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/13/best-grit-for-sanding-joint-compound-seams-joint-compound-sanding/cards/instagram/best-grit-for-sanding-joint-compound-seams-joint-compound-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/13/best-grit-for-sanding-joint-compound-seams-joint-compound-sanding/cards/instagram/best-grit-for-sanding-joint-compound-seams-joint-compound-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/13/best-grit-for-sanding-joint-compound-seams-joint-compound-sanding/cards/pinterest/best-grit-for-sanding-joint-compound-seams-joint-compound-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/13/best-grit-for-sanding-joint-compound-seams-joint-compound-sanding/cards/pinterest/best-grit-for-sanding-joint-compound-seams-joint-compound-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/13/best-grit-for-sanding-joint-compound-seams-joint-compound-sanding/cards/pinterest/best-grit-for-sanding-joint-compound-seams-joint-compound-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/13/best-grit-for-sanding-joint-compound-seams-joint-compound-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-for-sanding-joint-compound-seams-joint-compound-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/13/best-grit-for-sanding-joint-compound-seams-joint-compound-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-for-sanding-joint-compound-seams-joint-compound-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/13/best-grit-for-sanding-joint-compound-seams-joint-compound-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-for-sanding-joint-compound-seams-joint-compound-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Sanding Techniques For Curved And Detailed Molding</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/12/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/12/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 13:48:46 +0000</pubDate><category>Trim &amp; Molding Sanding</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>clear coat</category><category>orbital sander</category><category>sanding block</category><description>Learn expert molding sanding techniques for curved and detailed trim.

&lt;p&gt;The afternoon light hit the hallway just right—the kind of slant that makes crisp edges glow and tiny flaws stand out like little shadows. The old crown molding you’d decided to keep (and just refresh) looked less romantic up close: nicks where movers grazed it, soft ridges from past paint jobs, and a few dips where a power sander had been a touch too enthusiastic. You ran a fingertip along the ogee, felt a wave where a clean curve should be, and realized this was not a job for brute force. It was a job for patience and precision. If you’ve tried molding sanding before, you know the paradox: the more you try to fix a profile, the easier it is to flatten it.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/13.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/12/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding/cards/facebook/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/12/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding/cards/facebook/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/12/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding/cards/facebook/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/12/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding/cards/instagram/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/12/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding/cards/instagram/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/12/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding/cards/instagram/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/12/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding/cards/pinterest/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/12/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding/cards/pinterest/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/12/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding/cards/pinterest/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/12/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding/cards/facebook/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/12/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding/cards/facebook/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/12/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding/cards/facebook/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Fix Dents And White Rings Before Applying New Finish</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 15:12:04 +0000</pubDate><category>Furniture Refinishing</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>sanding block</category><category>clear coat</category><category>dust control</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Learn how to fix dents and white rings before applying a new finish.

&lt;p&gt;Saturday light hits the dining table just right, and that’s both a blessing and a curse. You can see everything: the tiny crater where a laptop corner sank into soft oak during a late-night email sprint, the ghostly white ring from a forgotten coffee mug, the faint scratch where a science project met an impatient sponge. These are the little scars of a life well-lived—until you decide it’s time to refinish. As a workshop guy who lives for clean joins, crisp edges, and silky finishes, I’ve learned that great furniture restoration lives or dies before you ever open a finish can. If you don’t fix dents and lift white rings properly, your “new finish” just spotlights old mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/11.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration/cards/facebook/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration/cards/facebook/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration/cards/facebook/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration/cards/instagram/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration/cards/instagram/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration/cards/instagram/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration/cards/pinterest/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration/cards/pinterest/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration/cards/pinterest/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration/cards/facebook/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration/cards/facebook/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration/cards/facebook/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Identify Grain Direction Before Sanding Surfaces</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/identify-grain-direction-before-sanding-surfaces-grain-preparation/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/identify-grain-direction-before-sanding-surfaces-grain-preparation/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 13:36:01 +0000</pubDate><category>Wood sanding</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>sanding block</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Learn grain preparation: practical tests to read grain direction before sanding, abrasive science that prevents scratches, and steps for flawless finishes.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="grain-preparation-how-to-read-wood-before-sanding"&gt;Grain Preparation: How to Read Wood Before Sanding&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few Saturdays ago, I stood in the morning light with a walnut tabletop that had the right dimensions and the wrong look. Sun traced across the surface at a shallow angle, revealing every swirl left by a rushed sanding job the night before. I’d worked through my grits, vacuumed diligently, and still the surface read like a topographical map of mistakes. What changed the next pass wasn’t a fancier sander or a new finish—it was slowing down to read the wood first. Grain preparation sounds mundane, but it’s the difference between fighting a board and letting it finish itself. When you know which way the fibers lie, where they reverse, and how earlywood and latewood will respond, you save hours and achieve a surface that looks polished even before the first coat.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/09.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/identify-grain-direction-before-sanding-surfaces-grain-preparation/cards/facebook/identify-grain-direction-before-sanding-surfaces-grain-preparation.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/identify-grain-direction-before-sanding-surfaces-grain-preparation/cards/facebook/identify-grain-direction-before-sanding-surfaces-grain-preparation.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/identify-grain-direction-before-sanding-surfaces-grain-preparation/cards/facebook/identify-grain-direction-before-sanding-surfaces-grain-preparation.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/identify-grain-direction-before-sanding-surfaces-grain-preparation/cards/instagram/identify-grain-direction-before-sanding-surfaces-grain-preparation.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/identify-grain-direction-before-sanding-surfaces-grain-preparation/cards/instagram/identify-grain-direction-before-sanding-surfaces-grain-preparation.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/identify-grain-direction-before-sanding-surfaces-grain-preparation/cards/instagram/identify-grain-direction-before-sanding-surfaces-grain-preparation.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/identify-grain-direction-before-sanding-surfaces-grain-preparation/cards/pinterest/identify-grain-direction-before-sanding-surfaces-grain-preparation.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/identify-grain-direction-before-sanding-surfaces-grain-preparation/cards/pinterest/identify-grain-direction-before-sanding-surfaces-grain-preparation.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/identify-grain-direction-before-sanding-surfaces-grain-preparation/cards/pinterest/identify-grain-direction-before-sanding-surfaces-grain-preparation.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/identify-grain-direction-before-sanding-surfaces-grain-preparation/cards/facebook/identify-grain-direction-before-sanding-surfaces-grain-preparation.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/identify-grain-direction-before-sanding-surfaces-grain-preparation/cards/facebook/identify-grain-direction-before-sanding-surfaces-grain-preparation.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/identify-grain-direction-before-sanding-surfaces-grain-preparation/cards/facebook/identify-grain-direction-before-sanding-surfaces-grain-preparation.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Block Or Bare Hand — When To Use Each Method</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/10/block-or-bare-hand-when-to-use-each-method-hand-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/10/block-or-bare-hand-when-to-use-each-method-hand-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 13:34:24 +0000</pubDate><category>Hand Sanding Techniques</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>sanding block</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>Learn when to choose hand sanding or a sanding block for flat, curved, and detailed surfaces—plus techniques, grits, and tips for flawless results.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="hand-sanding-vs-block-when-each-method-wins"&gt;Hand sanding vs block: when each method wins&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quiet rhythm of sanding is one of the most honest sounds in making. Picture a Saturday afternoon: sunlight across the bench, a project that matters—maybe the oak table your family eats at, a guitar body you’ve been shaping for months, or a door panel you’re finally prepping for paint. You feel the surface more than you see it. The paper whispers over high spots, snags a little on a nick you missed. Instinct nudges the next move—do you keep the tactile connection of hand sanding, or pick up the block to force the surface true?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/05.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/10/block-or-bare-hand-when-to-use-each-method-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/block-or-bare-hand-when-to-use-each-method-hand-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/10/block-or-bare-hand-when-to-use-each-method-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/block-or-bare-hand-when-to-use-each-method-hand-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/10/block-or-bare-hand-when-to-use-each-method-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/block-or-bare-hand-when-to-use-each-method-hand-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/10/block-or-bare-hand-when-to-use-each-method-hand-sanding/cards/instagram/block-or-bare-hand-when-to-use-each-method-hand-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/10/block-or-bare-hand-when-to-use-each-method-hand-sanding/cards/instagram/block-or-bare-hand-when-to-use-each-method-hand-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/10/block-or-bare-hand-when-to-use-each-method-hand-sanding/cards/instagram/block-or-bare-hand-when-to-use-each-method-hand-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/10/block-or-bare-hand-when-to-use-each-method-hand-sanding/cards/pinterest/block-or-bare-hand-when-to-use-each-method-hand-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/10/block-or-bare-hand-when-to-use-each-method-hand-sanding/cards/pinterest/block-or-bare-hand-when-to-use-each-method-hand-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/10/block-or-bare-hand-when-to-use-each-method-hand-sanding/cards/pinterest/block-or-bare-hand-when-to-use-each-method-hand-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/10/block-or-bare-hand-when-to-use-each-method-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/block-or-bare-hand-when-to-use-each-method-hand-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/10/block-or-bare-hand-when-to-use-each-method-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/block-or-bare-hand-when-to-use-each-method-hand-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/10/block-or-bare-hand-when-to-use-each-method-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/block-or-bare-hand-when-to-use-each-method-hand-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Wet Sanding Plastics To Control Dust</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 15:17:50 +0000</pubDate><category>Plastic &amp; Epoxy Sanding</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-280</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>dust control</category><category>dry sanding</category><category>orbital sander</category><category>sanding block</category><description>Wet-sand plastics without the mess.

&lt;p&gt;You know that moment when you pick up a 3D‑printed part or an acrylic panel and see the tiny ridges, support nubs, and swirl marks catching the light? That’s when I head to the sink or a tray and set up for wet sanding. I’ve spent years making surfaces behave—wood, composites, plastics—and here’s the truth: wet sanding plastics is the calm, controlled path to a finish you can sign your name to. And the best tricks I learned polishing resin pours and doing epoxy sanding apply beautifully here—steady pressure, smart grit climbs, and keeping abrasives clean so they cut instead of smear.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/16.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding/cards/instagram/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding/cards/instagram/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding/cards/instagram/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding/cards/pinterest/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding/cards/pinterest/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding/cards/pinterest/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Cross Sanding Method For Leveling Panels</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 15:55:05 +0000</pubDate><category>Sanding Blocks</category><category>grit-240</category><category>sanding block</category><category>clear coat</category><category>orbital sander</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Learn the cross sanding method for leveling panels.

&lt;p&gt;The first time you chase “flat” across a panel, it sneaks up on you. Early morning, bench light low and raking, coffee cooling by the vise. You sight across a tabletop you’ve glued up—a handsome mix of maple and walnut—certain you nailed the clamps this time. But you feel it before you see it: the slightest rise where two boards meet, a shallow dish near one corner that catches the light like a ripple on a still pond. It’s not bad, but it’s enough to make a finish telegraph every imperfection. You could reach for a random orbital and it would eventually get you there, but it’s like mowing a lawn in circles. There’s a faster, more controlled way to true a surface: cross sanding with a sanding block.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/21.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block/cards/facebook/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block/cards/facebook/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block/cards/facebook/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block/cards/instagram/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block/cards/instagram/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block/cards/instagram/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block/cards/facebook/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block/cards/facebook/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block/cards/facebook/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>How To Sand Old Paint Without Gouging The Substrate</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/28/how-to-sand-old-paint-without-gouging-the-substrate-paint-removal-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/28/how-to-sand-old-paint-without-gouging-the-substrate-paint-removal-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2025 13:35:01 +0000</pubDate><category>Paint Removal &amp; Surface Prep</category><category>paint prep</category><category>rust removal</category><category>primer coat</category><category>sanding block</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>dust control</category><description>Engineer-tested methods for paint removal sanding that strip coatings fast while protecting wood, plaster, fiberglass, and metal from gouges.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="paint-removal-sanding-without-substrate-damage"&gt;Paint Removal Sanding Without Substrate Damage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Saturday light came in low as I rolled the garage door open, coffee steaming on the bench and an old pine door leaning against a pair of horses. I’d painted it twice over the years and regretted both coats: drips along the panels, brush marks telegraphing in every direction, and an all-over chalkiness that made the hardware look fancier than the door deserved. I wanted a clean reset—bare wood, crisp edges, and a surface ready to take finish properly—but without the scars I’ve made in the past. If you’ve ever slipped with a sander and bitten into softwood or plaster, you know the sinking feeling. The goal this time: do the job with the precision of a machinist. For that, paint removal sanding would have to be deliberate, measurable, and controlled.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/11.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/28/how-to-sand-old-paint-without-gouging-the-substrate-paint-removal-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-old-paint-without-gouging-the-substrate-paint-removal-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/28/how-to-sand-old-paint-without-gouging-the-substrate-paint-removal-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-old-paint-without-gouging-the-substrate-paint-removal-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/28/how-to-sand-old-paint-without-gouging-the-substrate-paint-removal-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-old-paint-without-gouging-the-substrate-paint-removal-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/28/how-to-sand-old-paint-without-gouging-the-substrate-paint-removal-sanding/cards/instagram/how-to-sand-old-paint-without-gouging-the-substrate-paint-removal-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/28/how-to-sand-old-paint-without-gouging-the-substrate-paint-removal-sanding/cards/instagram/how-to-sand-old-paint-without-gouging-the-substrate-paint-removal-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/28/how-to-sand-old-paint-without-gouging-the-substrate-paint-removal-sanding/cards/instagram/how-to-sand-old-paint-without-gouging-the-substrate-paint-removal-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/28/how-to-sand-old-paint-without-gouging-the-substrate-paint-removal-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-to-sand-old-paint-without-gouging-the-substrate-paint-removal-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/28/how-to-sand-old-paint-without-gouging-the-substrate-paint-removal-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-to-sand-old-paint-without-gouging-the-substrate-paint-removal-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/28/how-to-sand-old-paint-without-gouging-the-substrate-paint-removal-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-to-sand-old-paint-without-gouging-the-substrate-paint-removal-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/28/how-to-sand-old-paint-without-gouging-the-substrate-paint-removal-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-old-paint-without-gouging-the-substrate-paint-removal-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/28/how-to-sand-old-paint-without-gouging-the-substrate-paint-removal-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-old-paint-without-gouging-the-substrate-paint-removal-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/28/how-to-sand-old-paint-without-gouging-the-substrate-paint-removal-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-old-paint-without-gouging-the-substrate-paint-removal-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>How To Scuff Sand Glossy Trim For Better Adhesion</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/23/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/23/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 14:56:24 +0000</pubDate><category>Trim &amp; Molding Sanding</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-360</category><category>grit-400</category><category>dust control</category><category>sanding block</category><description>Learn expert scuff-sanding techniques for glossy trim so paint sticks flawlessly.

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve ever run your fingers along a glossy window casing and thought, “There’s no way paint will stick to this,” you’re right—at least not for long without the right prep. I’ve walked into plenty of homes where a beautifully painted room is betrayed by peeling, nicked baseboards and door frames. The culprit is almost always the same: slippery, factory-smooth or oil-painted trim with zero mechanical bite. This is where trim sanding earns its keep. Done right, scuff sanding turns that slick plastic-like surface into a paint-friendly foundation that your primer and topcoat can lock onto.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/26.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/23/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/23/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/23/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/23/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding/cards/instagram/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/23/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding/cards/instagram/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/23/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding/cards/instagram/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/23/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/23/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/23/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/23/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/23/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/23/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>How To Keep Pressure Even During Hand Sanding</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/21/how-to-keep-pressure-even-during-hand-sanding-hand-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/21/how-to-keep-pressure-even-during-hand-sanding-hand-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 21 Dec 2025 13:33:29 +0000</pubDate><category>Hand Sanding Techniques</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-220</category><category>sanding block</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Learn how to keep pressure even during hand sanding with pro body mechanics, blocks, grit strategy, and checks for perfect flats and curves.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="even-pressure-mastery-in-hand-sanding"&gt;Even Pressure Mastery in Hand Sanding&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fresh sheet of paper crackles between your fingers as you kneel beside a project you’ve put your evenings into—a walnut coffee table top you milled by hand, or maybe a maple guitar body you’ve been carving between jobs. You tell yourself it’s “just sanding,” but you know better. One wrong move and a finger groove shows up under the finish. One heavy corner and the veneer starts to whisper thin. The difference between amateur and pro often shows up right here, during hand sanding, in the quiet, repetitive passes that bring wood to life.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/18.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/21/how-to-keep-pressure-even-during-hand-sanding-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-keep-pressure-even-during-hand-sanding-hand-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/21/how-to-keep-pressure-even-during-hand-sanding-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-keep-pressure-even-during-hand-sanding-hand-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/21/how-to-keep-pressure-even-during-hand-sanding-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-keep-pressure-even-during-hand-sanding-hand-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/21/how-to-keep-pressure-even-during-hand-sanding-hand-sanding/cards/instagram/how-to-keep-pressure-even-during-hand-sanding-hand-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/21/how-to-keep-pressure-even-during-hand-sanding-hand-sanding/cards/instagram/how-to-keep-pressure-even-during-hand-sanding-hand-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/21/how-to-keep-pressure-even-during-hand-sanding-hand-sanding/cards/instagram/how-to-keep-pressure-even-during-hand-sanding-hand-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/21/how-to-keep-pressure-even-during-hand-sanding-hand-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-to-keep-pressure-even-during-hand-sanding-hand-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/21/how-to-keep-pressure-even-during-hand-sanding-hand-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-to-keep-pressure-even-during-hand-sanding-hand-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/21/how-to-keep-pressure-even-during-hand-sanding-hand-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-to-keep-pressure-even-during-hand-sanding-hand-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/21/how-to-keep-pressure-even-during-hand-sanding-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-keep-pressure-even-during-hand-sanding-hand-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/21/how-to-keep-pressure-even-during-hand-sanding-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-keep-pressure-even-during-hand-sanding-hand-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/21/how-to-keep-pressure-even-during-hand-sanding-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-keep-pressure-even-during-hand-sanding-hand-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>13</readingTime></item><item><title>Anti Clog Design For Painted Surfaces</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/anti-clog-design-for-painted-surfaces-open-coat-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/anti-clog-design-for-painted-surfaces-open-coat-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 20 Dec 2025 13:33:05 +0000</pubDate><category>Backing Types &amp; Coatings</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>dry sanding</category><category>sanding block</category><description>Learn how open coat sandpaper and anti-clog coatings deliver smoother results on painted surfaces, with pro tips, gear choices, and troubleshooting.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="open-coat-sandpaper-for-painted-surfaces"&gt;Open Coat Sandpaper for Painted Surfaces&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The weekend starts with a small promise to yourself: fresh paint, clean lines, a room that feels lighter when you walk in. But before the color goes up, something else has to come down—old paint, a rough patch, a drippy corner where the brush ran heavy last time. You pull out a sheet of sandpaper and, for a few strokes, it feels right. Then the dust rolls into pills, the sheet clogs, the finish scratches, and you’re wondering why this simple prep step feels like a fight. If you’ve ever paused mid-sand to pick off gummy paint from your paper, you’ve already met the enemy. The fix doesn’t start with elbow grease; it starts with choosing the right abrasive. On painted surfaces, open coat sandpaper—often paired with an anti-clog “no-fill” layer—doesn’t just last longer; it changes the way the surface behaves while you work.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/12.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/anti-clog-design-for-painted-surfaces-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/anti-clog-design-for-painted-surfaces-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/anti-clog-design-for-painted-surfaces-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/anti-clog-design-for-painted-surfaces-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/anti-clog-design-for-painted-surfaces-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/anti-clog-design-for-painted-surfaces-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/anti-clog-design-for-painted-surfaces-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/instagram/anti-clog-design-for-painted-surfaces-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/anti-clog-design-for-painted-surfaces-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/instagram/anti-clog-design-for-painted-surfaces-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/anti-clog-design-for-painted-surfaces-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/instagram/anti-clog-design-for-painted-surfaces-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/anti-clog-design-for-painted-surfaces-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/anti-clog-design-for-painted-surfaces-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/anti-clog-design-for-painted-surfaces-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/anti-clog-design-for-painted-surfaces-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/anti-clog-design-for-painted-surfaces-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/anti-clog-design-for-painted-surfaces-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/anti-clog-design-for-painted-surfaces-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/anti-clog-design-for-painted-surfaces-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/anti-clog-design-for-painted-surfaces-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/anti-clog-design-for-painted-surfaces-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/anti-clog-design-for-painted-surfaces-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/anti-clog-design-for-painted-surfaces-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Avoid Edge Burn Through While Wet Sanding</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/16/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/16/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 14:26:25 +0000</pubDate><category>Waterproof &amp; Wet/Dry Paper</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>clear coat</category><category>mirror finish</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>sanding block</category><description>Learn how to avoid edge burn-through while wet sanding using wet dry sandpaper, smart pressure control, and safe techniques around panels and body lines.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="avoid-edge-burn-through-with-wet-dry-sandpaper"&gt;Avoid Edge Burn-Through with Wet Dry Sandpaper&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday light pools across the driveway. Your project—clear coat mottled with orange peel and a few dust nibs—waits patiently. You’ve gathered your bucket, a soft block, and a stack of wet dry sandpaper sheets, promising yourself you’ll go slow and do it right this time. The first passes are almost meditative: water beads, slurry darkens, and the surface gradually evens out. Then, edging along a fender crease, your heart stutters—you feel it grab. One careless swipe, one ounce too much pressure, and suddenly the gloss gives way to dull haze. You squeegee and look closer. A whisper of primer peeks through at the ridge.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/25.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/16/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/16/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/16/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/16/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/instagram/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/16/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/instagram/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/16/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/instagram/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/16/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/16/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/16/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/16/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/16/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/16/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Sand Edges Straight With Block Control</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 11 Dec 2025 13:45:02 +0000</pubDate><category>Sanding Blocks</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-280</category><category>sanding block</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Engineer-tested methods to sand edges straight with block control—covering block materials, grits, pressure, and measurement for crisp, furniture-grade results.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="straight-edges-with-a-sanding-block-engineers-guide"&gt;Straight Edges with a Sanding Block: Engineer’s Guide&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a quiet satisfaction when a board’s edge goes from ragged to crisp under your fingertips. You sight down the length, catch a glint of shop light, and see a clean, uninterrupted line—no ripples, no dips, no proud corners snagging a cloth. That straightness is the difference between a door that closes like a whisper and one that bites the jamb. It’s the moment where craft meets physics, and for me—an engineer who lives for process—the right tool is what makes that moment repeatable. For edge work, that tool is a sanding block.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/05.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block/cards/facebook/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block/cards/facebook/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block/cards/facebook/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block/cards/instagram/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block/cards/instagram/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block/cards/instagram/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block/cards/facebook/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block/cards/facebook/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block/cards/facebook/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Use Light Pressure To Prevent Gouging</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/use-light-pressure-to-prevent-gouging-detail-sander-sheets/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/use-light-pressure-to-prevent-gouging-detail-sander-sheets/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 10 Dec 2025 16:10:27 +0000</pubDate><category>Detail Sander Sheets</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-280</category><category>grit progression</category><category>sanding block</category><description>Learn why light pressure prevents gouging and how to choose and use detail sander sheets for cleaner surfaces, longer abrasive life, and consistent finishes.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="why-detail-sander-sheets-require-a-light-touch"&gt;Why Detail Sander Sheets Require a Light Touch&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It starts with a hum—the compact orbit of a delta-pad gliding toward a tight inside corner where a cabinet door stile meets the rail. The walnut is older than your clamps, with grain that doesn’t forgive. You’ve prepped the shop, dialed down the RPM, and set up extraction, but your fingers still tense as you aim the tip into a fillet. Press too hard, and you’ll carve a shallow dish that daylight will announce the moment a finish hits. If you’ve ever found yourself polishing out a crater that appears only under raking light, you know the culprit: load. The solution isn’t exotic; it’s discipline. Use light pressure to prevent gouging—especially when your abrasive is fresh and your tool is nimble. That’s where the right detail sander sheets make or break the outcome.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/03.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/use-light-pressure-to-prevent-gouging-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/use-light-pressure-to-prevent-gouging-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/use-light-pressure-to-prevent-gouging-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/use-light-pressure-to-prevent-gouging-detail-sander-sheets.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/use-light-pressure-to-prevent-gouging-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/use-light-pressure-to-prevent-gouging-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/use-light-pressure-to-prevent-gouging-detail-sander-sheets/cards/instagram/use-light-pressure-to-prevent-gouging-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/use-light-pressure-to-prevent-gouging-detail-sander-sheets/cards/instagram/use-light-pressure-to-prevent-gouging-detail-sander-sheets.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/use-light-pressure-to-prevent-gouging-detail-sander-sheets/cards/instagram/use-light-pressure-to-prevent-gouging-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/use-light-pressure-to-prevent-gouging-detail-sander-sheets/cards/pinterest/use-light-pressure-to-prevent-gouging-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/use-light-pressure-to-prevent-gouging-detail-sander-sheets/cards/pinterest/use-light-pressure-to-prevent-gouging-detail-sander-sheets.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/use-light-pressure-to-prevent-gouging-detail-sander-sheets/cards/pinterest/use-light-pressure-to-prevent-gouging-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/use-light-pressure-to-prevent-gouging-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/use-light-pressure-to-prevent-gouging-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/use-light-pressure-to-prevent-gouging-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/use-light-pressure-to-prevent-gouging-detail-sander-sheets.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/use-light-pressure-to-prevent-gouging-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/use-light-pressure-to-prevent-gouging-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Epa Rrp Containment Setup For Lead Paint Sanding</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 15:44:17 +0000</pubDate><category>Paint Removal &amp; Surface Prep</category><category>paint prep</category><category>rust removal</category><category>primer coat</category><category>sanding block</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><description>A technical guide to EPA RRP containment for lead-safe sanding, covering surface prep, abrasive selection, HEPA capture, and low-dust workflows.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="epa-rrp-containment-for-lead-safe-sanding"&gt;EPA RRP Containment for Lead-Safe Sanding&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a moment, right before the sander touches the surface, when a room holds its breath. You’ve taped the vents, rolled up area rugs, shuffled furniture to the hallway. In an older home—maybe one built just after the war, with trim thick enough to show paint strata like tree rings—you feel the weight of history in the baseboards and widow’s walk. You also feel responsibility. Dust is memory made airborne, and when that dust contains lead, it crosses the boundary from nuisance to long-term health hazard in seconds. The job becomes less about “cleaning up later” and more about “controlling everything now.” That’s precisely where epa rrp containment setup lives, and it’s the fulcrum between craftsmanship and care.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/24.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding/cards/facebook/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding/cards/facebook/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding/cards/facebook/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding/cards/instagram/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding/cards/instagram/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding/cards/instagram/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding/cards/pinterest/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding/cards/pinterest/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding/cards/pinterest/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding/cards/facebook/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding/cards/facebook/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding/cards/facebook/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Edge Sanding Sequence To Match The Drum Sander Scratch</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/edge-sanding-sequence-to-match-the-drum-sander-scratch-edger-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/edge-sanding-sequence-to-match-the-drum-sander-scratch-edger-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 07 Dec 2025 18:13:47 +0000</pubDate><category>Floor &amp; Deck Sanding</category><category>grit-40</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit progression</category><category>sanding block</category><description>Learn a precise edger sanding sequence to blend edges with drum sander scratches and eliminate halos, swirls, and mismatched textures on hardwood floors.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="edger-sanding-sequence-to-match-drum-scratches"&gt;Edger sanding sequence to match drum scratches&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The afternoon light slid across your living room, catching the raw promise of bare wood. You’d pulled the last nail out, rented the big-machine sander, and felt that satisfying hum as years of finish lifted away in long, clean passes. The field of the floor looked even—linear, disciplined, almost new. Then your eyes drifted to the perimeter, that six to twelve inches along the baseboards where the drum could never reach. There, the grain looked different. A shadowy ring—soft at first—seemed to appear, like a halo you couldn’t unsee.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/14.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/edge-sanding-sequence-to-match-the-drum-sander-scratch-edger-sanding/cards/facebook/edge-sanding-sequence-to-match-the-drum-sander-scratch-edger-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/edge-sanding-sequence-to-match-the-drum-sander-scratch-edger-sanding/cards/facebook/edge-sanding-sequence-to-match-the-drum-sander-scratch-edger-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/edge-sanding-sequence-to-match-the-drum-sander-scratch-edger-sanding/cards/facebook/edge-sanding-sequence-to-match-the-drum-sander-scratch-edger-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/edge-sanding-sequence-to-match-the-drum-sander-scratch-edger-sanding/cards/instagram/edge-sanding-sequence-to-match-the-drum-sander-scratch-edger-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/edge-sanding-sequence-to-match-the-drum-sander-scratch-edger-sanding/cards/instagram/edge-sanding-sequence-to-match-the-drum-sander-scratch-edger-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/edge-sanding-sequence-to-match-the-drum-sander-scratch-edger-sanding/cards/instagram/edge-sanding-sequence-to-match-the-drum-sander-scratch-edger-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/edge-sanding-sequence-to-match-the-drum-sander-scratch-edger-sanding/cards/pinterest/edge-sanding-sequence-to-match-the-drum-sander-scratch-edger-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/edge-sanding-sequence-to-match-the-drum-sander-scratch-edger-sanding/cards/pinterest/edge-sanding-sequence-to-match-the-drum-sander-scratch-edger-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/edge-sanding-sequence-to-match-the-drum-sander-scratch-edger-sanding/cards/pinterest/edge-sanding-sequence-to-match-the-drum-sander-scratch-edger-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/edge-sanding-sequence-to-match-the-drum-sander-scratch-edger-sanding/cards/facebook/edge-sanding-sequence-to-match-the-drum-sander-scratch-edger-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/edge-sanding-sequence-to-match-the-drum-sander-scratch-edger-sanding/cards/facebook/edge-sanding-sequence-to-match-the-drum-sander-scratch-edger-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/edge-sanding-sequence-to-match-the-drum-sander-scratch-edger-sanding/cards/facebook/edge-sanding-sequence-to-match-the-drum-sander-scratch-edger-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Best Sanding Sponge Grit For Trim Surface Prep</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 07 Dec 2025 15:12:05 +0000</pubDate><category>Trim &amp; Molding Sanding</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-280</category><category>grit-320</category><category>dry sanding</category><category>sanding block</category><category>dust control</category><description>Engineer-tested guide to pick the best sponge for trim, from grit selection to technique, for flawless adhesion and smooth paint on wood and MDF.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="best-sponge-for-trim-sanding-grits-that-last"&gt;Best sponge for trim: sanding grits that last&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning light spilled across the hallway, revealing every chip and ridge along the baseboards that I’d stopped seeing months ago. The kind of small defects you only notice when you decide to fix them. I laid out the drop cloths and opened the can of trim enamel, mentally penciling in a half-day project. Then I reached for a sponge for trim instead of paper. That choice seems small, but it’s the difference between a paint job that looks good today and one that still looks good next year. As an engineer, I’ve learned that coatings fail at interfaces, not in the middle of the film. And the interface—the mechanical “tooth” you cut into the substrate—comes from your abrasives.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/10.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim/cards/facebook/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim/cards/facebook/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim/cards/facebook/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim/cards/instagram/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim/cards/instagram/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim/cards/instagram/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim/cards/pinterest/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim/cards/pinterest/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim/cards/pinterest/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim/cards/facebook/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim/cards/facebook/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim/cards/facebook/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>What Grit To Sand Furniture Before Applying Stain</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 07 Dec 2025 13:31:13 +0000</pubDate><category>Furniture Refinishing</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-800</category><category>orbital sander</category><category>sanding block</category><category>dust control</category><description>Learn the exact sanding grits, workflows, and checks that drive even stain color and professional results on furniture projects.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="stain-preparation-what-grit-to-sand-furniture"&gt;Stain Preparation: What Grit to Sand Furniture&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a quiet Saturday morning, you clear the dining table and pull the tarp tight. The surface is a patchwork of rings, scratches, and a few mystery stains from a previous life—nothing that an orbital sander and a little patience can’t fix. The smell of sawdust arrives quickly, and with it a deceptively simple choice: what grit to sand furniture before applying stain. There are plenty of opinions, but only one proper sequence for your species, stain type, and condition of the substrate. That decision—more than the brand of stain or even your brushing technique—will decide whether the grain pops evenly or blotches, whether the edges stay crisp or burn through, and whether your topcoat glides over a consistent scratch pattern or amplifies every swirl mark. Done right, stain preparation becomes a repeatable, almost meditative routine that pays off with reliable, beautiful finishes.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/08.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation/cards/facebook/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation/cards/facebook/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation/cards/facebook/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation/cards/instagram/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation/cards/instagram/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation/cards/instagram/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation/cards/pinterest/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation/cards/pinterest/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation/cards/pinterest/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation/cards/facebook/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation/cards/facebook/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation/cards/facebook/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Sponge Versus Paper On Curved Surfaces</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 15:39:58 +0000</pubDate><category>Sanding Sponges</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>grit progression</category><category>sanding block</category><category>dust control</category><description>Learn when a sanding sponge outperforms paper on curves.

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve ever stood in your garage at 9 p.m., holding a cup of coffee with one hand and a carved table leg with the other, you know the moment: the curve looks great until you touch it with the wrong abrasive. Flat spots appear, sharp lines soften, and suddenly the piece loses the crisp profile you loved. I’ve been there countless times—chair arms, bowl rims, crown molding returns—each one begging for finesse. The first time I switched from paper to a sanding sponge mid-project, it felt like I’d finally turned down the static and could hear the wood speaking again. The foam hugged the profile, didn’t dig in, and let me smooth without erasing detail.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/22.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge/cards/instagram/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge/cards/instagram/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge/cards/instagram/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge/cards/pinterest/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge/cards/pinterest/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge/cards/pinterest/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>13</readingTime></item><item><title>Wrap Sandpaper Correctly On A Block</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 14:51:04 +0000</pubDate><category>Sanding Blocks</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>sanding block</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>dry sanding</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Learn how to wrap sandpaper on a sanding block for flat, fast, scratch-free results.

&lt;p&gt;I still remember the first shelf I built for our entryway—a simple maple plank resting on two brackets, meant to hold keys and a couple of planters. The board came out of the planer with faint ripples; the chamfers were uneven; and the finish looked decent from six feet away but not when the morning light hit. I did what many DIYers do: grabbed a sheet of paper, wrapped it around a block haphazardly, and pushed until my fingers ached. The final surface was smooth-ish, but I had shallow waves and rounded corners that betrayed the lack of control. Only after I switched to a properly wrapped sanding block did the maple flatten, the scratch pattern tighten, and my edges stay crisp.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/20.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block/cards/facebook/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block/cards/facebook/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block/cards/facebook/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block/cards/instagram/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block/cards/instagram/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block/cards/instagram/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block/cards/facebook/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block/cards/facebook/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block/cards/facebook/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>13</readingTime></item><item><title>Avoid Rounding Edges During Detail Sanding</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/avoid-rounding-edges-during-detail-sanding-detail-sander-sheets/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/avoid-rounding-edges-during-detail-sanding-detail-sander-sheets/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 13:39:01 +0000</pubDate><category>Detail Sander Sheets</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>dust control</category><category>orbital sander</category><category>sanding block</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Keep edges crisp: pro techniques, sheet choices, and workflows to avoid rounding during detail sanding with precision abrasive control.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="how-to-avoid-rounding-edges-with-detail-sander-sheets"&gt;How to Avoid Rounding Edges with Detail Sander Sheets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A crisp edge is honesty you can feel. You run a fingertip along the rail of a cabinet door or the rim of a keepsake box and know immediately whether the prep was careful or hurried. The line should be true—straight, sharp, and confident—not washed out by a power sander that wobbled a hair too long at the corner. The irony is familiar: we reach for a small triangular sander to finesse tight spaces, then watch it soften what we wanted to preserve. If you’ve ever started a job with a fresh pack of detail sander sheets, only to end it with unintentionally eased profiles, this guide is for you.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/18.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/avoid-rounding-edges-during-detail-sanding-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/avoid-rounding-edges-during-detail-sanding-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/avoid-rounding-edges-during-detail-sanding-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/avoid-rounding-edges-during-detail-sanding-detail-sander-sheets.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/avoid-rounding-edges-during-detail-sanding-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/avoid-rounding-edges-during-detail-sanding-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/avoid-rounding-edges-during-detail-sanding-detail-sander-sheets/cards/instagram/avoid-rounding-edges-during-detail-sanding-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/avoid-rounding-edges-during-detail-sanding-detail-sander-sheets/cards/instagram/avoid-rounding-edges-during-detail-sanding-detail-sander-sheets.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/avoid-rounding-edges-during-detail-sanding-detail-sander-sheets/cards/instagram/avoid-rounding-edges-during-detail-sanding-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/avoid-rounding-edges-during-detail-sanding-detail-sander-sheets/cards/pinterest/avoid-rounding-edges-during-detail-sanding-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/avoid-rounding-edges-during-detail-sanding-detail-sander-sheets/cards/pinterest/avoid-rounding-edges-during-detail-sanding-detail-sander-sheets.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/avoid-rounding-edges-during-detail-sanding-detail-sander-sheets/cards/pinterest/avoid-rounding-edges-during-detail-sanding-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/avoid-rounding-edges-during-detail-sanding-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/avoid-rounding-edges-during-detail-sanding-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/avoid-rounding-edges-during-detail-sanding-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/avoid-rounding-edges-during-detail-sanding-detail-sander-sheets.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/avoid-rounding-edges-during-detail-sanding-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/avoid-rounding-edges-during-detail-sanding-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>When To Choose Chemical Stripping Instead Of Sanding</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 13:38:25 +0000</pubDate><category>Paint Removal &amp; Surface Prep</category><category>paint prep</category><category>rust removal</category><category>primer coat</category><category>sanding block</category><category>orbital sander</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Learn when chemical stripping beats sanding.

&lt;p&gt;You can hear a project before you see it: the whine of an orbital sander, the hiss of a dust extractor, the rasp of grit carving tracks in an old finish. The other soundtrack is a quiet shop, drop cloths taped down, a gelled stripper turning tired paint into ribbons under a plastic scraper. Both are valid approaches to surface preparation, and the results hinge on choosing the right path at the outset. The paint stripping vs sanding decision is less about preference and more about material science, coating behavior, and the downstream finish you expect. If you’re staring at a five-layer porch rail, a veneered dresser, or a fiberglass hatch, the fastest route to a clean, profile-ready surface may not be the one you think.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/10.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding/cards/instagram/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding/cards/instagram/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding/cards/instagram/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding/cards/pinterest/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding/cards/pinterest/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding/cards/pinterest/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Compare Scratch Depth At Equal Grits</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/compare-scratch-depth-at-equal-grits-abrasive-testing/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/compare-scratch-depth-at-equal-grits-abrasive-testing/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 21 Nov 2025 02:06:34 +0000</pubDate><category>Abrasive Innovation &amp; Testing</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-220</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>sanding block</category><description>Learn how to compare scratch depth at equal grits with practical abrasive testing, real workshop steps, and pro tips for wood, metal, and composites.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="abrasive-testing-compare-scratch-depth-at-equal-grits"&gt;Abrasive Testing: Compare Scratch Depth at Equal Grits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It starts the same way in every shop: coffee cooling on the bench, clamp marks still fresh on yesterday’s glue-up, and a stack of sandpaper cut into tidy quarters. You grab two sheets—both labeled 220 grit—because today you’re chasing a clean, consistent surface on a walnut tabletop that deserves better than swirl marks. Ten strokes in, the sheen looks different between sheets. You can feel it with your fingertips too—one side looks hazier, slightly more torn up, and the grain lines pop in a way that screams “deeper scratches.” Both sheets claim the same grit number, so why the mismatch? That’s the kind of moment that sends me down the rabbit hole of abrasive testing.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/19.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/compare-scratch-depth-at-equal-grits-abrasive-testing/cards/facebook/compare-scratch-depth-at-equal-grits-abrasive-testing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/compare-scratch-depth-at-equal-grits-abrasive-testing/cards/facebook/compare-scratch-depth-at-equal-grits-abrasive-testing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/compare-scratch-depth-at-equal-grits-abrasive-testing/cards/facebook/compare-scratch-depth-at-equal-grits-abrasive-testing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/compare-scratch-depth-at-equal-grits-abrasive-testing/cards/instagram/compare-scratch-depth-at-equal-grits-abrasive-testing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/compare-scratch-depth-at-equal-grits-abrasive-testing/cards/instagram/compare-scratch-depth-at-equal-grits-abrasive-testing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/compare-scratch-depth-at-equal-grits-abrasive-testing/cards/instagram/compare-scratch-depth-at-equal-grits-abrasive-testing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/compare-scratch-depth-at-equal-grits-abrasive-testing/cards/pinterest/compare-scratch-depth-at-equal-grits-abrasive-testing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/compare-scratch-depth-at-equal-grits-abrasive-testing/cards/pinterest/compare-scratch-depth-at-equal-grits-abrasive-testing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/compare-scratch-depth-at-equal-grits-abrasive-testing/cards/pinterest/compare-scratch-depth-at-equal-grits-abrasive-testing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/compare-scratch-depth-at-equal-grits-abrasive-testing/cards/facebook/compare-scratch-depth-at-equal-grits-abrasive-testing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/compare-scratch-depth-at-equal-grits-abrasive-testing/cards/facebook/compare-scratch-depth-at-equal-grits-abrasive-testing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/compare-scratch-depth-at-equal-grits-abrasive-testing/cards/facebook/compare-scratch-depth-at-equal-grits-abrasive-testing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Paper Weight And Flexibility Differences</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/paper-weight-and-flexibility-differences-open-coat-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/paper-weight-and-flexibility-differences-open-coat-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2025 05:56:56 +0000</pubDate><category>Backing Types &amp; Coatings</category><category>grit-150</category><category>orbital sander</category><category>sanding block</category><category>grit progression</category><category>wet sanding</category><description>Understand paper weight, flexibility, and when to use open coat sandpaper for cleaner cuts, fewer clogs, and pro-grade finishes in wood and metalwork.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="open-coat-sandpaper-paper-weight-and-flexibility"&gt;Open Coat Sandpaper, Paper Weight, and Flexibility&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning, mug of coffee steaming on the bench. The shop is still cool, and the only sound is your block plane sliding across a maple board. You’re smoothing a reclaimed slab into a dining table that has to look heirloom, not “weekend project.” You switch to abrasive work—this is where most projects are won or lost. Pull a sheet from the drawer and you can tell instantly: too stiff and it will flatten the gentle chamfer you’ve planed; too flimsy and it will telegraph every ridge from your fingertips. You also know the species: maple burns if you let a clogged sheet skate across it. That’s where choice matters—paper weight, flexibility, and whether open coat sandpaper will let the dust clear instead of loading the sheet like wet snow on a shovel.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/11.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/paper-weight-and-flexibility-differences-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/paper-weight-and-flexibility-differences-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/paper-weight-and-flexibility-differences-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/paper-weight-and-flexibility-differences-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/paper-weight-and-flexibility-differences-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/paper-weight-and-flexibility-differences-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/paper-weight-and-flexibility-differences-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/instagram/paper-weight-and-flexibility-differences-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/paper-weight-and-flexibility-differences-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/instagram/paper-weight-and-flexibility-differences-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/paper-weight-and-flexibility-differences-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/instagram/paper-weight-and-flexibility-differences-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/paper-weight-and-flexibility-differences-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/paper-weight-and-flexibility-differences-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/paper-weight-and-flexibility-differences-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/paper-weight-and-flexibility-differences-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/paper-weight-and-flexibility-differences-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/paper-weight-and-flexibility-differences-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/paper-weight-and-flexibility-differences-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/paper-weight-and-flexibility-differences-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/paper-weight-and-flexibility-differences-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/paper-weight-and-flexibility-differences-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/paper-weight-and-flexibility-differences-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/paper-weight-and-flexibility-differences-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Choose Pad And Compound For Plastics</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 13:37:22 +0000</pubDate><category>Resin Polishing</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>grit progression</category><category>sanding block</category><category>polishing pads</category><description>Engineer’s guide to resin polishing: pick the right pad and compound for acrylic, polycarbonate, and epoxy.

&lt;p&gt;On a quiet Saturday, I watched a friend slowly lower a buffing pad onto the cloudy edge of his epoxy river table. The coffee mugs had left fine scuffs; sunlight turned them into halos. He’d already tried an all-purpose metal polish and a “universal” wool pad—both grabbed hard, smeared the surface, and left the epoxy warmer than I liked. He looked at me and asked the question I hear weekly: “Which pad and which compound do I actually use for plastics?” It’s an honest question with costly consequences if you guess wrong. Unlike metal paint systems that tolerate a surprising amount of heat and pressure, plastics and cured resins can haze, smear, or stress-craze from a few seconds of the wrong contact.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/01.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/cards/instagram/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/cards/instagram/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/cards/instagram/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/cards/pinterest/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/cards/pinterest/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/cards/pinterest/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>13</readingTime></item><item><title>Flush Slurry To Prevent Loading</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/16/flush-slurry-to-prevent-loading-wet-dry-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/16/flush-slurry-to-prevent-loading-wet-dry-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 16 Nov 2025 15:10:09 +0000</pubDate><category>Waterproof &amp; Wet/Dry Paper</category><category>grit-280</category><category>clear coat</category><category>grit progression</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>sanding block</category><description>Learn how to flush slurry to prevent loading with wet dry sandpaper.

&lt;p&gt;The first time I noticed loading, I was hunched over a maple cutting board in a chilly garage, chasing a glass-smooth finish that never seemed to arrive. The sandpaper was supposed to be “the good stuff,” and I was stepping through the grits like a textbook. But after a few strokes, the sheet glazed over. Instead of cutting, it skated—leaving faint scorch marks and a haze of streaks. I swapped sheets, pressed harder, tried angles. Same story: the paper clogged, and the surface got warmer. That’s when the lightbulb went off. It wasn’t the grit. It wasn’t the wood. It was the slurry—swarf, resin, and water—hanging around and turning my abrasive into a slick.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/24.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/16/flush-slurry-to-prevent-loading-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/flush-slurry-to-prevent-loading-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/16/flush-slurry-to-prevent-loading-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/flush-slurry-to-prevent-loading-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/16/flush-slurry-to-prevent-loading-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/flush-slurry-to-prevent-loading-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/16/flush-slurry-to-prevent-loading-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/instagram/flush-slurry-to-prevent-loading-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/16/flush-slurry-to-prevent-loading-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/instagram/flush-slurry-to-prevent-loading-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/16/flush-slurry-to-prevent-loading-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/instagram/flush-slurry-to-prevent-loading-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/16/flush-slurry-to-prevent-loading-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/flush-slurry-to-prevent-loading-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/16/flush-slurry-to-prevent-loading-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/flush-slurry-to-prevent-loading-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/16/flush-slurry-to-prevent-loading-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/flush-slurry-to-prevent-loading-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/16/flush-slurry-to-prevent-loading-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/flush-slurry-to-prevent-loading-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/16/flush-slurry-to-prevent-loading-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/flush-slurry-to-prevent-loading-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/16/flush-slurry-to-prevent-loading-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/flush-slurry-to-prevent-loading-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Choose Cork Or Rubber Blocks For Even Pressure</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 16:32:32 +0000</pubDate><category>Sanding Blocks</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>sanding block</category><description>Decide between cork and rubber sanding block for even pressure.

&lt;p&gt;You feel it before you see it: the drag of abrasive across primer, the subtle chatter in your wrist, the way dust plumes differently at the edge than it does in the center. The project might be a cabinet door with raised panels, an automotive quarter panel wearing its first coat of high-build, or a mid-century tabletop with a veneer you refuse to risk. Regardless of the substrate, the instrument in your hand—a sanding block—is the difference between flat and faceted, between crisp and crowned. When the pressure is wrong, the finish is wrong. The telltale symptoms appear later: telegraphed low spots under gloss, rounded edges where a sharp reveal should live, swirl hazing that refuses to die at the next grit.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/04.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/cards/facebook/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/cards/facebook/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/cards/facebook/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/cards/instagram/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/cards/instagram/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/cards/instagram/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/cards/facebook/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/cards/facebook/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/cards/facebook/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>13</readingTime></item><item><title>Choose Wool Foam Or Microfiber Pads</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 16:03:08 +0000</pubDate><category>Polishing &amp; Finishing</category><category>mirror finish</category><category>polishing pads</category><category>grit progression</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-2500</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>clear coat</category><category>sanding block</category><description>Engineer-tested guide to choosing wool, foam, or microfiber pads—and when to pair them with polishing sandpaper—for faster, safer, glossier results.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-with-polishing-sandpaper"&gt;Wool, Foam, or Microfiber Pads with Polishing Sandpaper&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a quiet Saturday morning, you tape off the trim, load your polisher, and stare at the paint under bright LEDs. Swirls dance across the clear coat, with a few deeper scratches that refuse to disappear. You’ve got compounds lined up, pads sorted into neatly labeled bins, and sheets of polishing sandpaper ready if the defects demand leveling. Yet the question lingers: which pad material will get you there fastest, without overheating, over-thinning the clear, or leaving haze to chase?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/27.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper/cards/instagram/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper/cards/instagram/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper/cards/instagram/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Strip Failing Polyurethane Then Sand Residue Before Refinishing</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 13:37:09 +0000</pubDate><category>Paint Removal &amp; Surface Prep</category><category>paint prep</category><category>rust removal</category><category>primer coat</category><category>sanding block</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-1500</category><description>Learn expert steps for coating removal, sanding residue, and refinishing wood for durable, beautiful results with safe methods, tools, and pro tips.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="coating-removal-and-refinishing-failing-polyurethane"&gt;Coating Removal and Refinishing Failing Polyurethane&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning light spilled across the dining table you’ve hosted around for years. You set down a mug and notice the surface clings just a little; a ring remains, faint but stubborn. Along the edges, the once-smooth finish has turned brittle and chalky, tiny flakes catching the light like dust motes in motion. You run a fingertip across the spot where a placemat lives—glossy here, dull there, with a subtle ridge between. The finish is failing, and it’s happening faster than you’d like. You can feel the stakes: this is not just a table—it’s family dinners, late-night projects, first-day-of-school photos, and the clean expanse that makes a home feel ready.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/23.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal/cards/facebook/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal/cards/facebook/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal/cards/facebook/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal/cards/instagram/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal/cards/instagram/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal/cards/instagram/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal/cards/pinterest/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal/cards/pinterest/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal/cards/pinterest/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal/cards/facebook/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal/cards/facebook/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal/cards/facebook/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>How To Level Uneven Wood Panels By Sanding Only</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-level-uneven-wood-panels-by-sanding-only-surface-leveling/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-level-uneven-wood-panels-by-sanding-only-surface-leveling/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2025 14:29:42 +0000</pubDate><category>Wood sanding</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-500</category><category>sanding block</category><category>dust control</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Learn pro sanding techniques for surface leveling.

&lt;p&gt;On a cool Saturday morning, your glue-up looks perfect from three paces away. The seams are tight, the grain lines match, and you’re already picturing the finish. Then the raking light hits—tiny ridges, a clamp bump here, a cup there. You run a straightedge across and hear that hollow tick in the middle. No planer, no drum sander, and only the shop basics on your bench. This is where the craft begins, not where it ends. With deliberate handwork, smart tool choice, and disciplined grit progression, you can achieve precise surface leveling using sanding alone. The key is to treat the panel like a system: track where the highs are, remove stock only where you must, and lock in flatness before you chase scratches. If your project is an heirloom tabletop or a cabinet door set, your workflow doesn’t change much—what changes is your patience and how clearly you can “see” the surface as you sand. I’ll show you my repeatable process for flattening panels by hand, with nothing more than sandpaper, a few blocks, and a healthy respect for dust control and measurement. You’ll learn to read the wood, choose the right grit sequences, and avoid common traps like rolling edges or leaving a subtle dish that ruins your finish. This is hands-on, no-nonsense surface leveling tailored for real shops and real projects.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-level-uneven-wood-panels-by-sanding-only-surface-leveling/cards/facebook/how-to-level-uneven-wood-panels-by-sanding-only-surface-leveling.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-level-uneven-wood-panels-by-sanding-only-surface-leveling/cards/facebook/how-to-level-uneven-wood-panels-by-sanding-only-surface-leveling.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-level-uneven-wood-panels-by-sanding-only-surface-leveling/cards/facebook/how-to-level-uneven-wood-panels-by-sanding-only-surface-leveling.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-level-uneven-wood-panels-by-sanding-only-surface-leveling/cards/instagram/how-to-level-uneven-wood-panels-by-sanding-only-surface-leveling.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-level-uneven-wood-panels-by-sanding-only-surface-leveling/cards/instagram/how-to-level-uneven-wood-panels-by-sanding-only-surface-leveling.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-level-uneven-wood-panels-by-sanding-only-surface-leveling/cards/instagram/how-to-level-uneven-wood-panels-by-sanding-only-surface-leveling.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-level-uneven-wood-panels-by-sanding-only-surface-leveling/cards/pinterest/how-to-level-uneven-wood-panels-by-sanding-only-surface-leveling.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-level-uneven-wood-panels-by-sanding-only-surface-leveling/cards/pinterest/how-to-level-uneven-wood-panels-by-sanding-only-surface-leveling.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-level-uneven-wood-panels-by-sanding-only-surface-leveling/cards/pinterest/how-to-level-uneven-wood-panels-by-sanding-only-surface-leveling.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-level-uneven-wood-panels-by-sanding-only-surface-leveling/cards/facebook/how-to-level-uneven-wood-panels-by-sanding-only-surface-leveling.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-level-uneven-wood-panels-by-sanding-only-surface-leveling/cards/facebook/how-to-level-uneven-wood-panels-by-sanding-only-surface-leveling.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-level-uneven-wood-panels-by-sanding-only-surface-leveling/cards/facebook/how-to-level-uneven-wood-panels-by-sanding-only-surface-leveling.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>9</readingTime></item><item><title>Wet Sanding To Control Marine Dust</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 08 Nov 2025 00:54:10 +0000</pubDate><category>Marine Sanding</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>orbital sander</category><category>dry sanding</category><category>sanding block</category><category>mirror finish</category><description>Learn wet boat sanding to cut toxic dust, protect waterways, and prep your hull right.

&lt;p&gt;There’s a particular quiet to the yard before sunrise. The halyards ping, the coffee steams in a chipped thermos, and the hull you’ve been avoiding stands there like a promise you can’t put off. I’ve been on both sides of that moment—rushing, dusty, and regretting shortcuts later—and the method that changed the game for me was wet boat sanding. Not because it’s pretty, but because it’s efficient, safer for your lungs, and easier to keep the neighbors and the yard manager happy. You control the mess. You protect the water you love. And you end the day with a hull that’s flatter, cooler, and ready to bond.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding/cards/instagram/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding/cards/instagram/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding/cards/instagram/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding/cards/pinterest/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding/cards/pinterest/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding/cards/pinterest/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Soap To Water Ratio For Lubrication</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 07 Nov 2025 14:24:10 +0000</pubDate><category>Waterproof &amp; Wet/Dry Paper</category><category>grit-360</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-1200</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-2500</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>sanding block</category><description>Engineer-tested soap-to-water ratios for lubricating wet dry sandpaper on paint, wood, and metal.

&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning, a quiet garage, and a project you’ve promised yourself you’d finally finish. The headlight lenses are foggy. The table top has those telltale dust nibs in the polyurethane. A chef’s knife hangs dull on the magnetic strip, begging for bite. You fill a bucket, reach for a bottle of soap, and lay out sheets of wet dry sandpaper—ready to get to work. And then you pause. How much soap should actually go into the water? One drop? A teaspoon? More? You’ve heard “soapy water helps it glide,” but glide isn’t the only variable that matters. There’s also bite, swarf transport, scratch control, and heat. The soap-to-water ratio dictates whether you refine fast and clean—or skate on a film that kills cutting speed and blurs feedback.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/instagram/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/instagram/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/instagram/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Choose Hose Diameter For Best Suction</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 06 Nov 2025 14:24:00 +0000</pubDate><category>Dust Extraction Systems</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>dry sanding</category><category>orbital sander</category><category>sanding block</category><category>joint compound</category><description>An engineer’s guide to hose diameter for dustless sanding—get the best suction, cleaner air, and faster finishing with data-driven choices.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="dustless-sanding-pick-the-right-hose-diameter"&gt;Dustless Sanding: Pick the Right Hose Diameter&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first time I tried to sand a maple tabletop in my small garage, I didn’t plan for the dust. Within minutes, a visible cloud hovered over my workbench, the air had that chalky taste, and the light from the door turned into a foggy beam. The sander did its job, but the shop felt uninhabitable. Fast-forward to today, and my setup looks completely different: a quiet extractor hums under the bench, a smooth-bore hose clips into a sander with a snug port connection, and the cleanup is mostly emptying a bag. The shift to dustless sanding wasn’t just about comfort—it was about control. Once you understand how hose diameter, hose length, and vacuum performance interact, you can tune a system that captures chips and submicron dust instead of aerosolizing it.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding/cards/facebook/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding/cards/facebook/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding/cards/facebook/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding/cards/instagram/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding/cards/instagram/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding/cards/instagram/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding/cards/pinterest/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding/cards/pinterest/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding/cards/pinterest/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding/cards/facebook/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding/cards/facebook/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding/cards/facebook/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Keep Surfaces Flat With Rigid Blocks</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 05 Nov 2025 15:23:32 +0000</pubDate><category>Sanding Blocks</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>sanding block</category><description>Learn how rigid sanding blocks keep surfaces flat, when to use them, and the techniques, materials, and tips that deliver flawless, true results.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="keep-surfaces-flat-with-a-rigid-sanding-block"&gt;Keep Surfaces Flat with a Rigid Sanding Block&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a moment in any refinishing project when your eye catches the light just right and you see it: subtle waves in a tabletop, a faint ripple in primer, a break in the reflections across a glossy guitar body. You feel it with your fingertips too—those barely-there rises and dips that make the difference between “good enough” and “crafted.” I remember the first time I noticed how my results changed when I switched from a soft pad to a rigid sanding block. The surface I thought was “close” suddenly told the truth. Within a few careful passes, the highs dulled evenly and the lows showed as untouched pencil marks. In minutes, the surface was flatter than I’d ever achieved before.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/cards/facebook/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/cards/facebook/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/cards/facebook/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/cards/instagram/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/cards/instagram/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/cards/instagram/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/cards/facebook/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/cards/facebook/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/cards/facebook/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>13</readingTime></item><item><title>Best Grit For Sanding Between Coats Of Polyurethane</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 05 Nov 2025 04:59:16 +0000</pubDate><category>Between-Coats Sanding</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>dry sanding</category><category>clear coat</category><category>sanding block</category><description>Learn the best grit for sanding between coats of polyurethane, when to sand, and how to get a flawless, dust-free finish with pro-tested techniques.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="between-coats-sanding-best-grit-for-polyurethane"&gt;Between Coats Sanding: Best Grit for Polyurethane&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first time you run your hand across a newly finished table and feel the faint drag of tiny dust nibs, you understand why the small steps matter. Maybe it’s a maple dining top you’ve been nursing through long evenings, or a simple pine shelf that somehow carries outsized meaning. You’ve brushed on a smooth coat, waited patiently, and yet—under a raking light—tiny specks wink back at you like a constellation you didn’t intend to draw. That’s the moment when many projects turn from “good enough” to “I want this perfect.” And the bridge to perfect is almost always between coats sanding.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding/cards/instagram/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding/cards/instagram/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding/cards/instagram/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding/cards/pinterest/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding/cards/pinterest/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding/cards/pinterest/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Scuff Sand Glossy Paint To Improve Primer Adhesion</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 05 Nov 2025 04:18:59 +0000</pubDate><category>Paint Removal &amp; Surface Prep</category><category>paint prep</category><category>rust removal</category><category>primer coat</category><category>sanding block</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>dust control</category><description>Learn how to scuff sand glossy paint for superior primer adhesion.

&lt;p&gt;There’s a moment every DIYer knows: coffee in hand, paint tray loaded, roller whispering across the wall—and then the dreaded slip. The glossy trim or cabinet door you thought you tamed suddenly sheds the new coat like a rain jacket, beading, sliding, or peeling on touch. I’ve been in that room more times than I can count, from weekend bathrooms to full commercial corridors, and the conclusion’s always the same—before color comes control. That control starts with surface preparation. Not flashy, not glamorous, but it’s the one step that makes every coat after it look better and last longer.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation/cards/facebook/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation/cards/facebook/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation/cards/facebook/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation/cards/instagram/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation/cards/instagram/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation/cards/instagram/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation/cards/pinterest/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation/cards/pinterest/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation/cards/pinterest/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation/cards/facebook/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation/cards/facebook/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation/cards/facebook/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Crosshatch Sanding Pattern For Even Clear Coat Leveling</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 05 Nov 2025 00:59:26 +0000</pubDate><category>Wet Sanding Clear Coat</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-2500</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>clear coat</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>sanding block</category><description>Learn the crosshatch sanding pattern for even clear coat leveling—tools, grits, steps, and pro tips for a flat, glossy, mirror-like finish.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="crosshatch-sanding-for-clear-coat-leveling"&gt;Crosshatch Sanding for Clear Coat Leveling&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You notice it first when the sun dips behind a cloud. Your car—or maybe that guitar body you’ve been refinishing—looked perfect in full daylight. But now a soft, diffused glow reveals a faint orange peel, a sprinkling of swirls, and the slightest rippling along a contour line. It’s not ruined, but it’s not the glassy surface you had in mind. The promise of a flawless finish is what pulls many of us into the workshop on a Saturday morning, and it’s what makes techniques like clear coat leveling feel less like a chore and more like craftsmanship. What you need isn’t more product or a heavier hand; it’s a repeatable way to flatten texture without taking unnecessary risks.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling/cards/facebook/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling/cards/facebook/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling/cards/facebook/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling/cards/instagram/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling/cards/instagram/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling/cards/instagram/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling/cards/pinterest/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling/cards/pinterest/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling/cards/pinterest/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling/cards/facebook/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling/cards/facebook/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling/cards/facebook/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>How To Sand Crown Molding Profiles Without Flattening</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 04 Nov 2025 16:44:08 +0000</pubDate><category>Trim &amp; Molding Sanding</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>sanding block</category><category>primer coat</category><category>dust control</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Learn how to sand crown molding without flattening profiles.

&lt;p&gt;On a quiet Saturday morning, you finally pull the drop cloths over your living room floor and tilt a lamp toward the ceiling. The crown molding looks elegant from a distance, but up close the paint has chipped at the corners and the once-crisp beads have gone a little blurry. You run a fingertip along a cove that should feel like a clean arc, and instead it’s a soft bump. That’s the moment when most DIYers decide to sand—and the moment many profiles lose their sharp character. The goal isn’t to erase the molding’s shape; it’s to refine the surface. With a thoughtful approach to molding sanding, you can keep each flare, bead, and cove true while preparing for a flawless new finish.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding/cards/instagram/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding/cards/instagram/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding/cards/instagram/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>How To Sand Wood By Hand For Smooth Finish</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 04 Nov 2025 03:41:00 +0000</pubDate><category>Hand Sanding Techniques</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>sanding block</category><category>grit progression</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>Learn hand sanding techniques, grit progression, and pro tips to achieve a flawless smooth wood finish with clear steps, tools, and troubleshooting.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="hand-sanding-for-a-glass-smooth-wood-finish"&gt;Hand sanding for a glass-smooth wood finish&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a quiet Saturday morning, the house is still enough to hear the tiny rasp of paper against wood. Sunlight falls across the table you’ve promised to restore—the one that’s been gathering keys, grocery bags, and happy-hour mail for years. At first glance, it seems fine. But run your fingertips from the center to the edge and you can feel a map of dents, glue drips, and faint chatter lines left by the last sander. This is where patience matters. This is where hand sanding earns its reputation.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding/cards/instagram/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding/cards/instagram/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding/cards/instagram/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Low Voc Binder Options For Abrasives</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 04 Nov 2025 03:24:31 +0000</pubDate><category>Eco &amp; Non-Toxic Abrasives</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-800</category><category>sanding block</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>clear coat</category><description>Low-VOC binder guide for eco sandpaper: materials, performance tradeoffs, and a step-by-step shop workflow for cleaner, pro-grade sanding.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="eco-sandpaper-low-voc-binder-options-that-work"&gt;Eco Sandpaper: Low-VOC Binder Options That Work&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know that smell the minute you crack open the shop on a warm morning—the stale bite of solvents baked into the air, the stuff that lingers in your nose long after the last pass with the sanding block. That’s the old world of abrasives talking. As a cabinetmaker turned workshop coach, I’ve logged hundreds of hours testing sheets, belts, and discs that either left my head buzzing or my surfaces butter-smooth. These days, the best of both worlds is real: low-VOC binders in eco sandpaper that can hold grit like a bulldog, resist loading, and let you breathe easier in a small shop without a giant extractor humming all day.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/cards/instagram/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/cards/instagram/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/cards/instagram/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Sic Versus Aluminum Oxide Differences</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 04 Nov 2025 02:51:33 +0000</pubDate><category>Abrasive Materials &amp; Compounds</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>dry sanding</category><category>clear coat</category><category>orbital sander</category><category>sanding block</category><description>Compare silicon carbide sandpaper and aluminum oxide to choose the right abrasive for wood, metal, and paint.

&lt;p&gt;On a quiet Saturday afternoon, you clamp down the last door of that heirloom dresser you’ve been restoring. The grain finally shows through the old varnish, but the surface still isn’t the mirror-smooth finish you pictured. You reach for a fresh sheet, feel the grit with your thumb, and hesitate—this is where the choice between silicon carbide sandpaper and aluminum oxide decides whether you’ll spend the evening admiring your work or chasing scratches you didn’t mean to make. Maybe you’re here because a paint finish went cloudy after dry sanding, or a clear coat took a hopscotch of swirls under shop lights. Or maybe your belt sander chewed through hook-and-loop discs like a wood chipper and you need something tougher and more predictable.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/instagram/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/instagram/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/instagram/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>13</readingTime></item><item><title>Coarse Medium Fine And Ultra Fine Definitions</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/coarse-medium-fine-and-ultra-fine-definitions-sandpaper-grit/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/coarse-medium-fine-and-ultra-fine-definitions-sandpaper-grit/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 05:39:06 +0000</pubDate><category>Grit Range &amp; Classification</category><category>grit-101</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-180</category><category>clear coat</category><category>sanding block</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Understand coarse, medium, fine, and ultra fine sandpaper grit with practical steps, pro tips, and troubleshooting for flawless surfaces.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="coarse-to-ultra-fine-sandpaper-grit-decoded"&gt;Coarse to Ultra Fine: Sandpaper Grit Decoded&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning in the shop. Coffee on the bench, a drop cloth draped over a dented heirloom dresser you promised to rescue. You pull open the top drawer and the musty smell of old lacquer and stubborn pine dust hits the air. A sanding block lies beside a stack of sheets you picked up at the hardware store—some marked 60, others 120, 220, even 400. You know each number stands for a sandpaper grit, but right now they feel like a foreign language. The last time you “winged it,” you left swirl marks that telegraphed straight through your stain, and spent another weekend fixing what you rushed the first time.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/coarse-medium-fine-and-ultra-fine-definitions-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/coarse-medium-fine-and-ultra-fine-definitions-sandpaper-grit.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/coarse-medium-fine-and-ultra-fine-definitions-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/coarse-medium-fine-and-ultra-fine-definitions-sandpaper-grit.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/coarse-medium-fine-and-ultra-fine-definitions-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/coarse-medium-fine-and-ultra-fine-definitions-sandpaper-grit.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/coarse-medium-fine-and-ultra-fine-definitions-sandpaper-grit/cards/instagram/coarse-medium-fine-and-ultra-fine-definitions-sandpaper-grit.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/coarse-medium-fine-and-ultra-fine-definitions-sandpaper-grit/cards/instagram/coarse-medium-fine-and-ultra-fine-definitions-sandpaper-grit.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/coarse-medium-fine-and-ultra-fine-definitions-sandpaper-grit/cards/instagram/coarse-medium-fine-and-ultra-fine-definitions-sandpaper-grit.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/coarse-medium-fine-and-ultra-fine-definitions-sandpaper-grit/cards/pinterest/coarse-medium-fine-and-ultra-fine-definitions-sandpaper-grit.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/coarse-medium-fine-and-ultra-fine-definitions-sandpaper-grit/cards/pinterest/coarse-medium-fine-and-ultra-fine-definitions-sandpaper-grit.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/coarse-medium-fine-and-ultra-fine-definitions-sandpaper-grit/cards/pinterest/coarse-medium-fine-and-ultra-fine-definitions-sandpaper-grit.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/coarse-medium-fine-and-ultra-fine-definitions-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/coarse-medium-fine-and-ultra-fine-definitions-sandpaper-grit.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/coarse-medium-fine-and-ultra-fine-definitions-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/coarse-medium-fine-and-ultra-fine-definitions-sandpaper-grit.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/coarse-medium-fine-and-ultra-fine-definitions-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/coarse-medium-fine-and-ultra-fine-definitions-sandpaper-grit.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>When To Use Sanding Blocks Versus Bare Hand</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 02:57:35 +0000</pubDate><category>Sanding Blocks</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>sanding block</category><category>dry sanding</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Learn when to use a sanding block versus bare-hand sanding for flawless finishes.

&lt;p&gt;The first pass of the evening always tells you how the job will go. You clamp a pine shelf to the bench, switch on the task light, and run your fingertips across a coat of primer that’s not quite right—dust nibs, a few raised grain lines, a ridge where you filled a knot. The shop is quiet except for the small rasp of paper as you tear a new sheet. You think about reaching for your trusty sanding block, the one that’s squared a hundred edges and leveled just as many fills. Then you pause. The shelf has a soft, rounded front, and you can feel a subtle dip near the corner. A hard block might flatten more than you want. Your bare hand, wrapped around a fold of 320-grit, could trace the curve and polish it without flattening the profile. This is the moment that separates a good finish from a great one: choosing the right sanding approach for the surface in front of you.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block/cards/facebook/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block/cards/facebook/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block/cards/facebook/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block/cards/instagram/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block/cards/instagram/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block/cards/instagram/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block/cards/facebook/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block/cards/facebook/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block/cards/facebook/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>13</readingTime></item><item><title>What Grit To Remove Peeling Paint From Wood Trim</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/what-grit-to-remove-peeling-paint-from-wood-trim-paint-removal-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/what-grit-to-remove-peeling-paint-from-wood-trim-paint-removal-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 00:03:42 +0000</pubDate><category>Paint Removal &amp; Surface Prep</category><category>paint prep</category><category>rust removal</category><category>primer coat</category><category>sanding block</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><description>Discover expert tips on paint removal sanding for wood trim.

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picture this: a cozy afternoon, the sun filtering through your living room windows, casting warm beams onto your worn-out wood trim. You’ve always loved the character that these old trims bring to your home, but the layers of peeling paint have long lost their charm.

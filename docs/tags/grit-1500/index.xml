&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning in the shop, coffee steaming on the bench, the hood you painted last weekend stares back with a stubborn peel and a couple of dust nibs. There’s a bucket by your boots and a fistful of dark gray sheets curling at the corners. You know the next hour will make or break the finish—this is the moment where patience and process turn wavy reflections into a razor-straight mirror. When you’re wet sanding clear coat, the way you prepare your abrasives—specifically how long you soak them—can be the difference between an easy, controlled cut and a chewed-up mess that forces a respray. I’ve watched pros ruin perfect paint because they rushed the soak. I’ve also seen hobbyists hit glass-smooth results their first time by dialing in this one simple variable.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/05.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/26/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-paper-or-discs-before-use-wet-sanding-clear-coat/cards/facebook/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-paper-or-discs-before-use-wet-sanding-clear-coat.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/26/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-paper-or-discs-before-use-wet-sanding-clear-coat/cards/facebook/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-paper-or-discs-before-use-wet-sanding-clear-coat.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/26/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-paper-or-discs-before-use-wet-sanding-clear-coat/cards/facebook/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-paper-or-discs-before-use-wet-sanding-clear-coat.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/26/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-paper-or-discs-before-use-wet-sanding-clear-coat/cards/instagram/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-paper-or-discs-before-use-wet-sanding-clear-coat.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/26/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-paper-or-discs-before-use-wet-sanding-clear-coat/cards/instagram/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-paper-or-discs-before-use-wet-sanding-clear-coat.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/26/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-paper-or-discs-before-use-wet-sanding-clear-coat/cards/instagram/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-paper-or-discs-before-use-wet-sanding-clear-coat.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/26/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-paper-or-discs-before-use-wet-sanding-clear-coat/cards/pinterest/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-paper-or-discs-before-use-wet-sanding-clear-coat.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/26/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-paper-or-discs-before-use-wet-sanding-clear-coat/cards/pinterest/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-paper-or-discs-before-use-wet-sanding-clear-coat.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/26/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-paper-or-discs-before-use-wet-sanding-clear-coat/cards/pinterest/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-paper-or-discs-before-use-wet-sanding-clear-coat.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/26/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-paper-or-discs-before-use-wet-sanding-clear-coat/cards/facebook/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-paper-or-discs-before-use-wet-sanding-clear-coat.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/26/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-paper-or-discs-before-use-wet-sanding-clear-coat/cards/facebook/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-paper-or-discs-before-use-wet-sanding-clear-coat.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/26/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-paper-or-discs-before-use-wet-sanding-clear-coat/cards/facebook/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-paper-or-discs-before-use-wet-sanding-clear-coat.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Strip Or Sand First When Refinishing Furniture Pieces</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/23/strip-or-sand-first-when-refinishing-furniture-pieces-furniture-refinishing/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/23/strip-or-sand-first-when-refinishing-furniture-pieces-furniture-refinishing/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 13:41:01 +0000</pubDate><category>Furniture Refinishing</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Engineer-tested guide on whether to strip or sand first in furniture refinishing, with abrasive science, timing data, and practical workflows.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="strip-or-sand-first-in-furniture-refinishing"&gt;Strip or Sand First in Furniture Refinishing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a cool Saturday morning, I pulled a walnut end table out of an estate-sale pile and set it on sawhorses. Sunlight revealed a familiar crime scene: worn edges, water rings, and a thick amber film that felt rubbery under my fingernail. The decision every restorer faces came next—do I strip the finish chemically or start sanding? In furniture refinishing, that single choice sets the tone for your entire project: speed, mess, surface quality, and even whether you’ll preserve crisp details or blunt them away.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/24.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/23/strip-or-sand-first-when-refinishing-furniture-pieces-furniture-refinishing/cards/facebook/strip-or-sand-first-when-refinishing-furniture-pieces-furniture-refinishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/23/strip-or-sand-first-when-refinishing-furniture-pieces-furniture-refinishing/cards/facebook/strip-or-sand-first-when-refinishing-furniture-pieces-furniture-refinishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/23/strip-or-sand-first-when-refinishing-furniture-pieces-furniture-refinishing/cards/facebook/strip-or-sand-first-when-refinishing-furniture-pieces-furniture-refinishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/23/strip-or-sand-first-when-refinishing-furniture-pieces-furniture-refinishing/cards/instagram/strip-or-sand-first-when-refinishing-furniture-pieces-furniture-refinishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/23/strip-or-sand-first-when-refinishing-furniture-pieces-furniture-refinishing/cards/instagram/strip-or-sand-first-when-refinishing-furniture-pieces-furniture-refinishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/23/strip-or-sand-first-when-refinishing-furniture-pieces-furniture-refinishing/cards/instagram/strip-or-sand-first-when-refinishing-furniture-pieces-furniture-refinishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/23/strip-or-sand-first-when-refinishing-furniture-pieces-furniture-refinishing/cards/pinterest/strip-or-sand-first-when-refinishing-furniture-pieces-furniture-refinishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/23/strip-or-sand-first-when-refinishing-furniture-pieces-furniture-refinishing/cards/pinterest/strip-or-sand-first-when-refinishing-furniture-pieces-furniture-refinishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/23/strip-or-sand-first-when-refinishing-furniture-pieces-furniture-refinishing/cards/pinterest/strip-or-sand-first-when-refinishing-furniture-pieces-furniture-refinishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/23/strip-or-sand-first-when-refinishing-furniture-pieces-furniture-refinishing/cards/facebook/strip-or-sand-first-when-refinishing-furniture-pieces-furniture-refinishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/23/strip-or-sand-first-when-refinishing-furniture-pieces-furniture-refinishing/cards/facebook/strip-or-sand-first-when-refinishing-furniture-pieces-furniture-refinishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/23/strip-or-sand-first-when-refinishing-furniture-pieces-furniture-refinishing/cards/facebook/strip-or-sand-first-when-refinishing-furniture-pieces-furniture-refinishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Edge Tool Blending With Main Field</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-tool-blending-with-main-field-concrete-polishing/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-tool-blending-with-main-field-concrete-polishing/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 15:29:17 +0000</pubDate><category>Stone &amp; Concrete Polishing</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Engineer-tested methods to blend edges with the main field in concrete polishing.

&lt;p&gt;You notice it first at the baseboards. Morning light lands across a kitchen floor that otherwise looks like poured glass, and the edges flash a dull, scratchy halo. In a boutique retail space, the center field mirrors the fixtures, but at the columns and along the walls, the reflection breaks—hazy, slightly orange-peeled, almost like it came from a different contractor. As a product engineer who reviews abrasives and machines for a living, I see this edge-to-field mismatch often, even on projects that nailed aggregate exposure and gloss in the main run. It’s not because teams don’t care; it’s because edge blending is where real-world constraints collide with the material science of concrete polishing: smaller tools, different pressure and speed, heat, slurry load, and changing paste content near walls.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/08.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-tool-blending-with-main-field-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/edge-tool-blending-with-main-field-concrete-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-tool-blending-with-main-field-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/edge-tool-blending-with-main-field-concrete-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-tool-blending-with-main-field-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/edge-tool-blending-with-main-field-concrete-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-tool-blending-with-main-field-concrete-polishing/cards/instagram/edge-tool-blending-with-main-field-concrete-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-tool-blending-with-main-field-concrete-polishing/cards/instagram/edge-tool-blending-with-main-field-concrete-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-tool-blending-with-main-field-concrete-polishing/cards/instagram/edge-tool-blending-with-main-field-concrete-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-tool-blending-with-main-field-concrete-polishing/cards/pinterest/edge-tool-blending-with-main-field-concrete-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-tool-blending-with-main-field-concrete-polishing/cards/pinterest/edge-tool-blending-with-main-field-concrete-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-tool-blending-with-main-field-concrete-polishing/cards/pinterest/edge-tool-blending-with-main-field-concrete-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-tool-blending-with-main-field-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/edge-tool-blending-with-main-field-concrete-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-tool-blending-with-main-field-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/edge-tool-blending-with-main-field-concrete-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-tool-blending-with-main-field-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/edge-tool-blending-with-main-field-concrete-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Hone Ceramic Tile Edges Uniformly</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/18/hone-ceramic-tile-edges-uniformly-glass-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/18/hone-ceramic-tile-edges-uniformly-glass-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 18 Dec 2025 13:48:40 +0000</pubDate><category>Glass &amp; Ceramics Sanding</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-1500</category><description>with methods inspired by glass sanding.

&lt;p&gt;You notice it first with your fingertips. The bathroom is almost finished—the new vanity, the grout drying to a warm gray, the light bouncing off fresh ceramic. But as you reach to wipe away a stray haze line, a sharp corner catches your skin. It’s tiny, the sort of edge that doesn’t look like much, yet it steals the comfort from the space an inch at a time. Uniformly honed tile edges are what make a shower niche feel intentional, a kitchen backsplash look built-in rather than glued on. The margin between “nice” and “nailed it” often lives right there—at the line where glaze, clay, and air meet.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/04.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/18/hone-ceramic-tile-edges-uniformly-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/hone-ceramic-tile-edges-uniformly-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/18/hone-ceramic-tile-edges-uniformly-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/hone-ceramic-tile-edges-uniformly-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/18/hone-ceramic-tile-edges-uniformly-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/hone-ceramic-tile-edges-uniformly-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/18/hone-ceramic-tile-edges-uniformly-glass-sanding/cards/instagram/hone-ceramic-tile-edges-uniformly-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/18/hone-ceramic-tile-edges-uniformly-glass-sanding/cards/instagram/hone-ceramic-tile-edges-uniformly-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/18/hone-ceramic-tile-edges-uniformly-glass-sanding/cards/instagram/hone-ceramic-tile-edges-uniformly-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/18/hone-ceramic-tile-edges-uniformly-glass-sanding/cards/pinterest/hone-ceramic-tile-edges-uniformly-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/18/hone-ceramic-tile-edges-uniformly-glass-sanding/cards/pinterest/hone-ceramic-tile-edges-uniformly-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/18/hone-ceramic-tile-edges-uniformly-glass-sanding/cards/pinterest/hone-ceramic-tile-edges-uniformly-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/18/hone-ceramic-tile-edges-uniformly-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/hone-ceramic-tile-edges-uniformly-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/18/hone-ceramic-tile-edges-uniformly-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/hone-ceramic-tile-edges-uniformly-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/18/hone-ceramic-tile-edges-uniformly-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/hone-ceramic-tile-edges-uniformly-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Identify Hard Factory Coating Versus Simple Surface Oxidation</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 13:41:15 +0000</pubDate><category>Headlight Restoration</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>clear coat</category><description>Learn to spot hard factory coatings vs. simple oxidation on plastics, then restore safely with step-by-step sanding, polishing, and protection.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="plastic-oxidation-removal-coating-vs-surface-oxide"&gt;Plastic Oxidation Removal: Coating vs. Surface Oxide&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning in the shop, coffee ring on the bench, you wipe a thumb across a chalky ATV fender and it ghosts your finger white. Ten feet away, the headlight lens on your daily driver looks foggy and amber; a quick pass with glass cleaner does nothing. On a trailer, the kayak’s once-deep orange now reads as flat and pinkish. If you’ve been hunting for plastic oxidation removal tips, you’re halfway there—but here’s the catch: not all dull plastic is just oxidation. Sometimes you’re seeing degradation of a hard factory coating, and sometimes it’s a thin film of chalk oxidized from the base material itself. Treat them the same and you’ll either stop too early—leaving haze—or go too far—burning through a protective layer you actually needed.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/20.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation/cards/facebook/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation/cards/facebook/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation/cards/facebook/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation/cards/instagram/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation/cards/instagram/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation/cards/instagram/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation/cards/pinterest/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation/cards/pinterest/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation/cards/pinterest/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation/cards/facebook/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation/cards/facebook/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation/cards/facebook/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Refine To 2000–3000 For Quick Polish</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 01 Dec 2025 15:17:23 +0000</pubDate><category>Plastic &amp; Epoxy Sanding</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>Master epoxy sanding from 800 to 2000–3000 grit for a fast, haze-free polish with pro-level technique, abrasives, and workflow control.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="epoxy-sanding-quick-polish-at-20003000-grit"&gt;Epoxy Sanding: Quick Polish at 2000–3000 Grit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You set the project down with both hands, the way you place a full coffee mug on a brand-new table—carefully, like it could bruise. Yesterday it was a cloudy slab: dust nibs, tiny ripples, a faint orange peel. Today, it’s close. Under the shop LEDs, you can already see straight lines in the reflection, but not a perfect mirror—still a little fog, still a couple of shallow witness lines that your eyes keep returning to. The moment is tempting: grab a compound and try to bully the gloss into existence. But you’ve done this long enough to know that shine doesn’t come from polish alone; it’s earned in the scratch pattern. This is where epoxy sanding decides whether you’ll be buffing for minutes or for hours, whether the finish will hold up in sunlight or betray you with haloed swirls.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/13.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding/cards/instagram/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding/cards/instagram/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding/cards/instagram/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding/cards/pinterest/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding/cards/pinterest/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding/cards/pinterest/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Best Polishing Sequence After Wet Sanding</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-polishing-sequence-after-wet-sanding-polishing-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-polishing-sequence-after-wet-sanding-polishing-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 16:16:32 +0000</pubDate><category>Polishing &amp; Finishing</category><category>mirror finish</category><category>polishing pads</category><category>grit progression</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>clear coat</category><description>Learn the best polishing sequence after wet sanding.

&lt;p&gt;Picture this: late Saturday, lights humming in the garage, a quiet radio in the background, and the last sheet of wet/dry in your hand. The clear coat is dead-flat from your final passes, but it looks dull and grey—like all the gloss vanished. You run a finger across the panel and the surface feels flawless, almost sticky-smooth. That’s the moment when most DIYers wonder, “Now what?” The answer is a deliberate polishing sequence—and the right polishing sandpaper setup before you even plug in the machine. Whether you’re chasing a mirror finish on a freshly sprayed fender, a varnished guitar body, or a gelcoat corner on a boat hatch, what happens next determines whether you get a show-car sheen or a halo of haze.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/14.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-polishing-sequence-after-wet-sanding-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/best-polishing-sequence-after-wet-sanding-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-polishing-sequence-after-wet-sanding-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/best-polishing-sequence-after-wet-sanding-polishing-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-polishing-sequence-after-wet-sanding-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/best-polishing-sequence-after-wet-sanding-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-polishing-sequence-after-wet-sanding-polishing-sandpaper/cards/instagram/best-polishing-sequence-after-wet-sanding-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-polishing-sequence-after-wet-sanding-polishing-sandpaper/cards/instagram/best-polishing-sequence-after-wet-sanding-polishing-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-polishing-sequence-after-wet-sanding-polishing-sandpaper/cards/instagram/best-polishing-sequence-after-wet-sanding-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-polishing-sequence-after-wet-sanding-polishing-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/best-polishing-sequence-after-wet-sanding-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-polishing-sequence-after-wet-sanding-polishing-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/best-polishing-sequence-after-wet-sanding-polishing-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-polishing-sequence-after-wet-sanding-polishing-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/best-polishing-sequence-after-wet-sanding-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-polishing-sequence-after-wet-sanding-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/best-polishing-sequence-after-wet-sanding-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-polishing-sequence-after-wet-sanding-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/best-polishing-sequence-after-wet-sanding-polishing-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-polishing-sequence-after-wet-sanding-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/best-polishing-sequence-after-wet-sanding-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Choose Tripoli Versus White Rouge For Metal Polishing</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/choose-tripoli-versus-white-rouge-for-metal-polishing-metal-polishing/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/choose-tripoli-versus-white-rouge-for-metal-polishing-metal-polishing/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 23 Nov 2025 13:58:51 +0000</pubDate><category>Metal Polishing &amp; Rust Repair</category><category>grit-1200</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>metal polishing</category><description>Understand Tripoli vs white rouge, choose the right wheel, and build a fast, safe metal polishing workflow for aluminum, brass, and steel.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="tripoli-vs-white-rouge-metal-polishing-guide"&gt;Tripoli vs White Rouge: Metal Polishing Guide&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday light pours across your workbench. The brass cabinet pulls you removed last night look dull, like they’ve filed away years of handprints and turned them matte. Nearby, the stainless kettle you use every morning is fine but not pristine—tiny swirls catch the sun. You set out the tools you have: a bench grinder with buffing wheels, two mystery compound bars—one brown, one white—and a quiet hope that today’s the day your pieces go from “cleaned up” to truly gleaming. If you’ve ever stood in this exact moment, ready to begin but unsure which bar to reach for, you’re not alone. Metal polishing is both craft and sequence, and the right choice at the right time matters.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/08.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/choose-tripoli-versus-white-rouge-for-metal-polishing-metal-polishing/cards/facebook/choose-tripoli-versus-white-rouge-for-metal-polishing-metal-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/choose-tripoli-versus-white-rouge-for-metal-polishing-metal-polishing/cards/facebook/choose-tripoli-versus-white-rouge-for-metal-polishing-metal-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/choose-tripoli-versus-white-rouge-for-metal-polishing-metal-polishing/cards/facebook/choose-tripoli-versus-white-rouge-for-metal-polishing-metal-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/choose-tripoli-versus-white-rouge-for-metal-polishing-metal-polishing/cards/instagram/choose-tripoli-versus-white-rouge-for-metal-polishing-metal-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/choose-tripoli-versus-white-rouge-for-metal-polishing-metal-polishing/cards/instagram/choose-tripoli-versus-white-rouge-for-metal-polishing-metal-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/choose-tripoli-versus-white-rouge-for-metal-polishing-metal-polishing/cards/instagram/choose-tripoli-versus-white-rouge-for-metal-polishing-metal-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/choose-tripoli-versus-white-rouge-for-metal-polishing-metal-polishing/cards/pinterest/choose-tripoli-versus-white-rouge-for-metal-polishing-metal-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/choose-tripoli-versus-white-rouge-for-metal-polishing-metal-polishing/cards/pinterest/choose-tripoli-versus-white-rouge-for-metal-polishing-metal-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/choose-tripoli-versus-white-rouge-for-metal-polishing-metal-polishing/cards/pinterest/choose-tripoli-versus-white-rouge-for-metal-polishing-metal-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/choose-tripoli-versus-white-rouge-for-metal-polishing-metal-polishing/cards/facebook/choose-tripoli-versus-white-rouge-for-metal-polishing-metal-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/choose-tripoli-versus-white-rouge-for-metal-polishing-metal-polishing/cards/facebook/choose-tripoli-versus-white-rouge-for-metal-polishing-metal-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/choose-tripoli-versus-white-rouge-for-metal-polishing-metal-polishing/cards/facebook/choose-tripoli-versus-white-rouge-for-metal-polishing-metal-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Why Uv Protective Clear Coat Is Required After Restoration</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 23 Nov 2025 13:28:43 +0000</pubDate><category>Headlight Restoration</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>clear coat</category><category>wet sanding</category><description>Discover why a UV clear coat is vital after restoration.

&lt;p&gt;You know that moment when the shop door rolls up, the morning light hits your freshly restored project, and you catch the reflection—crisp, glassy, and clean? Whether it’s a set of previously cloudy headlights, an oxidized hood you’ve cut and polished, or a faded motorcycle fairing you’ve brought back to life, it feels like breathing new air. I’ve been there on a Saturday morning, rag in one hand, inspection light in the other, admiring that deep clarity. It’s the quiet pride of a job well done. But here’s the tough-love truth: without a UV clear coat to seal that clarity, the sun will start undoing your work the second you roll outside.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/06.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat/cards/facebook/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat/cards/facebook/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat/cards/facebook/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat/cards/instagram/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat/cards/instagram/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat/cards/instagram/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat/cards/pinterest/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat/cards/pinterest/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat/cards/pinterest/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat/cards/facebook/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat/cards/facebook/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat/cards/facebook/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Full Orange Peel Removal Versus Texture Match To Oem Finish</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/full-orange-peel-removal-versus-texture-match-to-oem-finish-orange-peel-removal/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/full-orange-peel-removal-versus-texture-match-to-oem-finish-orange-peel-removal/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 22 Nov 2025 13:28:52 +0000</pubDate><category>Wet Sanding Clear Coat</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Engineer-tested guide comparing full orange peel removal to OEM texture matching, with measurements, workflows, and tool recommendations.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="orange-peel-removal-vs-oem-texture-match"&gt;Orange Peel Removal vs OEM Texture Match&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You notice it every time the sun breaks through the carport: the hood looks like a clear lake ruffled by a breeze. Not scratched, not dirty—just textured. You run your fingertips across it and feel… nothing. The gloss is there, the reflections are bright, but the lines of your neighbor’s fence warp and shimmer. That’s orange peel. It’s a finish most modern cars ship with on purpose—partly the byproduct of efficient high-solids clearcoats and fast robotic spray passes, partly an aesthetic choice that many automakers prefer for its way of masking minor defects and giving panels a sort of visual “softness.”&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/04.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/full-orange-peel-removal-versus-texture-match-to-oem-finish-orange-peel-removal/cards/facebook/full-orange-peel-removal-versus-texture-match-to-oem-finish-orange-peel-removal.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/full-orange-peel-removal-versus-texture-match-to-oem-finish-orange-peel-removal/cards/facebook/full-orange-peel-removal-versus-texture-match-to-oem-finish-orange-peel-removal.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/full-orange-peel-removal-versus-texture-match-to-oem-finish-orange-peel-removal/cards/facebook/full-orange-peel-removal-versus-texture-match-to-oem-finish-orange-peel-removal.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/full-orange-peel-removal-versus-texture-match-to-oem-finish-orange-peel-removal/cards/instagram/full-orange-peel-removal-versus-texture-match-to-oem-finish-orange-peel-removal.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/full-orange-peel-removal-versus-texture-match-to-oem-finish-orange-peel-removal/cards/instagram/full-orange-peel-removal-versus-texture-match-to-oem-finish-orange-peel-removal.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/full-orange-peel-removal-versus-texture-match-to-oem-finish-orange-peel-removal/cards/instagram/full-orange-peel-removal-versus-texture-match-to-oem-finish-orange-peel-removal.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/full-orange-peel-removal-versus-texture-match-to-oem-finish-orange-peel-removal/cards/pinterest/full-orange-peel-removal-versus-texture-match-to-oem-finish-orange-peel-removal.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/full-orange-peel-removal-versus-texture-match-to-oem-finish-orange-peel-removal/cards/pinterest/full-orange-peel-removal-versus-texture-match-to-oem-finish-orange-peel-removal.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/full-orange-peel-removal-versus-texture-match-to-oem-finish-orange-peel-removal/cards/pinterest/full-orange-peel-removal-versus-texture-match-to-oem-finish-orange-peel-removal.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/full-orange-peel-removal-versus-texture-match-to-oem-finish-orange-peel-removal/cards/facebook/full-orange-peel-removal-versus-texture-match-to-oem-finish-orange-peel-removal.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/full-orange-peel-removal-versus-texture-match-to-oem-finish-orange-peel-removal/cards/facebook/full-orange-peel-removal-versus-texture-match-to-oem-finish-orange-peel-removal.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/full-orange-peel-removal-versus-texture-match-to-oem-finish-orange-peel-removal/cards/facebook/full-orange-peel-removal-versus-texture-match-to-oem-finish-orange-peel-removal.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Cut Rate And Loading Behavior By Grain</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2025 00:57:05 +0000</pubDate><category>Abrasive Materials &amp; Compounds</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>clear coat</category><category>orbital sander</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>Engineer’s guide to silicon carbide sandpaper—cut rate, loading, grain physics, and practical tips to choose the right abrasive for paint, metal, and</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="silicon-carbide-sandpaper-cut-rate-and-loading"&gt;Silicon Carbide Sandpaper: Cut Rate and Loading&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning in the garage, the air smelled faintly of cut clear coat and soapy water. A half-finished motorcycle tank sat on a foam cradle, its orange peel and dust nibs highlighted by a raking LED panel. I’d already tried a few sheets of 1500 grit from a contractor pack, but they stalled after a few passes, loading with milky slurry and leaving stray scratches that would require more polish later. This is the moment that separates a casual sand from a dependable workflow—the point where abrasive choice dictates not just speed, but consistency and finish quality. Swapping to silicon carbide sandpaper felt like a small change, but it reset the process: faster leveling, more controllable scratch patterns, and fewer surprise defects.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/09.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/instagram/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/instagram/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/instagram/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Choose Pad And Compound For Plastics</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 13:37:22 +0000</pubDate><category>Resin Polishing</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>grit progression</category><category>sanding block</category><category>polishing pads</category><description>Engineer’s guide to resin polishing: pick the right pad and compound for acrylic, polycarbonate, and epoxy.

&lt;p&gt;On a quiet Saturday, I watched a friend slowly lower a buffing pad onto the cloudy edge of his epoxy river table. The coffee mugs had left fine scuffs; sunlight turned them into halos. He’d already tried an all-purpose metal polish and a “universal” wool pad—both grabbed hard, smeared the surface, and left the epoxy warmer than I liked. He looked at me and asked the question I hear weekly: “Which pad and which compound do I actually use for plastics?” It’s an honest question with costly consequences if you guess wrong. Unlike metal paint systems that tolerate a surprising amount of heat and pressure, plastics and cured resins can haze, smear, or stress-craze from a few seconds of the wrong contact.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/01.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/cards/instagram/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/cards/instagram/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/cards/instagram/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/cards/pinterest/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/cards/pinterest/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/cards/pinterest/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>13</readingTime></item><item><title>Strip Failing Polyurethane Then Sand Residue Before Refinishing</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 13:37:09 +0000</pubDate><category>Paint Removal &amp; Surface Prep</category><category>paint prep</category><category>rust removal</category><category>primer coat</category><category>sanding block</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-1500</category><description>Learn expert steps for coating removal, sanding residue, and refinishing wood for durable, beautiful results with safe methods, tools, and pro tips.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="coating-removal-and-refinishing-failing-polyurethane"&gt;Coating Removal and Refinishing Failing Polyurethane&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning light spilled across the dining table you’ve hosted around for years. You set down a mug and notice the surface clings just a little; a ring remains, faint but stubborn. Along the edges, the once-smooth finish has turned brittle and chalky, tiny flakes catching the light like dust motes in motion. You run a fingertip across the spot where a placemat lives—glossy here, dull there, with a subtle ridge between. The finish is failing, and it’s happening faster than you’d like. You can feel the stakes: this is not just a table—it’s family dinners, late-night projects, first-day-of-school photos, and the clean expanse that makes a home feel ready.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/23.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal/cards/facebook/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal/cards/facebook/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal/cards/facebook/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal/cards/instagram/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal/cards/instagram/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal/cards/instagram/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal/cards/pinterest/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal/cards/pinterest/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal/cards/pinterest/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal/cards/facebook/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal/cards/facebook/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal/cards/facebook/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Compound Versus Polish Differences For Clear Coat Finishing</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2025 05:56:37 +0000</pubDate><category>Wet Sanding Clear Coat</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-2500</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>clear coat</category><category>wet sanding</category><description>Understand compound vs polish for clear coat finishing with sanding workflows, abrasive selection, and process control for defect-free paint polishing.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="paint-polishing-compound-vs-polish-for-clear-coat"&gt;Paint polishing: compound vs polish for clear coat&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Saturday morning sun can be the most unforgiving inspector you’ll ever meet. You back the car out after a late-night respray—coffee in hand, optimism high—and the light slices across the hood like a straightedge. Orange peel you knew about, sure. But then the swirls appear, whisper-fine arcs barely visible at dusk now glaring at full volume. You feel them before you see them: the drag of a microfiber catching on texture, the way your eyes follow a ghosty hologram around a curved fender. This is the moment when “wash and wax” ends and craft begins—where surface preparation, abrasive control, and paint polishing decide whether you get a mirror or a mirage.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/17.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing/cards/facebook/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing/cards/facebook/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing/cards/facebook/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing/cards/instagram/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing/cards/instagram/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing/cards/instagram/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing/cards/pinterest/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing/cards/pinterest/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing/cards/pinterest/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing/cards/facebook/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing/cards/facebook/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing/cards/facebook/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Wet Sanding To Control Marine Dust</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 08 Nov 2025 00:54:10 +0000</pubDate><category>Marine Sanding</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>orbital sander</category><category>dry sanding</category><category>sanding block</category><category>mirror finish</category><description>Learn wet boat sanding to cut toxic dust, protect waterways, and prep your hull right.

&lt;p&gt;There’s a particular quiet to the yard before sunrise. The halyards ping, the coffee steams in a chipped thermos, and the hull you’ve been avoiding stands there like a promise you can’t put off. I’ve been on both sides of that moment—rushing, dusty, and regretting shortcuts later—and the method that changed the game for me was wet boat sanding. Not because it’s pretty, but because it’s efficient, safer for your lungs, and easier to keep the neighbors and the yard manager happy. You control the mess. You protect the water you love. And you end the day with a hull that’s flatter, cooler, and ready to bond.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding/cards/instagram/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding/cards/instagram/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding/cards/instagram/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding/cards/pinterest/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding/cards/pinterest/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding/cards/pinterest/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Remove 1500–2000 Grit Marks On Resin</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 07 Nov 2025 23:56:25 +0000</pubDate><category>Resin Polishing</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-1200</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-2500</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>dust control</category><description>Expert workflows to remove 1500–2000 grit marks on resin and achieve optical clarity with the right abrasives, compounds, and heat control.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="resin-polishing-erasing-15002000-grit-scratches"&gt;Resin Polishing: Erasing 1500–2000 Grit Scratches&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pendant looked flawless on the bench last night—glassy, color suspended in amber, edges softened just so. Then morning light hit it. Under a low-angle window beam, micro-scratches flared across the surface like frost on a windshield. You could feel your shoulders sag. You did the careful wet-sand through 1500 and 2000, kept the strokes even, swirled the slurry away. It should be done. But resin is unforgiving under raking light, and 1500–2000 grit marks hang on, whisper-thin but brutally visible. This is the moment where the craft turns from “sanding” to resin polishing: closing the cut, controlling heat, and stepping the abrasive system with intent until the surface stops being a surface and becomes a reflection.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing/cards/instagram/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing/cards/instagram/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing/cards/instagram/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing/cards/pinterest/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing/cards/pinterest/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing/cards/pinterest/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>9</readingTime></item><item><title>Let Epoxy Cure Fully Before Sanding</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 07 Nov 2025 16:25:05 +0000</pubDate><category>Plastic &amp; Epoxy Sanding</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-360</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit progression</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>Learn why letting epoxy fully cure before sanding is essential, plus timelines, tests, grit progressions, and pro tips for flawless, clear finishes.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="epoxy-sanding-why-waiting-to-cure-pays-off"&gt;Epoxy Sanding: Why Waiting to Cure Pays Off&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a point in every resin project when anticipation and restraint collide. You’ve de‑molded a river board you poured last weekend or set down a glossy flood coat on a tabletop, and the surface is whispering promises of glass-like clarity. You picture the final reveal: the light catching the grain, the resin depth turning everyday moments into a small ceremony. You also see the last mile between what is and what could be—the smoothing, refining, and polishing phase—also known as epoxy sanding. Your hands ache to pick up the sander. But this is where patience protects your craftsmanship.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding/cards/instagram/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding/cards/instagram/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding/cards/instagram/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding/cards/pinterest/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding/cards/pinterest/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding/cards/pinterest/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Soap To Water Ratio For Lubrication</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 07 Nov 2025 14:24:10 +0000</pubDate><category>Waterproof &amp; Wet/Dry Paper</category><category>grit-360</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-1200</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-2500</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>sanding block</category><description>Engineer-tested soap-to-water ratios for lubricating wet dry sandpaper on paint, wood, and metal.

&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning, a quiet garage, and a project you’ve promised yourself you’d finally finish. The headlight lenses are foggy. The table top has those telltale dust nibs in the polyurethane. A chef’s knife hangs dull on the magnetic strip, begging for bite. You fill a bucket, reach for a bottle of soap, and lay out sheets of wet dry sandpaper—ready to get to work. And then you pause. How much soap should actually go into the water? One drop? A teaspoon? More? You’ve heard “soapy water helps it glide,” but glide isn’t the only variable that matters. There’s also bite, swarf transport, scratch control, and heat. The soap-to-water ratio dictates whether you refine fast and clean—or skate on a film that kills cutting speed and blurs feedback.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/instagram/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/instagram/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/instagram/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Remove 2000 Grit Sanding Scratches Efficiently</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/remove-2000-grit-sanding-scratches-efficiently-polishing-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/remove-2000-grit-sanding-scratches-efficiently-polishing-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 05 Nov 2025 05:18:58 +0000</pubDate><category>Polishing &amp; Finishing</category><category>mirror finish</category><category>polishing pads</category><category>grit progression</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>wet sanding</category><description>Learn how to remove 2000-grit sanding scratches fast with precise workflows, polishing sandpaper selection, and pro-level compounding techniques.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="polishing-sandpaper-erasing-2000-grit-scratches"&gt;Polishing Sandpaper: Erasing 2000-Grit Scratches&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a quiet Saturday morning, the garage feels like a studio. The door is up, the sun is low, and the panel you’ve just leveled with 2000-grit wet sanding is a uniform gray haze—deliberate, dense, and a little intimidating. At arm’s length the surface looks flat, but under a raking LED it blooms with tight linear tracks, the signature of controlled abrasion. This is the moment when confidence wavers: did you go too far, or not far enough? If you’ve ever paused and wondered how to erase that texture efficiently—without reintroducing waves, burning edges, or chasing your tail—this guide is for you.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/remove-2000-grit-sanding-scratches-efficiently-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/remove-2000-grit-sanding-scratches-efficiently-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/remove-2000-grit-sanding-scratches-efficiently-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/remove-2000-grit-sanding-scratches-efficiently-polishing-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/remove-2000-grit-sanding-scratches-efficiently-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/remove-2000-grit-sanding-scratches-efficiently-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/remove-2000-grit-sanding-scratches-efficiently-polishing-sandpaper/cards/instagram/remove-2000-grit-sanding-scratches-efficiently-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/remove-2000-grit-sanding-scratches-efficiently-polishing-sandpaper/cards/instagram/remove-2000-grit-sanding-scratches-efficiently-polishing-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/remove-2000-grit-sanding-scratches-efficiently-polishing-sandpaper/cards/instagram/remove-2000-grit-sanding-scratches-efficiently-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/remove-2000-grit-sanding-scratches-efficiently-polishing-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/remove-2000-grit-sanding-scratches-efficiently-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/remove-2000-grit-sanding-scratches-efficiently-polishing-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/remove-2000-grit-sanding-scratches-efficiently-polishing-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/remove-2000-grit-sanding-scratches-efficiently-polishing-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/remove-2000-grit-sanding-scratches-efficiently-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/remove-2000-grit-sanding-scratches-efficiently-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/remove-2000-grit-sanding-scratches-efficiently-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/remove-2000-grit-sanding-scratches-efficiently-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/remove-2000-grit-sanding-scratches-efficiently-polishing-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/remove-2000-grit-sanding-scratches-efficiently-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/remove-2000-grit-sanding-scratches-efficiently-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Identify Surface Rust Versus Scale And Perforation</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/identify-surface-rust-versus-scale-and-perforation-rust-repair/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/identify-surface-rust-versus-scale-and-perforation-rust-repair/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 05 Nov 2025 04:10:19 +0000</pubDate><category>Metal Polishing &amp; Rust Repair</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>rust removal</category><description>Engineer’s guide to identify surface rust, scale, and perforation, with testing methods, abrasives, and rust repair decisions for lasting results.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="rust-repair-spotting-surface-scale-and-perforation"&gt;Rust Repair: Spotting Surface, Scale, and Perforation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning light caught the fender of my old wagon just right, the way it sometimes does when you’re not quite awake and not quite rushing. A faint blister under the paint telegraphed something I’ve learned to notice: the subtle topography of oxidation. It’s the kind of moment most of us meet with a sigh and a glance away. I paused instead. As a product engineer who’s spent years testing abrasives, primers, and coatings, I’ve learned that the difference between a quick cosmetic tune-up and a structural failure starts with how we look at rust—and how early we decide to act on it. Whether you wrench on weekends or you’re planning a professional rust repair, the first step is classification. Is it only surface rust that can be abraded clean? Is it scale that has undermined the steel layers? Or is it perforation where oxygen and time have already won a hole through the sheet?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/identify-surface-rust-versus-scale-and-perforation-rust-repair/cards/facebook/identify-surface-rust-versus-scale-and-perforation-rust-repair.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/identify-surface-rust-versus-scale-and-perforation-rust-repair/cards/facebook/identify-surface-rust-versus-scale-and-perforation-rust-repair.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/identify-surface-rust-versus-scale-and-perforation-rust-repair/cards/facebook/identify-surface-rust-versus-scale-and-perforation-rust-repair.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/identify-surface-rust-versus-scale-and-perforation-rust-repair/cards/instagram/identify-surface-rust-versus-scale-and-perforation-rust-repair.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/identify-surface-rust-versus-scale-and-perforation-rust-repair/cards/instagram/identify-surface-rust-versus-scale-and-perforation-rust-repair.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/identify-surface-rust-versus-scale-and-perforation-rust-repair/cards/instagram/identify-surface-rust-versus-scale-and-perforation-rust-repair.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/identify-surface-rust-versus-scale-and-perforation-rust-repair/cards/pinterest/identify-surface-rust-versus-scale-and-perforation-rust-repair.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/identify-surface-rust-versus-scale-and-perforation-rust-repair/cards/pinterest/identify-surface-rust-versus-scale-and-perforation-rust-repair.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/identify-surface-rust-versus-scale-and-perforation-rust-repair/cards/pinterest/identify-surface-rust-versus-scale-and-perforation-rust-repair.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/identify-surface-rust-versus-scale-and-perforation-rust-repair/cards/facebook/identify-surface-rust-versus-scale-and-perforation-rust-repair.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/identify-surface-rust-versus-scale-and-perforation-rust-repair/cards/facebook/identify-surface-rust-versus-scale-and-perforation-rust-repair.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/identify-surface-rust-versus-scale-and-perforation-rust-repair/cards/facebook/identify-surface-rust-versus-scale-and-perforation-rust-repair.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Best Wet Sanding Sequence For Plastic Headlight Lenses</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 05 Nov 2025 03:51:43 +0000</pubDate><category>Headlight Restoration</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-1200</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-2500</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>A precise, technical guide to wet lens sanding for plastic headlights—abrasives, workflows, and UV protection to restore clear, durable optics.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="best-lens-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlights"&gt;Best Lens Sanding Sequence for Plastic Headlights&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twilight is the worst time to discover your headlights are lying to you. Streetlights smear into blurry halos; lane markers fade into a matte wash. You feel yourself leaning forward in the seat as if posture could coax more lumens from the housings. But the problem isn’t the bulb; it’s the lens. Polycarbonate oxidizes, turns porous, and grows a diffuse surface that scatters light instead of transmitting it. That’s fixable if you stop thinking of restoration as a wipe-on miracle and start treating it like precision surface engineering. This guide is about real lens sanding—structured, wet, and sequential—not guessing with a single pad until it “looks better.”&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding/cards/facebook/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding/cards/facebook/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding/cards/facebook/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding/cards/instagram/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding/cards/instagram/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding/cards/instagram/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding/cards/pinterest/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding/cards/pinterest/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding/cards/pinterest/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding/cards/facebook/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding/cards/facebook/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding/cards/facebook/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Crosshatch Sanding Pattern For Even Clear Coat Leveling</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 05 Nov 2025 00:59:26 +0000</pubDate><category>Wet Sanding Clear Coat</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-2500</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>clear coat</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>sanding block</category><description>Learn the crosshatch sanding pattern for even clear coat leveling—tools, grits, steps, and pro tips for a flat, glossy, mirror-like finish.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="crosshatch-sanding-for-clear-coat-leveling"&gt;Crosshatch Sanding for Clear Coat Leveling&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You notice it first when the sun dips behind a cloud. Your car—or maybe that guitar body you’ve been refinishing—looked perfect in full daylight. But now a soft, diffused glow reveals a faint orange peel, a sprinkling of swirls, and the slightest rippling along a contour line. It’s not ruined, but it’s not the glassy surface you had in mind. The promise of a flawless finish is what pulls many of us into the workshop on a Saturday morning, and it’s what makes techniques like clear coat leveling feel less like a chore and more like craftsmanship. What you need isn’t more product or a heavier hand; it’s a repeatable way to flatten texture without taking unnecessary risks.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling/cards/facebook/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling/cards/facebook/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling/cards/facebook/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling/cards/instagram/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling/cards/instagram/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling/cards/instagram/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling/cards/pinterest/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling/cards/pinterest/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling/cards/pinterest/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling/cards/facebook/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling/cards/facebook/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling/cards/facebook/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Polish Epoxy Resin To Glass Like Finish</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 21:00:08 +0000</pubDate><category>Resin Polishing</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-1500</category><description>Learn how to polish epoxy resin to a glass-like finish with step-by-step sanding, heat control, compounds, and pro tips for durable clarity.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="resin-polishing-for-a-glass-like-epoxy-finish"&gt;Resin Polishing for a Glass-Like Epoxy Finish&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first time you run a fingertip across an epoxy surface, it’s a little magic trick. The light catches, colors bloom, and you expect the kind of clarity you see on showroom glass. But if you’ve poured, leveled, and cured resin yourself, you also know the moment that follows: under sunlight or a raking lamp, faint haze, scratch patterns, or tiny undulations whisper that the job isn’t quite done. That’s where resonant craftsmanship meets patience—where resin polishing turns a good pour into a gleaming, glass-like finish.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing/cards/instagram/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing/cards/instagram/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing/cards/instagram/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing/cards/pinterest/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing/cards/pinterest/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing/cards/pinterest/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>14</readingTime></item><item><title>Soak Time For Wet Sanding Papers</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 19:47:57 +0000</pubDate><category>Waterproof &amp; Wet/Dry Paper</category><category>grit-280</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-1200</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>wet sanding</category><description>Learn the optimal soak times for wet dry sandpaper, how soaking affects abrasive performance, and precise workflows for wood, paint, and metal.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="wet-dry-sandpaper-soak-times-a-technical-guide"&gt;Wet Dry Sandpaper Soak Times: A Technical Guide&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shop is quiet except for the slow drip from a rinse bottle, pooling across a workbench where a clear-coated guitar body breathes under the lights. There’s a shallow tray of clean water, a few folded sheets of wet dry sandpaper, and a foam pad waiting like a promise. You press a fingertip to the lacquer—weeks of curing have left it hard, crisp, and unforgiving. You remember the last time you rushed the process and chased pigtails under a glaring shop light. Not today. Today, the water will do its work before the first stroke lands.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/instagram/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/instagram/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/instagram/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Difference Between Compounding And Polishing</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 02:16:29 +0000</pubDate><category>Polishing &amp; Finishing</category><category>mirror finish</category><category>polishing pads</category><category>grit progression</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-1200</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>clear coat</category><description>Learn the difference between compounding and polishing, how to choose polishing sandpaper and pads, and the step-by-step process for flawless finishes.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="compounding-vs-polishing-guide-to-polishing-sandpaper"&gt;Compounding vs Polishing: Guide to Polishing Sandpaper&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a moment every craftsperson recognizes: you step into the garage or studio, sunlight cuts across a painted panel or tabletop, and you see everything—swirls you never meant to leave, scratches that catch the light just so, a haze that dulls the color you spent hours applying. Your instinct might be to reach for the strongest product you own, but knowing the difference between compounding and polishing—and where polishing sandpaper fits—can save time, material, and the finish you’re trying to protect. Maybe it’s the clear coat on your daily driver, the lacquer on a guitar body, or the resin on a turned pen blank. Different surfaces, same goal: remove defects while preserving as much material as possible.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper/cards/instagram/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper/cards/instagram/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper/cards/instagram/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>How To Wet Sand Clear Coat Without Burning Through Edges</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/02/how-to-wet-sand-clear-coat-without-burning-through-edges-wet-sanding-clear-coat/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/02/how-to-wet-sand-clear-coat-without-burning-through-edges-wet-sanding-clear-coat/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 02 Nov 2025 23:14:03 +0000</pubDate><category>Wet Sanding Clear Coat</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>clear coat</category><category>sanding block</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Learn the art of wet sanding clear coat to achieve a flawless finish without burning through edges.

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stepping into your garage, the scent of fresh paint still lingers in the air, mingling with the familiar aroma of motor oil and sawdust. Your latest project—a classic car restoration—is nearing completion.

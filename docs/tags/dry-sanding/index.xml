&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning in the garage, the air smelled faintly of cut clear coat and soapy water. A half-finished motorcycle tank sat on a foam cradle, its orange peel and dust nibs highlighted by a raking LED panel. I’d already tried a few sheets of 1500 grit from a contractor pack, but they stalled after a few passes, loading with milky slurry and leaving stray scratches that would require more polish later. This is the moment that separates a casual sand from a dependable workflow—the point where abrasive choice dictates not just speed, but consistency and finish quality. Swapping to silicon carbide sandpaper felt like a small change, but it reset the process: faster leveling, more controllable scratch patterns, and fewer surprise defects.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/09.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/instagram/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/instagram/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/instagram/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Keep Surfaces Wet To Control Heat</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2025 13:37:28 +0000</pubDate><category>Glass &amp; Ceramics Sanding</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-280</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-1200</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>Learn expert glass sanding techniques—why water matters, how to control heat, avoid cracks, and get a flawless edge with safe, practical workshop setups.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="glass-sanding-keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat"&gt;Glass Sanding: Keep Surfaces Wet to Control Heat&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know that afternoon light that hits your workshop just right—sawdust floating like golden confetti, the radio low, a mug ring etched into the bench? That’s where precision starts for me. I remember the first time I tried to smooth a chipped glass shelf salvaged from a vintage cabinet. I treated it like hardwood: dry paper, firm pressure, and a “let’s get this done” pace. Ten minutes in, the edge flashed white, my pad squealed, and the glass pinged with that terrifying, crystalline chatter. I learned fast: glass doesn’t forgive heat. It stores stress the way steel stores spring.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/03.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding/cards/instagram/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding/cards/instagram/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding/cards/instagram/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding/cards/pinterest/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding/cards/pinterest/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding/cards/pinterest/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Reduced Heat And Loading On Tough Materials</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/16/reduced-heat-and-loading-on-tough-materials-ceramic-sanding-discs/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/16/reduced-heat-and-loading-on-tough-materials-ceramic-sanding-discs/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 16 Nov 2025 13:30:01 +0000</pubDate><category>Ceramic &amp; Premium Abrasives</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-180</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>Engineer-tested review of ceramic sanding discs—how they cut cooler, resist loading, and last longer on stainless, hardwoods, and composites.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="ceramic-sanding-discs-for-cooler-cleaner-cuts"&gt;Ceramic Sanding Discs for Cooler, Cleaner Cuts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Late on a Saturday, the garage hums like a small factory. The goal is modest—deburr a few stainless brackets, flatten a maple cutting board, and knock down drips on a fiberglass canoe repair—but the reality is a stack of spent discs, a hot sander, and surfaces that look worse with every pass. You can smell scorched wood and feel the sander dragging as the face clogs with resin and dust. The disc you just installed is already glazed. It’s the kind of session that makes you wonder if sanding is a test of patience rather than a controllable, measurable process.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/22.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/16/reduced-heat-and-loading-on-tough-materials-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/reduced-heat-and-loading-on-tough-materials-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/16/reduced-heat-and-loading-on-tough-materials-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/reduced-heat-and-loading-on-tough-materials-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/16/reduced-heat-and-loading-on-tough-materials-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/reduced-heat-and-loading-on-tough-materials-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/16/reduced-heat-and-loading-on-tough-materials-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/reduced-heat-and-loading-on-tough-materials-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/16/reduced-heat-and-loading-on-tough-materials-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/reduced-heat-and-loading-on-tough-materials-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/16/reduced-heat-and-loading-on-tough-materials-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/reduced-heat-and-loading-on-tough-materials-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/16/reduced-heat-and-loading-on-tough-materials-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/reduced-heat-and-loading-on-tough-materials-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/16/reduced-heat-and-loading-on-tough-materials-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/reduced-heat-and-loading-on-tough-materials-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/16/reduced-heat-and-loading-on-tough-materials-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/reduced-heat-and-loading-on-tough-materials-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/16/reduced-heat-and-loading-on-tough-materials-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/reduced-heat-and-loading-on-tough-materials-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/16/reduced-heat-and-loading-on-tough-materials-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/reduced-heat-and-loading-on-tough-materials-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/16/reduced-heat-and-loading-on-tough-materials-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/reduced-heat-and-loading-on-tough-materials-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Replace Triangle Sheets Cleanly And Quickly</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/replace-triangle-sheets-cleanly-and-quickly-detail-sander-sheets/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/replace-triangle-sheets-cleanly-and-quickly-detail-sander-sheets/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 13:38:22 +0000</pubDate><category>Detail Sander Sheets</category><category>grit-220</category><category>dust control</category><category>grit progression</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>Learn how to replace triangular detail sander sheets quickly and cleanly with pro tips on fit, dust control, and pad care for smooth, precise results.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="how-to-swap-detail-sander-sheets-fast-and-clean"&gt;How to Swap Detail Sander Sheets Fast and Clean&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The moment always arrives at the worst time—on a stubborn corner where paint gathers like drifts of snow, and your sander starts to hiss instead of bite. You glance down: the grit is glazed, the tip is frayed, and your pace stalls. Swapping detail sander sheets should be quick and clean, but if you’re peeling at the edges, misaligning dust holes, or leaving residue on the pad, it becomes the dreaded task that derails flow. Whether you’re reviving an old window sash, smoothing a toy chest lid, or easing a cabinet door into a perfect close, that triangular sheet is the tiny workhorse that makes sharp edges and tight spaces feel easy—if you manage it well.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/02.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/replace-triangle-sheets-cleanly-and-quickly-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/replace-triangle-sheets-cleanly-and-quickly-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/replace-triangle-sheets-cleanly-and-quickly-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/replace-triangle-sheets-cleanly-and-quickly-detail-sander-sheets.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/replace-triangle-sheets-cleanly-and-quickly-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/replace-triangle-sheets-cleanly-and-quickly-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/replace-triangle-sheets-cleanly-and-quickly-detail-sander-sheets/cards/instagram/replace-triangle-sheets-cleanly-and-quickly-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/replace-triangle-sheets-cleanly-and-quickly-detail-sander-sheets/cards/instagram/replace-triangle-sheets-cleanly-and-quickly-detail-sander-sheets.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/replace-triangle-sheets-cleanly-and-quickly-detail-sander-sheets/cards/instagram/replace-triangle-sheets-cleanly-and-quickly-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/replace-triangle-sheets-cleanly-and-quickly-detail-sander-sheets/cards/pinterest/replace-triangle-sheets-cleanly-and-quickly-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/replace-triangle-sheets-cleanly-and-quickly-detail-sander-sheets/cards/pinterest/replace-triangle-sheets-cleanly-and-quickly-detail-sander-sheets.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/replace-triangle-sheets-cleanly-and-quickly-detail-sander-sheets/cards/pinterest/replace-triangle-sheets-cleanly-and-quickly-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/replace-triangle-sheets-cleanly-and-quickly-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/replace-triangle-sheets-cleanly-and-quickly-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/replace-triangle-sheets-cleanly-and-quickly-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/replace-triangle-sheets-cleanly-and-quickly-detail-sander-sheets.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/replace-triangle-sheets-cleanly-and-quickly-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/replace-triangle-sheets-cleanly-and-quickly-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Moisture And Acclimation Checks Before Floor Sanding</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/moisture-and-acclimation-checks-before-floor-sanding-wood-floor-prep/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/moisture-and-acclimation-checks-before-floor-sanding-wood-floor-prep/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2025 21:54:27 +0000</pubDate><category>Floor &amp; Deck Sanding</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-220</category><category>dry sanding</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Moisture and acclimation checks for wood floor prep.

&lt;p&gt;The first time I heard a moisture meter beep in an empty living room, I knew my weekend “quick sand and coat” wasn’t going to be quick at all. Sunlight was warming the boards by the patio door, the HVAC was off to save a few bucks, and the floor felt flat. But wood doesn’t ask how it feels—it tells you through movement. That morning, I leaned on the handle of my drum sander and thought about the real beginning of any wood floor prep: knowing where the moisture sits, where it’s heading, and whether the room’s climate matches the life the floor will live after you’re done. If you’ve ever watched stain turn blotchy, or a new finish develop white lines at board edges, you’ve met moisture the hard way.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/13.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/moisture-and-acclimation-checks-before-floor-sanding-wood-floor-prep/cards/facebook/moisture-and-acclimation-checks-before-floor-sanding-wood-floor-prep.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/moisture-and-acclimation-checks-before-floor-sanding-wood-floor-prep/cards/facebook/moisture-and-acclimation-checks-before-floor-sanding-wood-floor-prep.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/moisture-and-acclimation-checks-before-floor-sanding-wood-floor-prep/cards/facebook/moisture-and-acclimation-checks-before-floor-sanding-wood-floor-prep.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/moisture-and-acclimation-checks-before-floor-sanding-wood-floor-prep/cards/instagram/moisture-and-acclimation-checks-before-floor-sanding-wood-floor-prep.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/moisture-and-acclimation-checks-before-floor-sanding-wood-floor-prep/cards/instagram/moisture-and-acclimation-checks-before-floor-sanding-wood-floor-prep.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/moisture-and-acclimation-checks-before-floor-sanding-wood-floor-prep/cards/instagram/moisture-and-acclimation-checks-before-floor-sanding-wood-floor-prep.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/moisture-and-acclimation-checks-before-floor-sanding-wood-floor-prep/cards/pinterest/moisture-and-acclimation-checks-before-floor-sanding-wood-floor-prep.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/moisture-and-acclimation-checks-before-floor-sanding-wood-floor-prep/cards/pinterest/moisture-and-acclimation-checks-before-floor-sanding-wood-floor-prep.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/moisture-and-acclimation-checks-before-floor-sanding-wood-floor-prep/cards/pinterest/moisture-and-acclimation-checks-before-floor-sanding-wood-floor-prep.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/moisture-and-acclimation-checks-before-floor-sanding-wood-floor-prep/cards/facebook/moisture-and-acclimation-checks-before-floor-sanding-wood-floor-prep.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/moisture-and-acclimation-checks-before-floor-sanding-wood-floor-prep/cards/facebook/moisture-and-acclimation-checks-before-floor-sanding-wood-floor-prep.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/moisture-and-acclimation-checks-before-floor-sanding-wood-floor-prep/cards/facebook/moisture-and-acclimation-checks-before-floor-sanding-wood-floor-prep.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Dust Reduction Strategies During Sanding</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/09/dust-reduction-strategies-during-sanding-eco-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/09/dust-reduction-strategies-during-sanding-eco-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 09 Nov 2025 13:28:15 +0000</pubDate><category>Eco &amp; Non-Toxic Abrasives</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-400</category><category>dust control</category><category>dry sanding</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Cut dust at the source with smart sanding tactics, from vacuums and eco sandpaper to room containment and cleanup.

&lt;p&gt;The first time you notice sanding dust is rarely at the tool. It’s later—when the afternoon light cuts across the room and reveals a fine, floating galaxy you didn’t know you’d made. It settles on window sills and picture frames, drifts into the next room, and somehow finds its way into the keyboard you swear you covered. If you’re working in a small shop or a spare bedroom, those particles don’t just make a mess; they linger in the air you breathe, polish themselves into a film on every surface, and complicate the finish you apply next. It’s a familiar scene to anyone who’s refinished a table, resurfaced a stair tread, or prepped cabinet doors on a weekend. The surprise is not how fast dust spreads—it’s how persistent it is once you let it escape.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/09/dust-reduction-strategies-during-sanding-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/dust-reduction-strategies-during-sanding-eco-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/09/dust-reduction-strategies-during-sanding-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/dust-reduction-strategies-during-sanding-eco-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/09/dust-reduction-strategies-during-sanding-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/dust-reduction-strategies-during-sanding-eco-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/09/dust-reduction-strategies-during-sanding-eco-sandpaper/cards/instagram/dust-reduction-strategies-during-sanding-eco-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/09/dust-reduction-strategies-during-sanding-eco-sandpaper/cards/instagram/dust-reduction-strategies-during-sanding-eco-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/09/dust-reduction-strategies-during-sanding-eco-sandpaper/cards/instagram/dust-reduction-strategies-during-sanding-eco-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/09/dust-reduction-strategies-during-sanding-eco-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/dust-reduction-strategies-during-sanding-eco-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/09/dust-reduction-strategies-during-sanding-eco-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/dust-reduction-strategies-during-sanding-eco-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/09/dust-reduction-strategies-during-sanding-eco-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/dust-reduction-strategies-during-sanding-eco-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/09/dust-reduction-strategies-during-sanding-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/dust-reduction-strategies-during-sanding-eco-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/09/dust-reduction-strategies-during-sanding-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/dust-reduction-strategies-during-sanding-eco-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/09/dust-reduction-strategies-during-sanding-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/dust-reduction-strategies-during-sanding-eco-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Film Backing For Uniform Fine Scratches</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 08 Nov 2025 13:28:53 +0000</pubDate><category>Backing Types &amp; Coatings</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>orbital sander</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>Engineer-tested guidance on film-backed, open coat sandpaper for uniform fine scratches, with data, setups, and grit sequencing tips.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="open-coat-sandpaper-on-film-for-fine-scratches"&gt;Open coat sandpaper on film for fine scratches&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The raking light told the truth I didn’t want to hear. After an hour shaping a walnut desktop, the surface looked perfect under diffuse shop lights—but the morning sun found every swirl and pigtail. I’d sanded carefully, stepped through grits, and kept the pad moving. Still, the micro-scratches telegraphed through as soon as I wiped on mineral spirits. That’s the moment I switched to film-backed abrasives and, crucially, open coat sandpaper for the early and mid-grits. The difference wasn’t subtle; it was measurable.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/instagram/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/instagram/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/instagram/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Wet Sanding To Control Marine Dust</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 08 Nov 2025 00:54:10 +0000</pubDate><category>Marine Sanding</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>orbital sander</category><category>dry sanding</category><category>sanding block</category><category>mirror finish</category><description>Learn wet boat sanding to cut toxic dust, protect waterways, and prep your hull right.

&lt;p&gt;There’s a particular quiet to the yard before sunrise. The halyards ping, the coffee steams in a chipped thermos, and the hull you’ve been avoiding stands there like a promise you can’t put off. I’ve been on both sides of that moment—rushing, dusty, and regretting shortcuts later—and the method that changed the game for me was wet boat sanding. Not because it’s pretty, but because it’s efficient, safer for your lungs, and easier to keep the neighbors and the yard manager happy. You control the mess. You protect the water you love. And you end the day with a hull that’s flatter, cooler, and ready to bond.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding/cards/instagram/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding/cards/instagram/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding/cards/instagram/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding/cards/pinterest/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding/cards/pinterest/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding/cards/pinterest/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Progressive Micron Steps For Clarity</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 08 Nov 2025 00:41:16 +0000</pubDate><category>Glass &amp; Ceramics Sanding</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-500</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>Engineer-tested guide to glass sanding using progressive micron steps for optical clarity, with media choices, wet technique, and polishing workflow.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="glass-sanding-progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity"&gt;Glass Sanding: Progressive Micron Steps for Clarity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You notice it first at breakfast—the way the morning light breaks into a haze across your coffee table. A scratch the length of a paperclip sits dead center, scattering highlights into a milky halo that wasn’t there last week. You run a fingernail across it. The catch is slight, but it’s there. It’s the same story with a watch crystal that met a brick wall one hurried afternoon, or a window panel that’s accumulated fine swirls from years of cleaning. Replacing glass is one option, but it’s expensive, wasteful, and impractical for built-ins. As a product engineer who spends an unreasonable amount of time testing abrasives, I prefer another route: controlled, progressive glass sanding that restores optical clarity rather than hides damage.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding/cards/instagram/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding/cards/instagram/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding/cards/instagram/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding/cards/pinterest/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding/cards/pinterest/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding/cards/pinterest/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Let Epoxy Cure Fully Before Sanding</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 07 Nov 2025 16:25:05 +0000</pubDate><category>Plastic &amp; Epoxy Sanding</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-360</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit progression</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>Learn why letting epoxy fully cure before sanding is essential, plus timelines, tests, grit progressions, and pro tips for flawless, clear finishes.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="epoxy-sanding-why-waiting-to-cure-pays-off"&gt;Epoxy Sanding: Why Waiting to Cure Pays Off&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a point in every resin project when anticipation and restraint collide. You’ve de‑molded a river board you poured last weekend or set down a glossy flood coat on a tabletop, and the surface is whispering promises of glass-like clarity. You picture the final reveal: the light catching the grain, the resin depth turning everyday moments into a small ceremony. You also see the last mile between what is and what could be—the smoothing, refining, and polishing phase—also known as epoxy sanding. Your hands ache to pick up the sander. But this is where patience protects your craftsmanship.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding/cards/instagram/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding/cards/instagram/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding/cards/instagram/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding/cards/pinterest/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding/cards/pinterest/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding/cards/pinterest/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Choose Hose Diameter For Best Suction</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 06 Nov 2025 14:24:00 +0000</pubDate><category>Dust Extraction Systems</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>dry sanding</category><category>orbital sander</category><category>sanding block</category><category>joint compound</category><description>An engineer’s guide to hose diameter for dustless sanding—get the best suction, cleaner air, and faster finishing with data-driven choices.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="dustless-sanding-pick-the-right-hose-diameter"&gt;Dustless Sanding: Pick the Right Hose Diameter&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first time I tried to sand a maple tabletop in my small garage, I didn’t plan for the dust. Within minutes, a visible cloud hovered over my workbench, the air had that chalky taste, and the light from the door turned into a foggy beam. The sander did its job, but the shop felt uninhabitable. Fast-forward to today, and my setup looks completely different: a quiet extractor hums under the bench, a smooth-bore hose clips into a sander with a snug port connection, and the cleanup is mostly emptying a bag. The shift to dustless sanding wasn’t just about comfort—it was about control. Once you understand how hose diameter, hose length, and vacuum performance interact, you can tune a system that captures chips and submicron dust instead of aerosolizing it.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding/cards/facebook/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding/cards/facebook/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding/cards/facebook/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding/cards/instagram/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding/cards/instagram/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding/cards/instagram/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding/cards/pinterest/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding/cards/pinterest/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding/cards/pinterest/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding/cards/facebook/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding/cards/facebook/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding/cards/facebook/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Psa Versus Hook And Loop Sanding Use Cases</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/psa-versus-hook-and-loop-sanding-use-cases-psa-sanding-discs/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/psa-versus-hook-and-loop-sanding-use-cases-psa-sanding-discs/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 06 Nov 2025 00:31:33 +0000</pubDate><category>PSA Discs</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-220</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>Compare PSA vs hook and loop sanding discs to choose the right system.

&lt;p&gt;Saturday light spills across your bench. The coffee’s gone cool, but your focus is warm and steady. You’re halfway through a maple tabletop—the kind of project where each pass of the sander either reveals depth and clarity or buries it under tiny scratches you’ll chase for hours. You pause with a fresh disc in your hand, the choice still nagging: pressure-sensitive adhesive (PSA) or hook and loop. You’ve heard the arguments in every shop and forum. PSA sanding discs promise the firmest connection and dead-flat contact; hook and loop offers quick swaps and forgiving feel across curves and edges. Today, it isn’t about brand loyalty. It’s about getting this surface right the first time.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/psa-versus-hook-and-loop-sanding-use-cases-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/psa-versus-hook-and-loop-sanding-use-cases-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/psa-versus-hook-and-loop-sanding-use-cases-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/psa-versus-hook-and-loop-sanding-use-cases-psa-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/psa-versus-hook-and-loop-sanding-use-cases-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/psa-versus-hook-and-loop-sanding-use-cases-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/psa-versus-hook-and-loop-sanding-use-cases-psa-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/psa-versus-hook-and-loop-sanding-use-cases-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/psa-versus-hook-and-loop-sanding-use-cases-psa-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/psa-versus-hook-and-loop-sanding-use-cases-psa-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/psa-versus-hook-and-loop-sanding-use-cases-psa-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/psa-versus-hook-and-loop-sanding-use-cases-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/psa-versus-hook-and-loop-sanding-use-cases-psa-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/psa-versus-hook-and-loop-sanding-use-cases-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/psa-versus-hook-and-loop-sanding-use-cases-psa-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/psa-versus-hook-and-loop-sanding-use-cases-psa-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/psa-versus-hook-and-loop-sanding-use-cases-psa-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/psa-versus-hook-and-loop-sanding-use-cases-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/psa-versus-hook-and-loop-sanding-use-cases-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/psa-versus-hook-and-loop-sanding-use-cases-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/psa-versus-hook-and-loop-sanding-use-cases-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/psa-versus-hook-and-loop-sanding-use-cases-psa-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/psa-versus-hook-and-loop-sanding-use-cases-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/psa-versus-hook-and-loop-sanding-use-cases-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Track And Tension Sanding Belts Properly</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/track-and-tension-sanding-belts-properly-sanding-belts/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/track-and-tension-sanding-belts-properly-sanding-belts/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 05 Nov 2025 18:06:04 +0000</pubDate><category>Sanding Belts &amp; Machines</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-150</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>Engineer-tested methods to track and tension sanding belts for stable cuts, longer life, and better finishes—plus diagnostics, calibration, and material</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="how-to-track-and-tension-sanding-belts-right"&gt;How to Track and Tension Sanding Belts Right&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still remember the first time a belt sander reminded me who’s boss. I was flattening a salvaged maple countertop in a cold garage, heater humming, coffee cooling. The sander sounded healthy at idle, but as soon as I leaned into it, the belt crept right, kissed the guard, and started singing. Within thirty seconds, grains glazed over on one edge, dust plumed unevenly, and the finish was streaky. I backed off, re-centered, nudged the tracking knob a hair, and tried again. Same result—only now the seam thumped every revolution. The culprit wasn’t just a “bad belt.” It was a bad setup: improper tension and unstable tracking.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/track-and-tension-sanding-belts-properly-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/track-and-tension-sanding-belts-properly-sanding-belts.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/track-and-tension-sanding-belts-properly-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/track-and-tension-sanding-belts-properly-sanding-belts.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/track-and-tension-sanding-belts-properly-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/track-and-tension-sanding-belts-properly-sanding-belts.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/track-and-tension-sanding-belts-properly-sanding-belts/cards/instagram/track-and-tension-sanding-belts-properly-sanding-belts.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/track-and-tension-sanding-belts-properly-sanding-belts/cards/instagram/track-and-tension-sanding-belts-properly-sanding-belts.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/track-and-tension-sanding-belts-properly-sanding-belts/cards/instagram/track-and-tension-sanding-belts-properly-sanding-belts.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/track-and-tension-sanding-belts-properly-sanding-belts/cards/pinterest/track-and-tension-sanding-belts-properly-sanding-belts.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/track-and-tension-sanding-belts-properly-sanding-belts/cards/pinterest/track-and-tension-sanding-belts-properly-sanding-belts.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/track-and-tension-sanding-belts-properly-sanding-belts/cards/pinterest/track-and-tension-sanding-belts-properly-sanding-belts.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/track-and-tension-sanding-belts-properly-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/track-and-tension-sanding-belts-properly-sanding-belts.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/track-and-tension-sanding-belts-properly-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/track-and-tension-sanding-belts-properly-sanding-belts.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/track-and-tension-sanding-belts-properly-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/track-and-tension-sanding-belts-properly-sanding-belts.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Best Grit For Sanding Between Coats Of Polyurethane</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 05 Nov 2025 04:59:16 +0000</pubDate><category>Between-Coats Sanding</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>dry sanding</category><category>clear coat</category><category>sanding block</category><description>Learn the best grit for sanding between coats of polyurethane, when to sand, and how to get a flawless, dust-free finish with pro-tested techniques.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="between-coats-sanding-best-grit-for-polyurethane"&gt;Between Coats Sanding: Best Grit for Polyurethane&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first time you run your hand across a newly finished table and feel the faint drag of tiny dust nibs, you understand why the small steps matter. Maybe it’s a maple dining top you’ve been nursing through long evenings, or a simple pine shelf that somehow carries outsized meaning. You’ve brushed on a smooth coat, waited patiently, and yet—under a raking light—tiny specks wink back at you like a constellation you didn’t intend to draw. That’s the moment when many projects turn from “good enough” to “I want this perfect.” And the bridge to perfect is almost always between coats sanding.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding/cards/instagram/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding/cards/instagram/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding/cards/instagram/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding/cards/pinterest/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding/cards/pinterest/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding/cards/pinterest/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Best Wet Sanding Sequence For Plastic Headlight Lenses</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 05 Nov 2025 03:51:43 +0000</pubDate><category>Headlight Restoration</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-1200</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-2500</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>A precise, technical guide to wet lens sanding for plastic headlights—abrasives, workflows, and UV protection to restore clear, durable optics.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="best-lens-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlights"&gt;Best Lens Sanding Sequence for Plastic Headlights&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twilight is the worst time to discover your headlights are lying to you. Streetlights smear into blurry halos; lane markers fade into a matte wash. You feel yourself leaning forward in the seat as if posture could coax more lumens from the housings. But the problem isn’t the bulb; it’s the lens. Polycarbonate oxidizes, turns porous, and grows a diffuse surface that scatters light instead of transmitting it. That’s fixable if you stop thinking of restoration as a wipe-on miracle and start treating it like precision surface engineering. This guide is about real lens sanding—structured, wet, and sequential—not guessing with a single pad until it “looks better.”&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding/cards/facebook/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding/cards/facebook/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding/cards/facebook/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding/cards/instagram/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding/cards/instagram/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding/cards/instagram/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding/cards/pinterest/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding/cards/pinterest/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding/cards/pinterest/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding/cards/facebook/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding/cards/facebook/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding/cards/facebook/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>How To Sand Wood By Hand For Smooth Finish</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 04 Nov 2025 03:41:00 +0000</pubDate><category>Hand Sanding Techniques</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>sanding block</category><category>grit progression</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>Learn hand sanding techniques, grit progression, and pro tips to achieve a flawless smooth wood finish with clear steps, tools, and troubleshooting.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="hand-sanding-for-a-glass-smooth-wood-finish"&gt;Hand sanding for a glass-smooth wood finish&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a quiet Saturday morning, the house is still enough to hear the tiny rasp of paper against wood. Sunlight falls across the table you’ve promised to restore—the one that’s been gathering keys, grocery bags, and happy-hour mail for years. At first glance, it seems fine. But run your fingertips from the center to the edge and you can feel a map of dents, glue drips, and faint chatter lines left by the last sander. This is where patience matters.

&lt;p&gt;On a quiet Saturday afternoon, you clamp down the last door of that heirloom dresser you’ve been restoring. The grain finally shows through the old varnish, but the surface still isn’t the mirror-smooth finish you pictured. You reach for a fresh sheet, feel the grit with your thumb, and hesitate—this is where the choice between silicon carbide sandpaper and aluminum oxide decides whether you’ll spend the evening admiring your work or chasing scratches you didn’t mean to make. Maybe you’re here because a paint finish went cloudy after dry sanding, or a clear coat took a hopscotch of swirls under shop lights. Or maybe your belt sander chewed through hook-and-loop discs like a wood chipper and you need something tougher and more predictable.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/instagram/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/instagram/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/instagram/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>13</readingTime></item><item><title>Sand Gelcoat Before Repairs Or Coating</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/sand-gelcoat-before-repairs-or-coating-boat-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/sand-gelcoat-before-repairs-or-coating-boat-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 23:56:18 +0000</pubDate><category>Marine Sanding</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-280</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-600</category><category>dry sanding</category><category>dust control</category><category>wet sanding</category><description>Engineer-tested guide to boat sanding gelcoat for repairs or recoating: grits, tools, wet vs dry, adhesion science, and step-by-step prep.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="boat-sanding-for-gelcoat-repairs-prep-and-technique"&gt;Boat sanding for gelcoat repairs: prep and technique&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The morning wind riffles the marina flags as you step onto the dock with a sander in one hand and masking tape in the other. Yesterday’s chop left salt crystals on the rails; last season left a constellation of nicks in the gelcoat, a chalky haze along the topsides, and the faint outline of old repairs. It’s tempting to rush straight to coating—one more layer to hide the blemishes—but that only traps problems under gloss. The difference between a repair that lasts one season and one that lasts a decade starts long before the roller hits the pan. It starts with boat sanding done with intention.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/sand-gelcoat-before-repairs-or-coating-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/sand-gelcoat-before-repairs-or-coating-boat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/sand-gelcoat-before-repairs-or-coating-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/sand-gelcoat-before-repairs-or-coating-boat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/sand-gelcoat-before-repairs-or-coating-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/sand-gelcoat-before-repairs-or-coating-boat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/sand-gelcoat-before-repairs-or-coating-boat-sanding/cards/instagram/sand-gelcoat-before-repairs-or-coating-boat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/sand-gelcoat-before-repairs-or-coating-boat-sanding/cards/instagram/sand-gelcoat-before-repairs-or-coating-boat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/sand-gelcoat-before-repairs-or-coating-boat-sanding/cards/instagram/sand-gelcoat-before-repairs-or-coating-boat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/sand-gelcoat-before-repairs-or-coating-boat-sanding/cards/pinterest/sand-gelcoat-before-repairs-or-coating-boat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/sand-gelcoat-before-repairs-or-coating-boat-sanding/cards/pinterest/sand-gelcoat-before-repairs-or-coating-boat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/sand-gelcoat-before-repairs-or-coating-boat-sanding/cards/pinterest/sand-gelcoat-before-repairs-or-coating-boat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/sand-gelcoat-before-repairs-or-coating-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/sand-gelcoat-before-repairs-or-coating-boat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/sand-gelcoat-before-repairs-or-coating-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/sand-gelcoat-before-repairs-or-coating-boat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/sand-gelcoat-before-repairs-or-coating-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/sand-gelcoat-before-repairs-or-coating-boat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Avoid Loading With Stearated Papers</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 20:47:55 +0000</pubDate><category>Plastic &amp; Epoxy Sanding</category><category>grit-280</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>dust control</category><category>grit progression</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>Master epoxy sanding without clogging.

&lt;p&gt;You know the moment: the shop is quiet, the resin river table catches morning light, and all you can see are tiny ridges, dust nibs, and a faint orange peel across that once-glassy pour. This is where projects are made—or marred. Epoxy sanding isn’t glamorous, but it’s the step that decides if your final finish looks like a mirror or a fogged window. And if you’ve ever had sandpaper load up in seconds, smear epoxy into gummy streaks, or clog your discs so fast you start doubting your gear, you’re not alone. I’ve been there—hands on the sander, vac humming, wondering why the surface keeps fighting back.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding/cards/instagram/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding/cards/instagram/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding/cards/instagram/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding/cards/pinterest/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding/cards/pinterest/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding/cards/pinterest/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>When Ceramic Outperforms Aluminum Oxide</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 13:34:14 +0000</pubDate><category>Ceramic &amp; Premium Abrasives</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-180</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>dry sanding</category><category>clear coat</category><category>orbital sander</category><category>dust control</category><description>Learn when ceramic sanding discs beat aluminum oxide: cut rate, heat control, cost per part, and pro tips for metal, wood, and composites.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="when-ceramic-sanding-discs-outperform-aluminum-oxide"&gt;When Ceramic Sanding Discs Outperform Aluminum Oxide&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a quiet Saturday morning, the garage becomes your studio. You’ve cleared a workbench, lined up clamps and rags, and lit the space with a warm shop lamp. The project is personal: a welded steel coffee table for the living room, something sturdy and simple that can hold the weight of everyday life. The first passes with a grinder feel hopeful—until the discs start glazing. Heat builds, paint smears, and the cut slows to a crawl. You switch to a finer grit, then back again, but the aluminum oxide discs keep dulling, forcing you to lean harder. The surface looks scuffed but not flat, and your shoulders ache from forcing the tool to do what the abrasive simply won’t.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Best Grit Sponges For Trim And Profiles</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/best-grit-sponges-for-trim-and-profiles-sanding-sponge/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/best-grit-sponges-for-trim-and-profiles-sanding-sponge/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 03:21:23 +0000</pubDate><category>Sanding Sponges</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-600</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>Find the best sanding sponge grits for trim and profiles.

&lt;p&gt;The first time you notice your trim is when it looks wrong. It might be the sunlight clipping across a paneled door at mid-morning, suddenly revealing raised brush lines, tiny dust nibs, and a few mystery divots at the chair rail. Or maybe it’s the crown molding you’ve always loved, now dulled by a hundred handprints and the quiet scrapes of a step ladder. That’s the moment: when care meets craft. You want your woodwork to feel clean and precise, to show off the curves and profiles rather than the flaws. And that’s when a simple, overlooked tool quietly becomes essential—the sanding sponge.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/best-grit-sponges-for-trim-and-profiles-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/best-grit-sponges-for-trim-and-profiles-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/best-grit-sponges-for-trim-and-profiles-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/best-grit-sponges-for-trim-and-profiles-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/best-grit-sponges-for-trim-and-profiles-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/best-grit-sponges-for-trim-and-profiles-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/best-grit-sponges-for-trim-and-profiles-sanding-sponge/cards/instagram/best-grit-sponges-for-trim-and-profiles-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/best-grit-sponges-for-trim-and-profiles-sanding-sponge/cards/instagram/best-grit-sponges-for-trim-and-profiles-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/best-grit-sponges-for-trim-and-profiles-sanding-sponge/cards/instagram/best-grit-sponges-for-trim-and-profiles-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/best-grit-sponges-for-trim-and-profiles-sanding-sponge/cards/pinterest/best-grit-sponges-for-trim-and-profiles-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/best-grit-sponges-for-trim-and-profiles-sanding-sponge/cards/pinterest/best-grit-sponges-for-trim-and-profiles-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/best-grit-sponges-for-trim-and-profiles-sanding-sponge/cards/pinterest/best-grit-sponges-for-trim-and-profiles-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/best-grit-sponges-for-trim-and-profiles-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/best-grit-sponges-for-trim-and-profiles-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/best-grit-sponges-for-trim-and-profiles-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/best-grit-sponges-for-trim-and-profiles-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/best-grit-sponges-for-trim-and-profiles-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/best-grit-sponges-for-trim-and-profiles-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>When To Use Sanding Blocks Versus Bare Hand</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 02:57:35 +0000</pubDate><category>Sanding Blocks</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>sanding block</category><category>dry sanding</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Learn when to use a sanding block versus bare-hand sanding for flawless finishes.

&lt;p&gt;The first pass of the evening always tells you how the job will go. You clamp a pine shelf to the bench, switch on the task light, and run your fingertips across a coat of primer that’s not quite right—dust nibs, a few raised grain lines, a ridge where you filled a knot. The shop is quiet except for the small rasp of paper as you tear a new sheet. You think about reaching for your trusty sanding block, the one that’s squared a hundred edges and leveled just as many fills. Then you pause. The shelf has a soft, rounded front, and you can feel a subtle dip near the corner. A hard block might flatten more than you want. Your bare hand, wrapped around a fold of 320-grit, could trace the curve and polish it without flattening the profile. This is the moment that separates a good finish from a great one: choosing the right sanding approach for the surface in front of you.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block/cards/facebook/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block/cards/facebook/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block/cards/facebook/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block/cards/instagram/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block/cards/instagram/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block/cards/instagram/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block/cards/facebook/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block/cards/facebook/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block/cards/facebook/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>13</readingTime></item><item><title>Prevent Swirl Marks With Random Orbital Sanders</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 02:33:16 +0000</pubDate><category>Random Orbital Sanding</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-800</category><category>dust control</category><category>grit progression</category><category>dry sanding</category><category>clear coat</category><category>orbital sander</category><description>Learn expert workflows to eliminate swirl marks with random orbital sanding—covering surface prep, abrasives, dust control, and inspection.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanding"&gt;Prevent Swirl Marks with Random Orbital Sanding&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning, low sun at the window, the first coat of finish flashes across the panel you’ve been nursing all week. The figure in the oak wakes up, but so do faint halos you didn’t see under shop lights. Swirl marks. You tilt the board, squint, and realize you were moments from locking those defects under a film for good. It’s a gut-punch that most woodworkers and finish carpenters eventually feel. The culprit is rarely the tool itself; it’s the stack of process decisions that lead to one outcome or the other. The relief is that processes are controllable, and with random orbital sanding done deliberately, swirls are optional.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding/cards/instagram/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding/cards/instagram/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding/cards/instagram/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding/cards/pinterest/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding/cards/pinterest/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding/cards/pinterest/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>13</readingTime></item></channel></rss>

&lt;p&gt;The day starts cool, but the shop heats fast. You tape off a panel and power up the 5&amp;quot; random orbital. Within minutes, the disc is skating, resin smears streak the surface, and the pad feels hot enough to warp a finger pad. The clock is merciless. This is the moment where small choices—grain chemistry, topcoat, vacuum pattern—decide whether you flow into primer by lunch or spend the afternoon digging spent discs out of a bin. Heat and loading aren’t just nuisances; they are the leading indicators that your abrasives and process aren’t matched to the substrate, the geometry, or the dust load. That’s exactly where disciplined abrasive testing earns its keep: quantifying cut rates, temperature, and load-up so you can select coatings that stay cool and resist clogging right up to the finishing pass.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/07.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/10/coating-tech-to-reduce-heat-and-clogging-abrasive-testing/cards/facebook/coating-tech-to-reduce-heat-and-clogging-abrasive-testing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/10/coating-tech-to-reduce-heat-and-clogging-abrasive-testing/cards/facebook/coating-tech-to-reduce-heat-and-clogging-abrasive-testing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/10/coating-tech-to-reduce-heat-and-clogging-abrasive-testing/cards/facebook/coating-tech-to-reduce-heat-and-clogging-abrasive-testing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/10/coating-tech-to-reduce-heat-and-clogging-abrasive-testing/cards/instagram/coating-tech-to-reduce-heat-and-clogging-abrasive-testing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/10/coating-tech-to-reduce-heat-and-clogging-abrasive-testing/cards/instagram/coating-tech-to-reduce-heat-and-clogging-abrasive-testing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/10/coating-tech-to-reduce-heat-and-clogging-abrasive-testing/cards/instagram/coating-tech-to-reduce-heat-and-clogging-abrasive-testing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/10/coating-tech-to-reduce-heat-and-clogging-abrasive-testing/cards/pinterest/coating-tech-to-reduce-heat-and-clogging-abrasive-testing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/10/coating-tech-to-reduce-heat-and-clogging-abrasive-testing/cards/pinterest/coating-tech-to-reduce-heat-and-clogging-abrasive-testing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/10/coating-tech-to-reduce-heat-and-clogging-abrasive-testing/cards/pinterest/coating-tech-to-reduce-heat-and-clogging-abrasive-testing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/10/coating-tech-to-reduce-heat-and-clogging-abrasive-testing/cards/facebook/coating-tech-to-reduce-heat-and-clogging-abrasive-testing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/10/coating-tech-to-reduce-heat-and-clogging-abrasive-testing/cards/facebook/coating-tech-to-reduce-heat-and-clogging-abrasive-testing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/10/coating-tech-to-reduce-heat-and-clogging-abrasive-testing/cards/facebook/coating-tech-to-reduce-heat-and-clogging-abrasive-testing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>How To Sand Old Paint Without Gouging The Substrate</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/28/how-to-sand-old-paint-without-gouging-the-substrate-paint-removal-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/28/how-to-sand-old-paint-without-gouging-the-substrate-paint-removal-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2025 13:35:01 +0000</pubDate><category>Paint Removal &amp; Surface Prep</category><category>paint prep</category><category>rust removal</category><category>primer coat</category><category>sanding block</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>dust control</category><description>Engineer-tested methods for paint removal sanding that strip coatings fast while protecting wood, plaster, fiberglass, and metal from gouges.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="paint-removal-sanding-without-substrate-damage"&gt;Paint Removal Sanding Without Substrate Damage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Saturday light came in low as I rolled the garage door open, coffee steaming on the bench and an old pine door leaning against a pair of horses. I’d painted it twice over the years and regretted both coats: drips along the panels, brush marks telegraphing in every direction, and an all-over chalkiness that made the hardware look fancier than the door deserved. I wanted a clean reset—bare wood, crisp edges, and a surface ready to take finish properly—but without the scars I’ve made in the past. If you’ve ever slipped with a sander and bitten into softwood or plaster, you know the sinking feeling. The goal this time: do the job with the precision of a machinist. For that, paint removal sanding would have to be deliberate, measurable, and controlled.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/11.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/28/how-to-sand-old-paint-without-gouging-the-substrate-paint-removal-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-old-paint-without-gouging-the-substrate-paint-removal-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/28/how-to-sand-old-paint-without-gouging-the-substrate-paint-removal-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-old-paint-without-gouging-the-substrate-paint-removal-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/28/how-to-sand-old-paint-without-gouging-the-substrate-paint-removal-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-old-paint-without-gouging-the-substrate-paint-removal-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/28/how-to-sand-old-paint-without-gouging-the-substrate-paint-removal-sanding/cards/instagram/how-to-sand-old-paint-without-gouging-the-substrate-paint-removal-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/28/how-to-sand-old-paint-without-gouging-the-substrate-paint-removal-sanding/cards/instagram/how-to-sand-old-paint-without-gouging-the-substrate-paint-removal-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/28/how-to-sand-old-paint-without-gouging-the-substrate-paint-removal-sanding/cards/instagram/how-to-sand-old-paint-without-gouging-the-substrate-paint-removal-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/28/how-to-sand-old-paint-without-gouging-the-substrate-paint-removal-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-to-sand-old-paint-without-gouging-the-substrate-paint-removal-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/28/how-to-sand-old-paint-without-gouging-the-substrate-paint-removal-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-to-sand-old-paint-without-gouging-the-substrate-paint-removal-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/28/how-to-sand-old-paint-without-gouging-the-substrate-paint-removal-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-to-sand-old-paint-without-gouging-the-substrate-paint-removal-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/28/how-to-sand-old-paint-without-gouging-the-substrate-paint-removal-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-old-paint-without-gouging-the-substrate-paint-removal-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/28/how-to-sand-old-paint-without-gouging-the-substrate-paint-removal-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-old-paint-without-gouging-the-substrate-paint-removal-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/28/how-to-sand-old-paint-without-gouging-the-substrate-paint-removal-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-old-paint-without-gouging-the-substrate-paint-removal-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Epa Rrp Containment Setup For Lead Paint Sanding</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 15:44:17 +0000</pubDate><category>Paint Removal &amp; Surface Prep</category><category>paint prep</category><category>rust removal</category><category>primer coat</category><category>sanding block</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><description>A technical guide to EPA RRP containment for lead-safe sanding, covering surface prep, abrasive selection, HEPA capture, and low-dust workflows.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="epa-rrp-containment-for-lead-safe-sanding"&gt;EPA RRP Containment for Lead-Safe Sanding&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a moment, right before the sander touches the surface, when a room holds its breath. You’ve taped the vents, rolled up area rugs, shuffled furniture to the hallway. In an older home—maybe one built just after the war, with trim thick enough to show paint strata like tree rings—you feel the weight of history in the baseboards and widow’s walk. You also feel responsibility. Dust is memory made airborne, and when that dust contains lead, it crosses the boundary from nuisance to long-term health hazard in seconds. The job becomes less about “cleaning up later” and more about “controlling everything now.” That’s precisely where epa rrp containment setup lives, and it’s the fulcrum between craftsmanship and care.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/24.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding/cards/facebook/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding/cards/facebook/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding/cards/facebook/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding/cards/instagram/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding/cards/instagram/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding/cards/instagram/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding/cards/pinterest/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding/cards/pinterest/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding/cards/pinterest/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding/cards/facebook/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding/cards/facebook/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding/cards/facebook/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Reusable Sponges To Reduce Waste</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 17:37:43 +0000</pubDate><category>Eco &amp; Non-Toxic Abrasives</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>dry sanding</category><category>paint prep</category><category>dust control</category><category>joint compound</category><description>Expert guide to eco sandpaper and reusable sponges: prep, grit strategy, cleaning cycles, and workflows that reduce waste without compromising finish.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="eco-sandpaper-and-reusable-sanding-sponges"&gt;Eco sandpaper and reusable sanding sponges&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a Saturday morning, I stood over a maple desk that had seen too many years of coffee rings and hurried notes. The sun cut across the shop floor, catching dust motes suspended in a quiet orbit around the project that would—if I did this right—become an heirloom. Next to me sat a half-empty box of worn paper sheets and a small pile of discarded grits I’d promised myself I’d send to recycling (a promise I rarely kept). It felt familiar and a little defeating: endless sheets, clogged in minutes, and a small mountain of waste. That was the morning I switched the workflow, integrating reusable sanding sponges and eco sandpaper into a process designed not just for finish quality, but for sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/29.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper/cards/instagram/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper/cards/instagram/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper/cards/instagram/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Use Hard Backing Pads For Flat Panels</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/27/use-hard-backing-pads-for-flat-panels-sander-interface-pad/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/27/use-hard-backing-pads-for-flat-panels-sander-interface-pad/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 27 Nov 2025 14:34:47 +0000</pubDate><category>Interface Pads &amp; Backing Pads</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-360</category><category>paint prep</category><description>Get pro-flat panels with hard backing pads.

&lt;p&gt;There’s a certain hush that falls over the shop when a panel finally reads flat. The lights reflect in a clean, uninterrupted glide across the grain, and you can feel the promise of that finish under your fingertips. I remember a maple tabletop that fought me for three late nights. I had a soft pad on my sander, a foam disc, and the hope that “gentle” would keep me safe. Instead, the board smiled back at me with a washboard of highs and lows. Swirls near the edges, dipped corners, and a telegraphed glue line that wouldn’t die. The fix wasn’t more time; it was the right pad. I swapped to a hard backing pad, parked a sander interface pad for the profiles and inside corners, and the surface transformed—crisp, even, and ready to finish. That day, I stopped thinking of pads as accessories and started treating them like cutting tools.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/01.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/27/use-hard-backing-pads-for-flat-panels-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/use-hard-backing-pads-for-flat-panels-sander-interface-pad.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/27/use-hard-backing-pads-for-flat-panels-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/use-hard-backing-pads-for-flat-panels-sander-interface-pad.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/27/use-hard-backing-pads-for-flat-panels-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/use-hard-backing-pads-for-flat-panels-sander-interface-pad.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/27/use-hard-backing-pads-for-flat-panels-sander-interface-pad/cards/instagram/use-hard-backing-pads-for-flat-panels-sander-interface-pad.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/27/use-hard-backing-pads-for-flat-panels-sander-interface-pad/cards/instagram/use-hard-backing-pads-for-flat-panels-sander-interface-pad.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/27/use-hard-backing-pads-for-flat-panels-sander-interface-pad/cards/instagram/use-hard-backing-pads-for-flat-panels-sander-interface-pad.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/27/use-hard-backing-pads-for-flat-panels-sander-interface-pad/cards/pinterest/use-hard-backing-pads-for-flat-panels-sander-interface-pad.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/27/use-hard-backing-pads-for-flat-panels-sander-interface-pad/cards/pinterest/use-hard-backing-pads-for-flat-panels-sander-interface-pad.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/27/use-hard-backing-pads-for-flat-panels-sander-interface-pad/cards/pinterest/use-hard-backing-pads-for-flat-panels-sander-interface-pad.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/27/use-hard-backing-pads-for-flat-panels-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/use-hard-backing-pads-for-flat-panels-sander-interface-pad.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/27/use-hard-backing-pads-for-flat-panels-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/use-hard-backing-pads-for-flat-panels-sander-interface-pad.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/27/use-hard-backing-pads-for-flat-panels-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/use-hard-backing-pads-for-flat-panels-sander-interface-pad.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>When To Choose Chemical Stripping Instead Of Sanding</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 13:38:25 +0000</pubDate><category>Paint Removal &amp; Surface Prep</category><category>paint prep</category><category>rust removal</category><category>primer coat</category><category>sanding block</category><category>orbital sander</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Learn when chemical stripping beats sanding.

&lt;p&gt;You can hear a project before you see it: the whine of an orbital sander, the hiss of a dust extractor, the rasp of grit carving tracks in an old finish. The other soundtrack is a quiet shop, drop cloths taped down, a gelled stripper turning tired paint into ribbons under a plastic scraper. Both are valid approaches to surface preparation, and the results hinge on choosing the right path at the outset. The paint stripping vs sanding decision is less about preference and more about material science, coating behavior, and the downstream finish you expect. If you’re staring at a five-layer porch rail, a veneered dresser, or a fiberglass hatch, the fastest route to a clean, profile-ready surface may not be the one you think.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/10.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding/cards/instagram/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding/cards/instagram/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding/cards/instagram/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding/cards/pinterest/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding/cards/pinterest/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding/cards/pinterest/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Grit Selection For Antifouling Paint Prep</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2025 14:20:36 +0000</pubDate><category>Marine Sanding</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-70</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-280</category><category>dust control</category><category>paint prep</category><category>orbital sander</category><description>Learn how to choose the right sanding grits for antifouling prep.

&lt;p&gt;You feel it as soon as the travel lift sets your boat on the stands: that mix of relief and responsibility. The hull looks taller on land, the waterline a faint stain of the season gone by. There’s a quiet rhythm to the boatyard in the early hours—compressors breathe, gulls trade commentary, coffee cools beside a bucket of scrapers. You run your hand over the bottom paint and feel the story of boat sanding before you even begin: the hard, glossy ridges where the sander skipped, the chalky patches that might be underbound, the thin spots the sea worked harder than you realized. It’s tempting to rush the job and get straight to brushing on antifouling. But prep is where the next season is won. Choosing the right grit is the difference between a coat that stays put and one that blisters, powders, or peels when the boat is back in her element.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/05.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding/cards/instagram/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding/cards/instagram/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding/cards/instagram/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding/cards/pinterest/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding/cards/pinterest/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding/cards/pinterest/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Strip Failing Polyurethane Then Sand Residue Before Refinishing</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 13:37:09 +0000</pubDate><category>Paint Removal &amp; Surface Prep</category><category>paint prep</category><category>rust removal</category><category>primer coat</category><category>sanding block</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-1500</category><description>Learn expert steps for coating removal, sanding residue, and refinishing wood for durable, beautiful results with safe methods, tools, and pro tips.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="coating-removal-and-refinishing-failing-polyurethane"&gt;Coating Removal and Refinishing Failing Polyurethane&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning light spilled across the dining table you’ve hosted around for years. You set down a mug and notice the surface clings just a little; a ring remains, faint but stubborn. Along the edges, the once-smooth finish has turned brittle and chalky, tiny flakes catching the light like dust motes in motion. You run a fingertip across the spot where a placemat lives—glossy here, dull there, with a subtle ridge between. The finish is failing, and it’s happening faster than you’d like. You can feel the stakes: this is not just a table—it’s family dinners, late-night projects, first-day-of-school photos, and the clean expanse that makes a home feel ready.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/23.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal/cards/facebook/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal/cards/facebook/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal/cards/facebook/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal/cards/instagram/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal/cards/instagram/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal/cards/instagram/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal/cards/pinterest/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal/cards/pinterest/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal/cards/pinterest/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal/cards/facebook/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal/cards/facebook/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal/cards/facebook/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Scuff Sand Glossy Paint To Improve Primer Adhesion</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 05 Nov 2025 04:18:59 +0000</pubDate><category>Paint Removal &amp; Surface Prep</category><category>paint prep</category><category>rust removal</category><category>primer coat</category><category>sanding block</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>dust control</category><description>Learn how to scuff sand glossy paint for superior primer adhesion.

&lt;p&gt;There’s a moment every DIYer knows: coffee in hand, paint tray loaded, roller whispering across the wall—and then the dreaded slip. The glossy trim or cabinet door you thought you tamed suddenly sheds the new coat like a rain jacket, beading, sliding, or peeling on touch. I’ve been in that room more times than I can count, from weekend bathrooms to full commercial corridors, and the conclusion’s always the same—before color comes control. That control starts with surface preparation. Not flashy, not glamorous, but it’s the one step that makes every coat after it look better and last longer.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation/cards/facebook/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation/cards/facebook/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation/cards/facebook/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation/cards/instagram/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation/cards/instagram/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation/cards/instagram/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation/cards/pinterest/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation/cards/pinterest/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation/cards/pinterest/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation/cards/facebook/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation/cards/facebook/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation/cards/facebook/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Proper Panel Degreasing Before Sanding And Painting</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/proper-panel-degreasing-before-sanding-and-painting-car-surface-prep/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/proper-panel-degreasing-before-sanding-and-painting-car-surface-prep/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 05 Nov 2025 00:02:33 +0000</pubDate><category>Auto Body Sanding</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>paint prep</category><category>dust control</category><description>Learn proper panel degreasing for car surface prep: the solvents, steps, and shop tips to avoid fisheyes and get paint to stick like it should.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="car-surface-prep-proper-panel-degreasing"&gt;Car Surface Prep: Proper Panel Degreasing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning, shop door cracked open, coffee perched on the fender, and a faint citrus-solvent smell in the air. That’s the moment I love most: quiet, focused, and full of possibility. You tape off the trim, set your DA sander on the cart, and reach for a clean set of nitrile gloves. If you’ve ever laid down a base coat only to watch it crater into fisheyes or peel at the edges, you know the pain of skipping a step in car surface prep. Most of the time the culprit isn’t your gun, your paint, or the weather—it’s contamination that never should have made it to the paint stage.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/proper-panel-degreasing-before-sanding-and-painting-car-surface-prep/cards/facebook/proper-panel-degreasing-before-sanding-and-painting-car-surface-prep.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/proper-panel-degreasing-before-sanding-and-painting-car-surface-prep/cards/facebook/proper-panel-degreasing-before-sanding-and-painting-car-surface-prep.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/proper-panel-degreasing-before-sanding-and-painting-car-surface-prep/cards/facebook/proper-panel-degreasing-before-sanding-and-painting-car-surface-prep.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/proper-panel-degreasing-before-sanding-and-painting-car-surface-prep/cards/instagram/proper-panel-degreasing-before-sanding-and-painting-car-surface-prep.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/proper-panel-degreasing-before-sanding-and-painting-car-surface-prep/cards/instagram/proper-panel-degreasing-before-sanding-and-painting-car-surface-prep.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/proper-panel-degreasing-before-sanding-and-painting-car-surface-prep/cards/instagram/proper-panel-degreasing-before-sanding-and-painting-car-surface-prep.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/proper-panel-degreasing-before-sanding-and-painting-car-surface-prep/cards/pinterest/proper-panel-degreasing-before-sanding-and-painting-car-surface-prep.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/proper-panel-degreasing-before-sanding-and-painting-car-surface-prep/cards/pinterest/proper-panel-degreasing-before-sanding-and-painting-car-surface-prep.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/proper-panel-degreasing-before-sanding-and-painting-car-surface-prep/cards/pinterest/proper-panel-degreasing-before-sanding-and-painting-car-surface-prep.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/proper-panel-degreasing-before-sanding-and-painting-car-surface-prep/cards/facebook/proper-panel-degreasing-before-sanding-and-painting-car-surface-prep.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/proper-panel-degreasing-before-sanding-and-painting-car-surface-prep/cards/facebook/proper-panel-degreasing-before-sanding-and-painting-car-surface-prep.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/proper-panel-degreasing-before-sanding-and-painting-car-surface-prep/cards/facebook/proper-panel-degreasing-before-sanding-and-painting-car-surface-prep.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Best Grit Sheets For Detail Sanding Tools</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/best-grit-sheets-for-detail-sanding-tools-detail-sander-sheets/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/best-grit-sheets-for-detail-sanding-tools-detail-sander-sheets/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 02:40:19 +0000</pubDate><category>Detail Sander Sheets</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>paint prep</category><description>Engineer-tested guide to detail sander sheets: grit selection, backings, dust control, and brand picks for wood, paint, and plastics.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="best-grit-detail-sander-sheets-an-engineers-guide"&gt;Best Grit Detail Sander Sheets: An Engineer’s Guide&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a moment in every restoration project when the big tools step aside and the small corners decide the result. I hit that moment last winter, hunched over a mid-century nightstand with tapered legs and a drawer pull recess shaped like a teardrop. My random orbit sander took care of the top in minutes, but the tight inside curves and the sharp transitions around the pull were a different story. I swapped to a detail sander and discovered what many DIYers learn the hard way: the tool is only as precise as the sheet you mount on it.

&lt;p&gt;The first time I chased a true mirror finish, I was standing under the humming fluorescents of my shop at 10 p.m., jacket draped over a fender to keep it from picking up dust. The hood in front of me was deep black, fresh from a careful correction, but it still didn’t sing. It was 95% there—glossy to most eyes—yet under a cross-light, I could see faint micro-marring, a subtle haze that robbed it of that liquid, piano-black look. Earlier that afternoon, I’d refined orange peel and denibbed runs with P2000 and P3000 polishing sandpaper, keeping the surface flat and honest so I’d know exactly what I was working with at the machine. The sanding was clean; the defects were leveled. But “glossy” and “mirror” are two different milestones, and the last 5% is where your technique has to be slower, lighter, and smarter.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/05.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/23/final-jeweling-pass-for-mirror-gloss-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/final-jeweling-pass-for-mirror-gloss-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/23/final-jeweling-pass-for-mirror-gloss-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/final-jeweling-pass-for-mirror-gloss-polishing-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/23/final-jeweling-pass-for-mirror-gloss-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/final-jeweling-pass-for-mirror-gloss-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/23/final-jeweling-pass-for-mirror-gloss-polishing-sandpaper/cards/instagram/final-jeweling-pass-for-mirror-gloss-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/23/final-jeweling-pass-for-mirror-gloss-polishing-sandpaper/cards/instagram/final-jeweling-pass-for-mirror-gloss-polishing-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/23/final-jeweling-pass-for-mirror-gloss-polishing-sandpaper/cards/instagram/final-jeweling-pass-for-mirror-gloss-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/23/final-jeweling-pass-for-mirror-gloss-polishing-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/final-jeweling-pass-for-mirror-gloss-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/23/final-jeweling-pass-for-mirror-gloss-polishing-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/final-jeweling-pass-for-mirror-gloss-polishing-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/23/final-jeweling-pass-for-mirror-gloss-polishing-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/final-jeweling-pass-for-mirror-gloss-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/23/final-jeweling-pass-for-mirror-gloss-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/final-jeweling-pass-for-mirror-gloss-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/23/final-jeweling-pass-for-mirror-gloss-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/final-jeweling-pass-for-mirror-gloss-polishing-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/23/final-jeweling-pass-for-mirror-gloss-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/final-jeweling-pass-for-mirror-gloss-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Speed And Pressure Control For Polishers</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/06/speed-and-pressure-control-for-polishers-polishing-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/06/speed-and-pressure-control-for-polishers-polishing-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 14:38:19 +0000</pubDate><category>Polishing &amp; Finishing</category><category>mirror finish</category><category>polishing pads</category><category>grit progression</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-1200</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>metal polishing</category><description>Engineer-tested guide to speed and pressure control in polishers, grit strategy with polishing sandpaper, and tips for flawless finishes on paint and metal.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="polisher-speed-pressure-and-polishing-sandpaper"&gt;Polisher Speed, Pressure, and Polishing Sandpaper&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first time I learned to control a polisher wasn’t in a lab—it was on a cool Saturday morning in a borrowed garage, headlights bouncing off a steel hood speckled with sanding marks. The bench behind me was neatly laid out: pads sorted by density, a torque-laden rotary, a dual-action polisher, and strips of polishing sandpaper from P800 to P3000. I wasn’t chasing a showroom gloss for Instagram. I was chasing repeatability. Could I consistently hit the same finish, panel after panel, by controlling just two variables—speed and pressure—regardless of pad brand or compound? That kind of control feels less like artistry and more like engineering.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/18.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/06/speed-and-pressure-control-for-polishers-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/speed-and-pressure-control-for-polishers-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/06/speed-and-pressure-control-for-polishers-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/speed-and-pressure-control-for-polishers-polishing-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/06/speed-and-pressure-control-for-polishers-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/speed-and-pressure-control-for-polishers-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/06/speed-and-pressure-control-for-polishers-polishing-sandpaper/cards/instagram/speed-and-pressure-control-for-polishers-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/06/speed-and-pressure-control-for-polishers-polishing-sandpaper/cards/instagram/speed-and-pressure-control-for-polishers-polishing-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/06/speed-and-pressure-control-for-polishers-polishing-sandpaper/cards/instagram/speed-and-pressure-control-for-polishers-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/06/speed-and-pressure-control-for-polishers-polishing-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/speed-and-pressure-control-for-polishers-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/06/speed-and-pressure-control-for-polishers-polishing-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/speed-and-pressure-control-for-polishers-polishing-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/06/speed-and-pressure-control-for-polishers-polishing-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/speed-and-pressure-control-for-polishers-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/06/speed-and-pressure-control-for-polishers-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/speed-and-pressure-control-for-polishers-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/06/speed-and-pressure-control-for-polishers-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/speed-and-pressure-control-for-polishers-polishing-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/06/speed-and-pressure-control-for-polishers-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/speed-and-pressure-control-for-polishers-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Set Up Polishing Wheels Without Cross Contamination</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/16/set-up-polishing-wheels-without-cross-contamination-metal-polishing/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/16/set-up-polishing-wheels-without-cross-contamination-metal-polishing/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 13:43:54 +0000</pubDate><category>Metal Polishing &amp; Rust Repair</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>metal polishing</category><category>dust control</category><description>Engineer-tested guide to set up polishing wheels without cross-contamination in metal polishing, including compounds, speeds, storage, and cleaning.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="metal-polishing-set-up-wheels-without-contamination"&gt;Metal Polishing: Set Up Wheels Without Contamination&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Late on a Saturday, the shop is quiet except for the hum of a bench grinder. The first pass on a stainless bracket looks promising—deep scratches erased, geometry still crisp. You switch to a softer buff, strobe the rim with a stick of green compound, and lean in. Then it happens: faint, spiraling hairlines that catch the raking light. You back off and try again, softer pressure, fresh angle. The lines remain—ghosts you can’t unsee. Something, somewhere, jumped the fence. If you’ve spent hours chasing a mirror only to be ambushed at the final inch, you’ve likely fallen victim to the invisible enemy of metal polishing: cross contamination.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/25.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/16/set-up-polishing-wheels-without-cross-contamination-metal-polishing/cards/facebook/set-up-polishing-wheels-without-cross-contamination-metal-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/16/set-up-polishing-wheels-without-cross-contamination-metal-polishing/cards/facebook/set-up-polishing-wheels-without-cross-contamination-metal-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/16/set-up-polishing-wheels-without-cross-contamination-metal-polishing/cards/facebook/set-up-polishing-wheels-without-cross-contamination-metal-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/16/set-up-polishing-wheels-without-cross-contamination-metal-polishing/cards/instagram/set-up-polishing-wheels-without-cross-contamination-metal-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/16/set-up-polishing-wheels-without-cross-contamination-metal-polishing/cards/instagram/set-up-polishing-wheels-without-cross-contamination-metal-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/16/set-up-polishing-wheels-without-cross-contamination-metal-polishing/cards/instagram/set-up-polishing-wheels-without-cross-contamination-metal-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/16/set-up-polishing-wheels-without-cross-contamination-metal-polishing/cards/pinterest/set-up-polishing-wheels-without-cross-contamination-metal-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/16/set-up-polishing-wheels-without-cross-contamination-metal-polishing/cards/pinterest/set-up-polishing-wheels-without-cross-contamination-metal-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/16/set-up-polishing-wheels-without-cross-contamination-metal-polishing/cards/pinterest/set-up-polishing-wheels-without-cross-contamination-metal-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/16/set-up-polishing-wheels-without-cross-contamination-metal-polishing/cards/facebook/set-up-polishing-wheels-without-cross-contamination-metal-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/16/set-up-polishing-wheels-without-cross-contamination-metal-polishing/cards/facebook/set-up-polishing-wheels-without-cross-contamination-metal-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/16/set-up-polishing-wheels-without-cross-contamination-metal-polishing/cards/facebook/set-up-polishing-wheels-without-cross-contamination-metal-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Choose Tripoli Versus White Rouge For Metal Polishing</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/choose-tripoli-versus-white-rouge-for-metal-polishing-metal-polishing/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/choose-tripoli-versus-white-rouge-for-metal-polishing-metal-polishing/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 23 Nov 2025 13:58:51 +0000</pubDate><category>Metal Polishing &amp; Rust Repair</category><category>grit-1200</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>metal polishing</category><description>Understand Tripoli vs white rouge, choose the right wheel, and build a fast, safe metal polishing workflow for aluminum, brass, and steel.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="tripoli-vs-white-rouge-metal-polishing-guide"&gt;Tripoli vs White Rouge: Metal Polishing Guide&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday light pours across your workbench. The brass cabinet pulls you removed last night look dull, like they’ve filed away years of handprints and turned them matte. Nearby, the stainless kettle you use every morning is fine but not pristine—tiny swirls catch the sun. You set out the tools you have: a bench grinder with buffing wheels, two mystery compound bars—one brown, one white—and a quiet hope that today’s the day your pieces go from “cleaned up” to truly gleaming. If you’ve ever stood in this exact moment, ready to begin but unsure which bar to reach for, you’re not alone. Metal polishing is both craft and sequence, and the right choice at the right time matters.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/08.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/choose-tripoli-versus-white-rouge-for-metal-polishing-metal-polishing/cards/facebook/choose-tripoli-versus-white-rouge-for-metal-polishing-metal-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/choose-tripoli-versus-white-rouge-for-metal-polishing-metal-polishing/cards/facebook/choose-tripoli-versus-white-rouge-for-metal-polishing-metal-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/choose-tripoli-versus-white-rouge-for-metal-polishing-metal-polishing/cards/facebook/choose-tripoli-versus-white-rouge-for-metal-polishing-metal-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/choose-tripoli-versus-white-rouge-for-metal-polishing-metal-polishing/cards/instagram/choose-tripoli-versus-white-rouge-for-metal-polishing-metal-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/choose-tripoli-versus-white-rouge-for-metal-polishing-metal-polishing/cards/instagram/choose-tripoli-versus-white-rouge-for-metal-polishing-metal-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/choose-tripoli-versus-white-rouge-for-metal-polishing-metal-polishing/cards/instagram/choose-tripoli-versus-white-rouge-for-metal-polishing-metal-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/choose-tripoli-versus-white-rouge-for-metal-polishing-metal-polishing/cards/pinterest/choose-tripoli-versus-white-rouge-for-metal-polishing-metal-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/choose-tripoli-versus-white-rouge-for-metal-polishing-metal-polishing/cards/pinterest/choose-tripoli-versus-white-rouge-for-metal-polishing-metal-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/choose-tripoli-versus-white-rouge-for-metal-polishing-metal-polishing/cards/pinterest/choose-tripoli-versus-white-rouge-for-metal-polishing-metal-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/choose-tripoli-versus-white-rouge-for-metal-polishing-metal-polishing/cards/facebook/choose-tripoli-versus-white-rouge-for-metal-polishing-metal-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/choose-tripoli-versus-white-rouge-for-metal-polishing-metal-polishing/cards/facebook/choose-tripoli-versus-white-rouge-for-metal-polishing-metal-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/choose-tripoli-versus-white-rouge-for-metal-polishing-metal-polishing/cards/facebook/choose-tripoli-versus-white-rouge-for-metal-polishing-metal-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Grit Progression For Aluminum Before Buffing</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/02/grit-progression-for-aluminum-before-buffing-metal-polishing/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/02/grit-progression-for-aluminum-before-buffing-metal-polishing/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 02 Nov 2025 23:37:34 +0000</pubDate><category>Metal Polishing &amp; Rust Repair</category><category>metal polishing</category><category>grit progression</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>clear coat</category><category>sanding block</category><description>Learn grit progression for aluminum and master metal polishing.

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine standing in your workshop, the soft hum of machinery around you, the air filled with the scent of fresh metal shavings. It&amp;rsquo;s a place of creation, where raw materials are transformed into shining, polished works of art. You&amp;rsquo;re holding a piece of aluminum, rough to the touch, yet full of potential. With the right techniques, this unassuming piece can become a mirror-like masterpiece.

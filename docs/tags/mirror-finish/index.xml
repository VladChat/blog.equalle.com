&lt;p&gt;There’s a particular quiet to the yard before sunrise. The halyards ping, the coffee steams in a chipped thermos, and the hull you’ve been avoiding stands there like a promise you can’t put off. I’ve been on both sides of that moment—rushing, dusty, and regretting shortcuts later—and the method that changed the game for me was wet boat sanding. Not because it’s pretty, but because it’s efficient, safer for your lungs, and easier to keep the neighbors and the yard manager happy. You control the mess. You protect the water you love. And you end the day with a hull that’s flatter, cooler, and ready to bond.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Remove 2000 Grit Sanding Scratches Efficiently</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/remove-2000-grit-sanding-scratches-efficiently-polishing-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/remove-2000-grit-sanding-scratches-efficiently-polishing-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 05 Nov 2025 05:18:58 +0000</pubDate><category>Polishing &amp; Finishing</category><category>mirror finish</category><category>polishing pads</category><category>grit progression</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>wet sanding</category><description>Learn how to remove 2000-grit sanding scratches fast with precise workflows, polishing sandpaper selection, and pro-level compounding techniques.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="polishing-sandpaper-erasing-2000-grit-scratches"&gt;Polishing Sandpaper: Erasing 2000-Grit Scratches&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a quiet Saturday morning, the garage feels like a studio. The door is up, the sun is low, and the panel you’ve just leveled with 2000-grit wet sanding is a uniform gray haze—deliberate, dense, and a little intimidating. At arm’s length the surface looks flat, but under a raking LED it blooms with tight linear tracks, the signature of controlled abrasion. This is the moment when confidence wavers: did you go too far, or not far enough? If you’ve ever paused and wondered how to erase that texture efficiently—without reintroducing waves, burning edges, or chasing your tail—this guide is for you.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Difference Between Compounding And Polishing</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 02:16:29 +0000</pubDate><category>Polishing &amp; Finishing</category><category>mirror finish</category><category>polishing pads</category><category>grit progression</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-1200</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>clear coat</category><description>Learn the difference between compounding and polishing, how to choose polishing sandpaper and pads, and the step-by-step process for flawless finishes.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="compounding-vs-polishing-guide-to-polishing-sandpaper"&gt;Compounding vs Polishing: Guide to Polishing Sandpaper&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a moment every craftsperson recognizes: you step into the garage or studio, sunlight cuts across a painted panel or tabletop, and you see everything—swirls you never meant to leave, scratches that catch the light just so, a haze that dulls the color you spent hours applying. Your instinct might be to reach for the strongest product you own, but knowing the difference between compounding and polishing—and where polishing sandpaper fits—can save time, material, and the finish you’re trying to protect. Maybe it’s the clear coat on your daily driver, the lacquer on a guitar body, or the resin on a turned pen blank. Different surfaces, same goal: remove defects while preserving as much material as possible.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><readingTime>11</readingTime></item></channel></rss>

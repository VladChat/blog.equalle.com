&lt;p&gt;You know that afternoon light that hits your workshop just right—sawdust floating like golden confetti, the radio low, a mug ring etched into the bench? That’s where precision starts for me. I remember the first time I tried to smooth a chipped glass shelf salvaged from a vintage cabinet. I treated it like hardwood: dry paper, firm pressure, and a “let’s get this done” pace. Ten minutes in, the edge flashed white, my pad squealed, and the glass pinged with that terrifying, crystalline chatter. I learned fast: glass doesn’t forgive heat. It stores stress the way steel stores spring.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/03.webp" medium="image"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Start Grit For Leveling High Spots</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/17/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/17/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 17 Nov 2025 15:18:37 +0000</pubDate><category>Plastic &amp; Epoxy Sanding</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-280</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><description>Learn the ideal start grit to level epoxy high spots, avoid clogging, and build a clean sanding workflow for flat, finish-ready surfaces.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="epoxy-sanding-best-start-grit-for-high-spots"&gt;Epoxy sanding: best start grit for high spots&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first pass tells the whole story. You stand over a curing project—maybe a kayak hull, a countertop, or a floor section—with yesterday’s resin gone glassy and a few unkind ridges catching the raking light. Your hand slides across the surface and pauses on a drip, a seam, a ripple that won’t disappear by wishful thinking. You can hear the random orbital sander on the bench before you touch it. The only decision that matters now: what grit to start with. Get it wrong and you burn time, discs, and patience. Get it right and the surface flatness comes quickly, scratches stack predictably, and the finish you planned is still in reach. I’ve spent years chasing that first cut—especially during epoxy sanding—because the first cut sets your entire workflow’s cost, heat load, and scratch management.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/28.webp" medium="image"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Flush Slurry To Prevent Loading</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/16/flush-slurry-to-prevent-loading-wet-dry-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/16/flush-slurry-to-prevent-loading-wet-dry-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 16 Nov 2025 15:10:09 +0000</pubDate><category>Waterproof &amp; Wet/Dry Paper</category><category>grit-280</category><category>clear coat</category><category>grit progression</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>sanding block</category><description>Learn how to flush slurry to prevent loading with wet dry sandpaper.

&lt;p&gt;The first time I noticed loading, I was hunched over a maple cutting board in a chilly garage, chasing a glass-smooth finish that never seemed to arrive. The sandpaper was supposed to be “the good stuff,” and I was stepping through the grits like a textbook. But after a few strokes, the sheet glazed over. Instead of cutting, it skated—leaving faint scorch marks and a haze of streaks. I swapped sheets, pressed harder, tried angles. Same story: the paper clogged, and the surface got warmer. That’s when the lightbulb went off. It wasn’t the grit. It wasn’t the wood. It was the slurry—swarf, resin, and water—hanging around and turning my abrasive into a slick.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/24.webp" medium="image"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Sand Gelcoat Before Repairs Or Coating</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/sand-gelcoat-before-repairs-or-coating-boat-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/sand-gelcoat-before-repairs-or-coating-boat-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 23:56:18 +0000</pubDate><category>Marine Sanding</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-280</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-600</category><category>dry sanding</category><category>dust control</category><category>wet sanding</category><description>Engineer-tested guide to boat sanding gelcoat for repairs or recoating: grits, tools, wet vs dry, adhesion science, and step-by-step prep.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="boat-sanding-for-gelcoat-repairs-prep-and-technique"&gt;Boat sanding for gelcoat repairs: prep and technique&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The morning wind riffles the marina flags as you step onto the dock with a sander in one hand and masking tape in the other. Yesterday’s chop left salt crystals on the rails; last season left a constellation of nicks in the gelcoat, a chalky haze along the topsides, and the faint outline of old repairs. It’s tempting to rush straight to coating—one more layer to hide the blemishes—but that only traps problems under gloss. The difference between a repair that lasts one season and one that lasts a decade starts long before the roller hits the pan. It starts with boat sanding done with intention.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Use Diamond Or Sic For Glass Edges</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 23:29:24 +0000</pubDate><category>Glass &amp; Ceramics Sanding</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-280</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1200</category><category>grit-2500</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>wet sanding</category><description>Technical guide to glass sanding for chip‑free edges using diamond or SiC abrasives, with grit sequences, coolant control, and polishing workflows.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="glass-sanding-for-clean-safe-edges-diamond-vs-sic"&gt;Glass sanding for clean, safe edges: diamond vs SiC&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The moment you lift a freshly cut pane, you feel it: the edge that looks fine from arm’s length but carries invisible threats—micro-chips, stress risers, and the slight granular drag under a fingertip that says the finish is not ready for handling. Anyone who has ever fit a glass shelf, framed a museum-grade print, or repurposed a bottle knows that the edge is where projects succeed or fail. That’s where glass sanding earns its keep. Thoughtful abrasive selection and disciplined technique turn a risky raw cut into a safe, optically clean edge that won’t shed fragments, haze, or propagate cracks under load. Whether you’re tuning a small arris for furniture-grade touch or chasing an optical polish on a laminated panel, the goal is the same: remove damage quickly, control heat, and leave a tight subsurface that won’t surprise you months later.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><readingTime>14</readingTime></item><item><title>Avoid Loading With Stearated Papers</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 20:47:55 +0000</pubDate><category>Plastic &amp; Epoxy Sanding</category><category>grit-280</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>dust control</category><category>grit progression</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>Master epoxy sanding without clogging.

&lt;p&gt;You know the moment: the shop is quiet, the resin river table catches morning light, and all you can see are tiny ridges, dust nibs, and a faint orange peel across that once-glassy pour. This is where projects are made—or marred. Epoxy sanding isn’t glamorous, but it’s the step that decides if your final finish looks like a mirror or a fogged window. And if you’ve ever had sandpaper load up in seconds, smear epoxy into gummy streaks, or clog your discs so fast you start doubting your gear, you’re not alone. I’ve been there—hands on the sander, vac humming, wondering why the surface keeps fighting back.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Soak Time For Wet Sanding Papers</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 19:47:57 +0000</pubDate><category>Waterproof &amp; Wet/Dry Paper</category><category>grit-280</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-1200</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>wet sanding</category><description>Learn the optimal soak times for wet dry sandpaper, how soaking affects abrasive performance, and precise workflows for wood, paint, and metal.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="wet-dry-sandpaper-soak-times-a-technical-guide"&gt;Wet Dry Sandpaper Soak Times: A Technical Guide&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shop is quiet except for the slow drip from a rinse bottle, pooling across a workbench where a clear-coated guitar body breathes under the lights. There’s a shallow tray of clean water, a few folded sheets of wet dry sandpaper, and a foam pad waiting like a promise. You press a fingertip to the lacquer—weeks of curing have left it hard, crisp, and unforgiving. You remember the last time you rushed the process and chased pigtails under a glaring shop light. Not today. Today, the water will do its work before the first stroke lands.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><readingTime>12</readingTime></item></channel></rss>

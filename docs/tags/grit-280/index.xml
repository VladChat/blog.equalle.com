&lt;p&gt;It starts with the first swipe on a sharp, splintery edge—maybe the oak tabletop you rescued, the cabinet door frame you’re painting for a bathroom refresh, or the picture frame for a gift that’s due tonight. In the quiet of the workshop, dust hangs in the light and you feel the edge transform under your fingers. The urge is to “just sand it” and keep going. But edges and profiles aren’t flat panels; they magnify every mistake. Round over too far and the joint line disappears. Skip a grit and scratch ghosts show up in the finish. Choose the wrong sandpaper grit and you’ll waste time or, worse, bruise a delicate profile you spent hours cutting.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/08.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit/cards/instagram/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit/cards/instagram/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit/cards/instagram/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit/cards/pinterest/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit/cards/pinterest/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit/cards/pinterest/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Edge Control Around Hardware And Seams</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 13:38:27 +0000</pubDate><category>Marine Sanding</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-280</category><category>grit-320</category><description>Advanced boat sanding techniques for edge control around hardware and seams, from abrasives and pads to workflows that protect profiles and finish quality.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="boat-sanding-mastery-edges-hardware-seams"&gt;Boat sanding mastery: edges, hardware, seams&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dock still smells of salt and diesel when you pull the cover back at first light. The hull prints the sunrise in dull reflections, beautiful from afar but cruel up close—pigtails, flat spots, and a halo of scuffs around the stanchion bases where an impatient hand once grazed the gelcoat. Today is about restraint as much as cutting power. Boat sanding isn’t hard in principle; it’s hard because boats are a collage of edges, radii, seams, and fasteners that punish every lapse in control. A random orbital can fair a panel in minutes, then choke at a cleat, overcut a toe rail, or trench a seam if you don’t recalibrate your technique and consumables for the geometry in front of you.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/06.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding/cards/instagram/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding/cards/instagram/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding/cards/instagram/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding/cards/pinterest/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding/cards/pinterest/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding/cards/pinterest/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Select Correct Belt Width For Task</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/select-correct-belt-width-for-task-sanding-belts/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/select-correct-belt-width-for-task-sanding-belts/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 11 Dec 2025 15:16:44 +0000</pubDate><category>Sanding Belts &amp; Machines</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-280</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Learn how to choose the correct sanding belt width for any task, with clear sizing steps, grit pairing advice, setup tips, and safety pointers.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="choosing-the-right-width-for-sanding-belts"&gt;Choosing the Right Width for Sanding Belts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a quiet Saturday morning, you dust off the benchtop sander you’ve had for years. The shop light warms your worktable as you reach for a fresh belt, determined to smooth a wobbly chair you promised to restore. Coffee steams nearby, the radio hums, and for a few minutes it feels like everything slows down. Then, a familiar frustration: chatter marks across the rail. You steady your hands, check alignment, slow your feed—and still the surface doesn’t level cleanly. It’s not your skill. It’s not the grit. It’s the width. This is where many makers and mechanics unknowingly lose time and precision: selecting the wrong width of sanding belts for the job.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/09.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/select-correct-belt-width-for-task-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/select-correct-belt-width-for-task-sanding-belts.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/select-correct-belt-width-for-task-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/select-correct-belt-width-for-task-sanding-belts.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/select-correct-belt-width-for-task-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/select-correct-belt-width-for-task-sanding-belts.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/select-correct-belt-width-for-task-sanding-belts/cards/instagram/select-correct-belt-width-for-task-sanding-belts.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/select-correct-belt-width-for-task-sanding-belts/cards/instagram/select-correct-belt-width-for-task-sanding-belts.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/select-correct-belt-width-for-task-sanding-belts/cards/instagram/select-correct-belt-width-for-task-sanding-belts.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/select-correct-belt-width-for-task-sanding-belts/cards/pinterest/select-correct-belt-width-for-task-sanding-belts.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/select-correct-belt-width-for-task-sanding-belts/cards/pinterest/select-correct-belt-width-for-task-sanding-belts.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/select-correct-belt-width-for-task-sanding-belts/cards/pinterest/select-correct-belt-width-for-task-sanding-belts.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/select-correct-belt-width-for-task-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/select-correct-belt-width-for-task-sanding-belts.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/select-correct-belt-width-for-task-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/select-correct-belt-width-for-task-sanding-belts.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/select-correct-belt-width-for-task-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/select-correct-belt-width-for-task-sanding-belts.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Denibbing With Ultra Fine Sponge Abrasives</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 11 Dec 2025 14:14:40 +0000</pubDate><category>Sanding Sponges</category><category>grit-280</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>mirror finish</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>dry sanding</category><category>clear coat</category><category>dust control</category><description>Learn denibbing with ultra fine sponge abrasives.

&lt;p&gt;The shop was quiet except for the gentle hum of the dust extractor and the tick of cooling lights. I’d just laid the final coat on a black cabinet door—high-gloss lacquer, deep and mirror-like. It looked perfect under the booth lamps… until I rolled it into raking light. There they were: tiny raised specks scattered like stars—dust nibs. No drama, no panic. I’ve been here before. This is where an ultra fine sanding sponge earns its keep. It doesn’t scream for attention like a sander or a buffer; it just quietly, precisely knocks down the dots that ruin a perfect finish.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/07.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge/cards/instagram/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge/cards/instagram/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge/cards/instagram/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge/cards/pinterest/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge/cards/pinterest/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge/cards/pinterest/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Sand Edges Straight With Block Control</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 11 Dec 2025 13:45:02 +0000</pubDate><category>Sanding Blocks</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-280</category><category>sanding block</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Engineer-tested methods to sand edges straight with block control—covering block materials, grits, pressure, and measurement for crisp, furniture-grade results.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="straight-edges-with-a-sanding-block-engineers-guide"&gt;Straight Edges with a Sanding Block: Engineer’s Guide&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a quiet satisfaction when a board’s edge goes from ragged to crisp under your fingertips. You sight down the length, catch a glint of shop light, and see a clean, uninterrupted line—no ripples, no dips, no proud corners snagging a cloth. That straightness is the difference between a door that closes like a whisper and one that bites the jamb. It’s the moment where craft meets physics, and for me—an engineer who lives for process—the right tool is what makes that moment repeatable. For edge work, that tool is a sanding block.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/05.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block/cards/facebook/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block/cards/facebook/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block/cards/facebook/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block/cards/instagram/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block/cards/instagram/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block/cards/instagram/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block/cards/facebook/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block/cards/facebook/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block/cards/facebook/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Use Light Pressure To Prevent Gouging</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/use-light-pressure-to-prevent-gouging-detail-sander-sheets/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/use-light-pressure-to-prevent-gouging-detail-sander-sheets/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 10 Dec 2025 16:10:27 +0000</pubDate><category>Detail Sander Sheets</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-280</category><category>grit progression</category><category>sanding block</category><description>Learn why light pressure prevents gouging and how to choose and use detail sander sheets for cleaner surfaces, longer abrasive life, and consistent finishes.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="why-detail-sander-sheets-require-a-light-touch"&gt;Why Detail Sander Sheets Require a Light Touch&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It starts with a hum—the compact orbit of a delta-pad gliding toward a tight inside corner where a cabinet door stile meets the rail. The walnut is older than your clamps, with grain that doesn’t forgive. You’ve prepped the shop, dialed down the RPM, and set up extraction, but your fingers still tense as you aim the tip into a fillet. Press too hard, and you’ll carve a shallow dish that daylight will announce the moment a finish hits. If you’ve ever found yourself polishing out a crater that appears only under raking light, you know the culprit: load. The solution isn’t exotic; it’s discipline. Use light pressure to prevent gouging—especially when your abrasive is fresh and your tool is nimble. That’s where the right detail sander sheets make or break the outcome.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/03.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/use-light-pressure-to-prevent-gouging-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/use-light-pressure-to-prevent-gouging-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/use-light-pressure-to-prevent-gouging-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/use-light-pressure-to-prevent-gouging-detail-sander-sheets.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/use-light-pressure-to-prevent-gouging-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/use-light-pressure-to-prevent-gouging-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/use-light-pressure-to-prevent-gouging-detail-sander-sheets/cards/instagram/use-light-pressure-to-prevent-gouging-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/use-light-pressure-to-prevent-gouging-detail-sander-sheets/cards/instagram/use-light-pressure-to-prevent-gouging-detail-sander-sheets.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/use-light-pressure-to-prevent-gouging-detail-sander-sheets/cards/instagram/use-light-pressure-to-prevent-gouging-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/use-light-pressure-to-prevent-gouging-detail-sander-sheets/cards/pinterest/use-light-pressure-to-prevent-gouging-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/use-light-pressure-to-prevent-gouging-detail-sander-sheets/cards/pinterest/use-light-pressure-to-prevent-gouging-detail-sander-sheets.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/use-light-pressure-to-prevent-gouging-detail-sander-sheets/cards/pinterest/use-light-pressure-to-prevent-gouging-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/use-light-pressure-to-prevent-gouging-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/use-light-pressure-to-prevent-gouging-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/use-light-pressure-to-prevent-gouging-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/use-light-pressure-to-prevent-gouging-detail-sander-sheets.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/use-light-pressure-to-prevent-gouging-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/use-light-pressure-to-prevent-gouging-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Best Sanding Sponge Grit For Trim Surface Prep</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 07 Dec 2025 15:12:05 +0000</pubDate><category>Trim &amp; Molding Sanding</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-280</category><category>grit-320</category><category>dry sanding</category><category>sanding block</category><category>dust control</category><description>Engineer-tested guide to pick the best sponge for trim, from grit selection to technique, for flawless adhesion and smooth paint on wood and MDF.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="best-sponge-for-trim-sanding-grits-that-last"&gt;Best sponge for trim: sanding grits that last&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning light spilled across the hallway, revealing every chip and ridge along the baseboards that I’d stopped seeing months ago. The kind of small defects you only notice when you decide to fix them. I laid out the drop cloths and opened the can of trim enamel, mentally penciling in a half-day project. Then I reached for a sponge for trim instead of paper. That choice seems small, but it’s the difference between a paint job that looks good today and one that still looks good next year. As an engineer, I’ve learned that coatings fail at interfaces, not in the middle of the film. And the interface—the mechanical “tooth” you cut into the substrate—comes from your abrasives.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/10.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim/cards/facebook/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim/cards/facebook/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim/cards/facebook/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim/cards/instagram/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim/cards/instagram/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim/cards/instagram/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim/cards/pinterest/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim/cards/pinterest/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim/cards/pinterest/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim/cards/facebook/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim/cards/facebook/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim/cards/facebook/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Grit Selection For Antifouling Paint Prep</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2025 14:20:36 +0000</pubDate><category>Marine Sanding</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-70</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-280</category><category>dust control</category><category>paint prep</category><category>orbital sander</category><description>Learn how to choose the right sanding grits for antifouling prep.

&lt;p&gt;You feel it as soon as the travel lift sets your boat on the stands: that mix of relief and responsibility. The hull looks taller on land, the waterline a faint stain of the season gone by. There’s a quiet rhythm to the boatyard in the early hours—compressors breathe, gulls trade commentary, coffee cools beside a bucket of scrapers. You run your hand over the bottom paint and feel the story of boat sanding before you even begin: the hard, glossy ridges where the sander skipped, the chalky patches that might be underbound, the thin spots the sea worked harder than you realized. It’s tempting to rush the job and get straight to brushing on antifouling. But prep is where the next season is won. Choosing the right grit is the difference between a coat that stays put and one that blisters, powders, or peels when the boat is back in her element.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/05.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding/cards/instagram/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding/cards/instagram/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding/cards/instagram/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding/cards/pinterest/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding/cards/pinterest/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding/cards/pinterest/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Keep Surfaces Wet To Control Heat</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2025 13:37:28 +0000</pubDate><category>Glass &amp; Ceramics Sanding</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-280</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-1200</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>Learn expert glass sanding techniques—why water matters, how to control heat, avoid cracks, and get a flawless edge with safe, practical workshop setups.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="glass-sanding-keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat"&gt;Glass Sanding: Keep Surfaces Wet to Control Heat&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know that afternoon light that hits your workshop just right—sawdust floating like golden confetti, the radio low, a mug ring etched into the bench? That’s where precision starts for me. I remember the first time I tried to smooth a chipped glass shelf salvaged from a vintage cabinet. I treated it like hardwood: dry paper, firm pressure, and a “let’s get this done” pace. Ten minutes in, the edge flashed white, my pad squealed, and the glass pinged with that terrifying, crystalline chatter. I learned fast: glass doesn’t forgive heat. It stores stress the way steel stores spring.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/03.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding/cards/instagram/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding/cards/instagram/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding/cards/instagram/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding/cards/pinterest/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding/cards/pinterest/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding/cards/pinterest/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Start Grit For Leveling High Spots</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/17/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/17/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 17 Nov 2025 15:18:37 +0000</pubDate><category>Plastic &amp; Epoxy Sanding</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-280</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><description>Learn the ideal start grit to level epoxy high spots, avoid clogging, and build a clean sanding workflow for flat, finish-ready surfaces.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="epoxy-sanding-best-start-grit-for-high-spots"&gt;Epoxy sanding: best start grit for high spots&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first pass tells the whole story. You stand over a curing project—maybe a kayak hull, a countertop, or a floor section—with yesterday’s resin gone glassy and a few unkind ridges catching the raking light. Your hand slides across the surface and pauses on a drip, a seam, a ripple that won’t disappear by wishful thinking. You can hear the random orbital sander on the bench before you touch it. The only decision that matters now: what grit to start with. Get it wrong and you burn time, discs, and patience. Get it right and the surface flatness comes quickly, scratches stack predictably, and the finish you planned is still in reach. I’ve spent years chasing that first cut—especially during epoxy sanding—because the first cut sets your entire workflow’s cost, heat load, and scratch management.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/28.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/17/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/17/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/17/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/17/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding/cards/instagram/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/17/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding/cards/instagram/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/17/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding/cards/instagram/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/17/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding/cards/pinterest/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/17/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding/cards/pinterest/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/17/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding/cards/pinterest/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/17/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/17/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/17/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Flush Slurry To Prevent Loading</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/16/flush-slurry-to-prevent-loading-wet-dry-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/16/flush-slurry-to-prevent-loading-wet-dry-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 16 Nov 2025 15:10:09 +0000</pubDate><category>Waterproof &amp; Wet/Dry Paper</category><category>grit-280</category><category>clear coat</category><category>grit progression</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>sanding block</category><description>Learn how to flush slurry to prevent loading with wet dry sandpaper.

&lt;p&gt;The first time I noticed loading, I was hunched over a maple cutting board in a chilly garage, chasing a glass-smooth finish that never seemed to arrive. The sandpaper was supposed to be “the good stuff,” and I was stepping through the grits like a textbook. But after a few strokes, the sheet glazed over. Instead of cutting, it skated—leaving faint scorch marks and a haze of streaks. I swapped sheets, pressed harder, tried angles. Same story: the paper clogged, and the surface got warmer. That’s when the lightbulb went off. It wasn’t the grit. It wasn’t the wood. It was the slurry—swarf, resin, and water—hanging around and turning my abrasive into a slick.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/24.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/16/flush-slurry-to-prevent-loading-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/flush-slurry-to-prevent-loading-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/16/flush-slurry-to-prevent-loading-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/flush-slurry-to-prevent-loading-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/16/flush-slurry-to-prevent-loading-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/flush-slurry-to-prevent-loading-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/16/flush-slurry-to-prevent-loading-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/instagram/flush-slurry-to-prevent-loading-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/16/flush-slurry-to-prevent-loading-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/instagram/flush-slurry-to-prevent-loading-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/16/flush-slurry-to-prevent-loading-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/instagram/flush-slurry-to-prevent-loading-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/16/flush-slurry-to-prevent-loading-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/flush-slurry-to-prevent-loading-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/16/flush-slurry-to-prevent-loading-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/flush-slurry-to-prevent-loading-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/16/flush-slurry-to-prevent-loading-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/flush-slurry-to-prevent-loading-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/16/flush-slurry-to-prevent-loading-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/flush-slurry-to-prevent-loading-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/16/flush-slurry-to-prevent-loading-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/flush-slurry-to-prevent-loading-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/16/flush-slurry-to-prevent-loading-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/flush-slurry-to-prevent-loading-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Sand Gelcoat Before Repairs Or Coating</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/sand-gelcoat-before-repairs-or-coating-boat-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/sand-gelcoat-before-repairs-or-coating-boat-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 23:56:18 +0000</pubDate><category>Marine Sanding</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-280</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-600</category><category>dry sanding</category><category>dust control</category><category>wet sanding</category><description>Engineer-tested guide to boat sanding gelcoat for repairs or recoating: grits, tools, wet vs dry, adhesion science, and step-by-step prep.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="boat-sanding-for-gelcoat-repairs-prep-and-technique"&gt;Boat sanding for gelcoat repairs: prep and technique&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The morning wind riffles the marina flags as you step onto the dock with a sander in one hand and masking tape in the other. Yesterday’s chop left salt crystals on the rails; last season left a constellation of nicks in the gelcoat, a chalky haze along the topsides, and the faint outline of old repairs. It’s tempting to rush straight to coating—one more layer to hide the blemishes—but that only traps problems under gloss. The difference between a repair that lasts one season and one that lasts a decade starts long before the roller hits the pan. It starts with boat sanding done with intention.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/sand-gelcoat-before-repairs-or-coating-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/sand-gelcoat-before-repairs-or-coating-boat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/sand-gelcoat-before-repairs-or-coating-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/sand-gelcoat-before-repairs-or-coating-boat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/sand-gelcoat-before-repairs-or-coating-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/sand-gelcoat-before-repairs-or-coating-boat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/sand-gelcoat-before-repairs-or-coating-boat-sanding/cards/instagram/sand-gelcoat-before-repairs-or-coating-boat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/sand-gelcoat-before-repairs-or-coating-boat-sanding/cards/instagram/sand-gelcoat-before-repairs-or-coating-boat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/sand-gelcoat-before-repairs-or-coating-boat-sanding/cards/instagram/sand-gelcoat-before-repairs-or-coating-boat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/sand-gelcoat-before-repairs-or-coating-boat-sanding/cards/pinterest/sand-gelcoat-before-repairs-or-coating-boat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/sand-gelcoat-before-repairs-or-coating-boat-sanding/cards/pinterest/sand-gelcoat-before-repairs-or-coating-boat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/sand-gelcoat-before-repairs-or-coating-boat-sanding/cards/pinterest/sand-gelcoat-before-repairs-or-coating-boat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/sand-gelcoat-before-repairs-or-coating-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/sand-gelcoat-before-repairs-or-coating-boat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/sand-gelcoat-before-repairs-or-coating-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/sand-gelcoat-before-repairs-or-coating-boat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/sand-gelcoat-before-repairs-or-coating-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/sand-gelcoat-before-repairs-or-coating-boat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Use Diamond Or Sic For Glass Edges</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 23:29:24 +0000</pubDate><category>Glass &amp; Ceramics Sanding</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-280</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1200</category><category>grit-2500</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>wet sanding</category><description>Technical guide to glass sanding for chip‑free edges using diamond or SiC abrasives, with grit sequences, coolant control, and polishing workflows.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="glass-sanding-for-clean-safe-edges-diamond-vs-sic"&gt;Glass sanding for clean, safe edges: diamond vs SiC&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The moment you lift a freshly cut pane, you feel it: the edge that looks fine from arm’s length but carries invisible threats—micro-chips, stress risers, and the slight granular drag under a fingertip that says the finish is not ready for handling. Anyone who has ever fit a glass shelf, framed a museum-grade print, or repurposed a bottle knows that the edge is where projects succeed or fail. That’s where glass sanding earns its keep. Thoughtful abrasive selection and disciplined technique turn a risky raw cut into a safe, optically clean edge that won’t shed fragments, haze, or propagate cracks under load. Whether you’re tuning a small arris for furniture-grade touch or chasing an optical polish on a laminated panel, the goal is the same: remove damage quickly, control heat, and leave a tight subsurface that won’t surprise you months later.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding/cards/instagram/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding/cards/instagram/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding/cards/instagram/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding/cards/pinterest/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding/cards/pinterest/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding/cards/pinterest/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>14</readingTime></item><item><title>Avoid Loading With Stearated Papers</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 20:47:55 +0000</pubDate><category>Plastic &amp; Epoxy Sanding</category><category>grit-280</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>dust control</category><category>grit progression</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>Master epoxy sanding without clogging.

&lt;p&gt;You know the moment: the shop is quiet, the resin river table catches morning light, and all you can see are tiny ridges, dust nibs, and a faint orange peel across that once-glassy pour. This is where projects are made—or marred. Epoxy sanding isn’t glamorous, but it’s the step that decides if your final finish looks like a mirror or a fogged window. And if you’ve ever had sandpaper load up in seconds, smear epoxy into gummy streaks, or clog your discs so fast you start doubting your gear, you’re not alone. I’ve been there—hands on the sander, vac humming, wondering why the surface keeps fighting back.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding/cards/instagram/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding/cards/instagram/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding/cards/instagram/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding/cards/pinterest/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding/cards/pinterest/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding/cards/pinterest/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Soak Time For Wet Sanding Papers</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 19:47:57 +0000</pubDate><category>Waterproof &amp; Wet/Dry Paper</category><category>grit-280</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-1200</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>wet sanding</category><description>Learn the optimal soak times for wet dry sandpaper, how soaking affects abrasive performance, and precise workflows for wood, paint, and metal.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="wet-dry-sandpaper-soak-times-a-technical-guide"&gt;Wet Dry Sandpaper Soak Times: A Technical Guide&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shop is quiet except for the slow drip from a rinse bottle, pooling across a workbench where a clear-coated guitar body breathes under the lights. There’s a shallow tray of clean water, a few folded sheets of wet dry sandpaper, and a foam pad waiting like a promise. You press a fingertip to the lacquer—weeks of curing have left it hard, crisp, and unforgiving. You remember the last time you rushed the process and chased pigtails under a glaring shop light. Not today. Today, the water will do its work before the first stroke lands.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/instagram/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/instagram/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/instagram/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item></channel></rss>

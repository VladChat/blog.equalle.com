&lt;p&gt;You know that afternoon light that hits your workshop just right—sawdust floating like golden confetti, the radio low, a mug ring etched into the bench? That’s where precision starts for me. I remember the first time I tried to smooth a chipped glass shelf salvaged from a vintage cabinet. I treated it like hardwood: dry paper, firm pressure, and a “let’s get this done” pace. Ten minutes in, the edge flashed white, my pad squealed, and the glass pinged with that terrifying, crystalline chatter. I learned fast: glass doesn’t forgive heat. It stores stress the way steel stores spring.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/03.webp" medium="image"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Remove 1500–2000 Grit Marks On Resin</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 07 Nov 2025 23:56:25 +0000</pubDate><category>Resin Polishing</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-1200</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-2500</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>dust control</category><description>Expert workflows to remove 1500–2000 grit marks on resin and achieve optical clarity with the right abrasives, compounds, and heat control.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="resin-polishing-erasing-15002000-grit-scratches"&gt;Resin Polishing: Erasing 1500–2000 Grit Scratches&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pendant looked flawless on the bench last night—glassy, color suspended in amber, edges softened just so. Then morning light hit it. Under a low-angle window beam, micro-scratches flared across the surface like frost on a windshield. You could feel your shoulders sag. You did the careful wet-sand through 1500 and 2000, kept the strokes even, swirled the slurry away. It should be done. But resin is unforgiving under raking light, and 1500–2000 grit marks hang on, whisper-thin but brutally visible. This is the moment where the craft turns from “sanding” to resin polishing: closing the cut, controlling heat, and stepping the abrasive system with intent until the surface stops being a surface and becomes a reflection.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><readingTime>9</readingTime></item><item><title>Soap To Water Ratio For Lubrication</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 07 Nov 2025 14:24:10 +0000</pubDate><category>Waterproof &amp; Wet/Dry Paper</category><category>grit-360</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-1200</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-2500</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>sanding block</category><description>Engineer-tested soap-to-water ratios for lubricating wet dry sandpaper on paint, wood, and metal.

&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning, a quiet garage, and a project you’ve promised yourself you’d finally finish. The headlight lenses are foggy. The table top has those telltale dust nibs in the polyurethane. A chef’s knife hangs dull on the magnetic strip, begging for bite. You fill a bucket, reach for a bottle of soap, and lay out sheets of wet dry sandpaper—ready to get to work. And then you pause. How much soap should actually go into the water? One drop? A teaspoon? More? You’ve heard “soapy water helps it glide,” but glide isn’t the only variable that matters. There’s also bite, swarf transport, scratch control, and heat. The soap-to-water ratio dictates whether you refine fast and clean—or skate on a film that kills cutting speed and blurs feedback.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Best Wet Sanding Sequence For Plastic Headlight Lenses</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 05 Nov 2025 03:51:43 +0000</pubDate><category>Headlight Restoration</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-1200</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-2500</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>A precise, technical guide to wet lens sanding for plastic headlights—abrasives, workflows, and UV protection to restore clear, durable optics.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="best-lens-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlights"&gt;Best Lens Sanding Sequence for Plastic Headlights&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twilight is the worst time to discover your headlights are lying to you. Streetlights smear into blurry halos; lane markers fade into a matte wash. You feel yourself leaning forward in the seat as if posture could coax more lumens from the housings. But the problem isn’t the bulb; it’s the lens. Polycarbonate oxidizes, turns porous, and grows a diffuse surface that scatters light instead of transmitting it. That’s fixable if you stop thinking of restoration as a wipe-on miracle and start treating it like precision surface engineering. This guide is about real lens sanding—structured, wet, and sequential—not guessing with a single pad until it “looks better.”&lt;/p&gt;</summary><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Use Diamond Or Sic For Glass Edges</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 23:29:24 +0000</pubDate><category>Glass &amp; Ceramics Sanding</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-280</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1200</category><category>grit-2500</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>wet sanding</category><description>Technical guide to glass sanding for chip‑free edges using diamond or SiC abrasives, with grit sequences, coolant control, and polishing workflows.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="glass-sanding-for-clean-safe-edges-diamond-vs-sic"&gt;Glass sanding for clean, safe edges: diamond vs SiC&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The moment you lift a freshly cut pane, you feel it: the edge that looks fine from arm’s length but carries invisible threats—micro-chips, stress risers, and the slight granular drag under a fingertip that says the finish is not ready for handling. Anyone who has ever fit a glass shelf, framed a museum-grade print, or repurposed a bottle knows that the edge is where projects succeed or fail. That’s where glass sanding earns its keep. Thoughtful abrasive selection and disciplined technique turn a risky raw cut into a safe, optically clean edge that won’t shed fragments, haze, or propagate cracks under load. Whether you’re tuning a small arris for furniture-grade touch or chasing an optical polish on a laminated panel, the goal is the same: remove damage quickly, control heat, and leave a tight subsurface that won’t surprise you months later.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><readingTime>14</readingTime></item><item><title>Soak Time For Wet Sanding Papers</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 19:47:57 +0000</pubDate><category>Waterproof &amp; Wet/Dry Paper</category><category>grit-280</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-1200</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>wet sanding</category><description>Learn the optimal soak times for wet dry sandpaper, how soaking affects abrasive performance, and precise workflows for wood, paint, and metal.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="wet-dry-sandpaper-soak-times-a-technical-guide"&gt;Wet Dry Sandpaper Soak Times: A Technical Guide&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shop is quiet except for the slow drip from a rinse bottle, pooling across a workbench where a clear-coated guitar body breathes under the lights. There’s a shallow tray of clean water, a few folded sheets of wet dry sandpaper, and a foam pad waiting like a promise. You press a fingertip to the lacquer—weeks of curing have left it hard, crisp, and unforgiving. You remember the last time you rushed the process and chased pigtails under a glaring shop light. Not today. Today, the water will do its work before the first stroke lands.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Difference Between Compounding And Polishing</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 02:16:29 +0000</pubDate><category>Polishing &amp; Finishing</category><category>mirror finish</category><category>polishing pads</category><category>grit progression</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-1200</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>clear coat</category><description>Learn the difference between compounding and polishing, how to choose polishing sandpaper and pads, and the step-by-step process for flawless finishes.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="compounding-vs-polishing-guide-to-polishing-sandpaper"&gt;Compounding vs Polishing: Guide to Polishing Sandpaper&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a moment every craftsperson recognizes: you step into the garage or studio, sunlight cuts across a painted panel or tabletop, and you see everything—swirls you never meant to leave, scratches that catch the light just so, a haze that dulls the color you spent hours applying. Your instinct might be to reach for the strongest product you own, but knowing the difference between compounding and polishing—and where polishing sandpaper fits—can save time, material, and the finish you’re trying to protect. Maybe it’s the clear coat on your daily driver, the lacquer on a guitar body, or the resin on a turned pen blank. Different surfaces, same goal: remove defects while preserving as much material as possible.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><readingTime>11</readingTime></item></channel></rss>

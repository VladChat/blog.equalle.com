&lt;p&gt;A few hours before guests arrived, I watched a friend trace a fingertip over the chipped rim of a vintage decanter—his grandmother’s. The room was quiet, the kind of quiet that magnifies small flaws into loud ones. The plan was simple: true the rim, restore the clarity, and bring back the smooth hand-feel that says this object is cared for. He had the abrasives, a spray bottle, a soft pad, and the patience to learn. What he didn’t have yet—what most people underestimate—is a deliberate grit progression that avoids planting damage deeper than you can later remove. Glass sanding looks deceptively simple. The physics behind it is not.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/20.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/06/avoid-deep-scratches-by-skipping-grits-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/avoid-deep-scratches-by-skipping-grits-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/06/avoid-deep-scratches-by-skipping-grits-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/avoid-deep-scratches-by-skipping-grits-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/06/avoid-deep-scratches-by-skipping-grits-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/avoid-deep-scratches-by-skipping-grits-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/06/avoid-deep-scratches-by-skipping-grits-glass-sanding/cards/instagram/avoid-deep-scratches-by-skipping-grits-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/06/avoid-deep-scratches-by-skipping-grits-glass-sanding/cards/instagram/avoid-deep-scratches-by-skipping-grits-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/06/avoid-deep-scratches-by-skipping-grits-glass-sanding/cards/instagram/avoid-deep-scratches-by-skipping-grits-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/06/avoid-deep-scratches-by-skipping-grits-glass-sanding/cards/pinterest/avoid-deep-scratches-by-skipping-grits-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/06/avoid-deep-scratches-by-skipping-grits-glass-sanding/cards/pinterest/avoid-deep-scratches-by-skipping-grits-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/06/avoid-deep-scratches-by-skipping-grits-glass-sanding/cards/pinterest/avoid-deep-scratches-by-skipping-grits-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/06/avoid-deep-scratches-by-skipping-grits-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/avoid-deep-scratches-by-skipping-grits-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/06/avoid-deep-scratches-by-skipping-grits-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/avoid-deep-scratches-by-skipping-grits-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/06/avoid-deep-scratches-by-skipping-grits-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/avoid-deep-scratches-by-skipping-grits-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Use Soft Interface Pad For Curved Areas</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/04/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/04/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jan 2026 13:34:57 +0000</pubDate><category>Waterproof &amp; Wet/Dry Paper</category><category>grit-280</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-1200</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>orbital sander</category><description>Master curved-surface sanding with soft interface pads and wet dry sandpaper.

&lt;p&gt;The first time you chase a flawless finish across a curving fender, a hand-turned wooden bowl, or the bell of an aluminum bike frame, you learn quickly that flat-surface habits don’t translate. On a crown or complex radius, the surface fights back—edges burn through, pressure spikes leave troughs, and scratches creep in from directions you didn’t intend. The instinct is to push harder or switch to a coarser abrasive; the better move is to refine the contact mechanics. This is where a soft interface pad and properly chosen wet dry sandpaper change the game. Together, they transform an unpredictable contour into a controllable contact patch, preserving geometry while delivering consistent cut and uniform scratch.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/12.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/04/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/04/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/04/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/04/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/instagram/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/04/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/instagram/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/04/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/instagram/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/04/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/04/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/04/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/04/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/04/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/04/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Soft Interface Pad For Contour Sanding</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 13:38:32 +0000</pubDate><category>Hook-and-Loop Discs</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1200</category><description>Engineer-tested guide to soft interface pads for contour sanding and hook and loop sanding discs—materials, heat control, dust, and real-world results.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="hook-and-loop-sanding-discs-and-soft-interface-pads"&gt;Hook and Loop Sanding Discs and Soft Interface Pads&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early Sunday, the shop is quiet except for the soft thrum of a random-orbit sander. You’re easing into the inside radius of a chair arm, the kind of curve where the wood tells on you: one careless second and you’ve burned through stain on the edge. You swap to a softer setup—an interface pad between the pad and your hook and loop sanding discs—and the whole feel changes. The pad yields just enough to keep the abrasive in full contact along the curve, and the sander stops chattering. Your hands relax. The dust stream settles into the vacuum instead of fogging the bench light. The finish doesn’t scream for attention anymore; it whispers that you got the contour right.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/27.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Reduce Polishing Time With Fine Films</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 17 Dec 2025 13:38:35 +0000</pubDate><category>Specialty Abrasives</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-1200</category><category>grit-2000</category><description>Cut polishing time with microfinishing film.

&lt;p&gt;A Sunday evening shop quiets in that special way it does when the last coat finally flashes off. The blade you’ve ground all afternoon catches a line of light on the bench—almost there, but not quite. The scratch from the coarse stage is still telegraphing through, a shallow arc that you can feel more than see. You have two choices: keep chasing it with the same field-worn abrasive, or change the game. This is where microfinishing film earns its keep. With a stable, flat backing and precisely graded minerals, you can push the finish forward predictably instead of gambling time on inconsistent paper or tired belts. That predictability is what shaves hours, not minutes, from a polishing day.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/27.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film/cards/facebook/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film/cards/facebook/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film/cards/facebook/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film/cards/instagram/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film/cards/instagram/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film/cards/instagram/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film/cards/pinterest/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film/cards/pinterest/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film/cards/pinterest/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film/cards/facebook/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film/cards/facebook/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film/cards/facebook/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Open Coat Versus Closed Coat Impacts</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 13:41:49 +0000</pubDate><category>Abrasive Materials &amp; Compounds</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-1200</category><description>Open vs closed coat sanding explained with lab-tested data.

&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning in the shop is supposed to be simple: one mug of coffee, a walnut desktop to final-sand, and a couple of hours of quiet before the house wakes up. Instead, at pass number fifteen, the paper glazes over. The dust lines smear into the grain, and the sander’s pitch changes—a small but telling protest. I switch sheets, still chasing that consistent, haze-free scratch pattern. When I move to wet-sand a lacquer test panel, silicon carbide sandpaper comes out of the drawer—its black grit and smooth backing a distinct contrast to the tan aluminum oxide I’ve used on the walnut. Ten minutes later, I’m flattening a glued-up end-grain cutting board, then stepping over to clean up a steel plane body. Same sander, same operator, but suddenly my results diverge depending on one detail I often overlook: how densely the abrasive grains were packed onto the paper in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/23.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/instagram/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/instagram/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/instagram/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Reduce Chipping With Light Pressure</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 01 Dec 2025 17:57:57 +0000</pubDate><category>Glass &amp; Ceramics Sanding</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-1200</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>Learn glass sanding techniques to prevent chipping.

&lt;p&gt;The first clink is always the loudest. You set the pane on a padded bench, nudge it into square, and that tiny tick of glass on glass makes your shoulders tense. If you’ve worked with glass—bottles you’ve upcycled, aquarium panels you’ve drilled, a mirror you’ve cut—you know the feeling. The fear isn’t shattering; it’s those sneaky micro-chips that show up right when you’re almost done. The good news is we can control them. With glass sanding done right and a feather-light touch, you’ll get clean edges that don’t snowflake into chips, even under stress.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/17.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding/cards/instagram/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding/cards/instagram/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding/cards/instagram/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding/cards/pinterest/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding/cards/pinterest/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding/cards/pinterest/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Choose Tripoli Versus White Rouge For Metal Polishing</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/choose-tripoli-versus-white-rouge-for-metal-polishing-metal-polishing/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/choose-tripoli-versus-white-rouge-for-metal-polishing-metal-polishing/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 23 Nov 2025 13:58:51 +0000</pubDate><category>Metal Polishing &amp; Rust Repair</category><category>grit-1200</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>metal polishing</category><description>Understand Tripoli vs white rouge, choose the right wheel, and build a fast, safe metal polishing workflow for aluminum, brass, and steel.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="tripoli-vs-white-rouge-metal-polishing-guide"&gt;Tripoli vs White Rouge: Metal Polishing Guide&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday light pours across your workbench. The brass cabinet pulls you removed last night look dull, like they’ve filed away years of handprints and turned them matte. Nearby, the stainless kettle you use every morning is fine but not pristine—tiny swirls catch the sun. You set out the tools you have: a bench grinder with buffing wheels, two mystery compound bars—one brown, one white—and a quiet hope that today’s the day your pieces go from “cleaned up” to truly gleaming. If you’ve ever stood in this exact moment, ready to begin but unsure which bar to reach for, you’re not alone. Metal polishing is both craft and sequence, and the right choice at the right time matters.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/08.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/choose-tripoli-versus-white-rouge-for-metal-polishing-metal-polishing/cards/facebook/choose-tripoli-versus-white-rouge-for-metal-polishing-metal-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/choose-tripoli-versus-white-rouge-for-metal-polishing-metal-polishing/cards/facebook/choose-tripoli-versus-white-rouge-for-metal-polishing-metal-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/choose-tripoli-versus-white-rouge-for-metal-polishing-metal-polishing/cards/facebook/choose-tripoli-versus-white-rouge-for-metal-polishing-metal-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/choose-tripoli-versus-white-rouge-for-metal-polishing-metal-polishing/cards/instagram/choose-tripoli-versus-white-rouge-for-metal-polishing-metal-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/choose-tripoli-versus-white-rouge-for-metal-polishing-metal-polishing/cards/instagram/choose-tripoli-versus-white-rouge-for-metal-polishing-metal-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/choose-tripoli-versus-white-rouge-for-metal-polishing-metal-polishing/cards/instagram/choose-tripoli-versus-white-rouge-for-metal-polishing-metal-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/choose-tripoli-versus-white-rouge-for-metal-polishing-metal-polishing/cards/pinterest/choose-tripoli-versus-white-rouge-for-metal-polishing-metal-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/choose-tripoli-versus-white-rouge-for-metal-polishing-metal-polishing/cards/pinterest/choose-tripoli-versus-white-rouge-for-metal-polishing-metal-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/choose-tripoli-versus-white-rouge-for-metal-polishing-metal-polishing/cards/pinterest/choose-tripoli-versus-white-rouge-for-metal-polishing-metal-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/choose-tripoli-versus-white-rouge-for-metal-polishing-metal-polishing/cards/facebook/choose-tripoli-versus-white-rouge-for-metal-polishing-metal-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/choose-tripoli-versus-white-rouge-for-metal-polishing-metal-polishing/cards/facebook/choose-tripoli-versus-white-rouge-for-metal-polishing-metal-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/choose-tripoli-versus-white-rouge-for-metal-polishing-metal-polishing/cards/facebook/choose-tripoli-versus-white-rouge-for-metal-polishing-metal-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Keep Surfaces Wet To Control Heat</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2025 13:37:28 +0000</pubDate><category>Glass &amp; Ceramics Sanding</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-280</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-1200</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>Learn expert glass sanding techniques—why water matters, how to control heat, avoid cracks, and get a flawless edge with safe, practical workshop setups.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="glass-sanding-keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat"&gt;Glass Sanding: Keep Surfaces Wet to Control Heat&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know that afternoon light that hits your workshop just right—sawdust floating like golden confetti, the radio low, a mug ring etched into the bench? That’s where precision starts for me. I remember the first time I tried to smooth a chipped glass shelf salvaged from a vintage cabinet. I treated it like hardwood: dry paper, firm pressure, and a “let’s get this done” pace. Ten minutes in, the edge flashed white, my pad squealed, and the glass pinged with that terrifying, crystalline chatter. I learned fast: glass doesn’t forgive heat. It stores stress the way steel stores spring.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/03.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding/cards/instagram/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding/cards/instagram/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding/cards/instagram/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding/cards/pinterest/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding/cards/pinterest/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding/cards/pinterest/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Remove 1500–2000 Grit Marks On Resin</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 07 Nov 2025 23:56:25 +0000</pubDate><category>Resin Polishing</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-1200</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-2500</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>dust control</category><description>Expert workflows to remove 1500–2000 grit marks on resin and achieve optical clarity with the right abrasives, compounds, and heat control.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="resin-polishing-erasing-15002000-grit-scratches"&gt;Resin Polishing: Erasing 1500–2000 Grit Scratches&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pendant looked flawless on the bench last night—glassy, color suspended in amber, edges softened just so. Then morning light hit it. Under a low-angle window beam, micro-scratches flared across the surface like frost on a windshield. You could feel your shoulders sag. You did the careful wet-sand through 1500 and 2000, kept the strokes even, swirled the slurry away. It should be done. But resin is unforgiving under raking light, and 1500–2000 grit marks hang on, whisper-thin but brutally visible. This is the moment where the craft turns from “sanding” to resin polishing: closing the cut, controlling heat, and stepping the abrasive system with intent until the surface stops being a surface and becomes a reflection.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing/cards/instagram/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing/cards/instagram/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing/cards/instagram/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing/cards/pinterest/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing/cards/pinterest/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing/cards/pinterest/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>9</readingTime></item><item><title>Soap To Water Ratio For Lubrication</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 07 Nov 2025 14:24:10 +0000</pubDate><category>Waterproof &amp; Wet/Dry Paper</category><category>grit-360</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-1200</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-2500</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>sanding block</category><description>Engineer-tested soap-to-water ratios for lubricating wet dry sandpaper on paint, wood, and metal.

&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning, a quiet garage, and a project you’ve promised yourself you’d finally finish. The headlight lenses are foggy. The table top has those telltale dust nibs in the polyurethane. A chef’s knife hangs dull on the magnetic strip, begging for bite. You fill a bucket, reach for a bottle of soap, and lay out sheets of wet dry sandpaper—ready to get to work. And then you pause. How much soap should actually go into the water? One drop? A teaspoon? More? You’ve heard “soapy water helps it glide,” but glide isn’t the only variable that matters. There’s also bite, swarf transport, scratch control, and heat. The soap-to-water ratio dictates whether you refine fast and clean—or skate on a film that kills cutting speed and blurs feedback.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/instagram/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/instagram/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/instagram/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Best Wet Sanding Sequence For Plastic Headlight Lenses</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 05 Nov 2025 03:51:43 +0000</pubDate><category>Headlight Restoration</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-1200</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-2500</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>A precise, technical guide to wet lens sanding for plastic headlights—abrasives, workflows, and UV protection to restore clear, durable optics.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="best-lens-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlights"&gt;Best Lens Sanding Sequence for Plastic Headlights&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twilight is the worst time to discover your headlights are lying to you. Streetlights smear into blurry halos; lane markers fade into a matte wash. You feel yourself leaning forward in the seat as if posture could coax more lumens from the housings. But the problem isn’t the bulb; it’s the lens. Polycarbonate oxidizes, turns porous, and grows a diffuse surface that scatters light instead of transmitting it. That’s fixable if you stop thinking of restoration as a wipe-on miracle and start treating it like precision surface engineering. This guide is about real lens sanding—structured, wet, and sequential—not guessing with a single pad until it “looks better.”&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding/cards/facebook/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding/cards/facebook/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding/cards/facebook/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding/cards/instagram/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding/cards/instagram/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding/cards/instagram/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding/cards/pinterest/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding/cards/pinterest/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding/cards/pinterest/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding/cards/facebook/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding/cards/facebook/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding/cards/facebook/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Use Diamond Or Sic For Glass Edges</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 23:29:24 +0000</pubDate><category>Glass &amp; Ceramics Sanding</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-280</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1200</category><category>grit-2500</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>wet sanding</category><description>Technical guide to glass sanding for chip‑free edges using diamond or SiC abrasives, with grit sequences, coolant control, and polishing workflows.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="glass-sanding-for-clean-safe-edges-diamond-vs-sic"&gt;Glass sanding for clean, safe edges: diamond vs SiC&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The moment you lift a freshly cut pane, you feel it: the edge that looks fine from arm’s length but carries invisible threats—micro-chips, stress risers, and the slight granular drag under a fingertip that says the finish is not ready for handling. Anyone who has ever fit a glass shelf, framed a museum-grade print, or repurposed a bottle knows that the edge is where projects succeed or fail. That’s where glass sanding earns its keep. Thoughtful abrasive selection and disciplined technique turn a risky raw cut into a safe, optically clean edge that won’t shed fragments, haze, or propagate cracks under load. Whether you’re tuning a small arris for furniture-grade touch or chasing an optical polish on a laminated panel, the goal is the same: remove damage quickly, control heat, and leave a tight subsurface that won’t surprise you months later.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding/cards/instagram/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding/cards/instagram/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding/cards/instagram/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding/cards/pinterest/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding/cards/pinterest/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding/cards/pinterest/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>14</readingTime></item><item><title>Soak Time For Wet Sanding Papers</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 19:47:57 +0000</pubDate><category>Waterproof &amp; Wet/Dry Paper</category><category>grit-280</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-1200</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>wet sanding</category><description>Learn the optimal soak times for wet dry sandpaper, how soaking affects abrasive performance, and precise workflows for wood, paint, and metal.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="wet-dry-sandpaper-soak-times-a-technical-guide"&gt;Wet Dry Sandpaper Soak Times: A Technical Guide&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shop is quiet except for the slow drip from a rinse bottle, pooling across a workbench where a clear-coated guitar body breathes under the lights. There’s a shallow tray of clean water, a few folded sheets of wet dry sandpaper, and a foam pad waiting like a promise. You press a fingertip to the lacquer—weeks of curing have left it hard, crisp, and unforgiving. You remember the last time you rushed the process and chased pigtails under a glaring shop light. Not today. Today, the water will do its work before the first stroke lands.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/instagram/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/instagram/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/instagram/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Difference Between Compounding And Polishing</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 02:16:29 +0000</pubDate><category>Polishing &amp; Finishing</category><category>mirror finish</category><category>polishing pads</category><category>grit progression</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-1200</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>clear coat</category><description>Learn the difference between compounding and polishing, how to choose polishing sandpaper and pads, and the step-by-step process for flawless finishes.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="compounding-vs-polishing-guide-to-polishing-sandpaper"&gt;Compounding vs Polishing: Guide to Polishing Sandpaper&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a moment every craftsperson recognizes: you step into the garage or studio, sunlight cuts across a painted panel or tabletop, and you see everything—swirls you never meant to leave, scratches that catch the light just so, a haze that dulls the color you spent hours applying. Your instinct might be to reach for the strongest product you own, but knowing the difference between compounding and polishing—and where polishing sandpaper fits—can save time, material, and the finish you’re trying to protect. Maybe it’s the clear coat on your daily driver, the lacquer on a guitar body, or the resin on a turned pen blank. Different surfaces, same goal: remove defects while preserving as much material as possible.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper/cards/instagram/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper/cards/instagram/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper/cards/instagram/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item></channel></rss>

&lt;p&gt;The afternoon light hit the hallway just right—the kind of slant that makes crisp edges glow and tiny flaws stand out like little shadows. The old crown molding you’d decided to keep (and just refresh) looked less romantic up close: nicks where movers grazed it, soft ridges from past paint jobs, and a few dips where a power sander had been a touch too enthusiastic. You ran a fingertip along the ogee, felt a wave where a clean curve should be, and realized this was not a job for brute force. It was a job for patience and precision. If you’ve tried molding sanding before, you know the paradox: the more you try to fix a profile, the easier it is to flatten it.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/13.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/12/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding/cards/facebook/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/12/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding/cards/facebook/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/12/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding/cards/facebook/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/12/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding/cards/instagram/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/12/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding/cards/instagram/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/12/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding/cards/instagram/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/12/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding/cards/pinterest/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/12/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding/cards/pinterest/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/12/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding/cards/pinterest/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/12/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding/cards/facebook/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/12/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding/cards/facebook/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/12/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding/cards/facebook/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Fix Dents And White Rings Before Applying New Finish</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 15:12:04 +0000</pubDate><category>Furniture Refinishing</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>sanding block</category><category>clear coat</category><category>dust control</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Learn how to fix dents and white rings before applying a new finish.

&lt;p&gt;Saturday light hits the dining table just right, and that’s both a blessing and a curse. You can see everything: the tiny crater where a laptop corner sank into soft oak during a late-night email sprint, the ghostly white ring from a forgotten coffee mug, the faint scratch where a science project met an impatient sponge. These are the little scars of a life well-lived—until you decide it’s time to refinish. As a workshop guy who lives for clean joins, crisp edges, and silky finishes, I’ve learned that great furniture restoration lives or dies before you ever open a finish can. If you don’t fix dents and lift white rings properly, your “new finish” just spotlights old mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/11.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration/cards/facebook/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration/cards/facebook/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration/cards/facebook/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration/cards/instagram/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration/cards/instagram/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration/cards/instagram/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration/cards/pinterest/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration/cards/pinterest/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration/cards/pinterest/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration/cards/facebook/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration/cards/facebook/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration/cards/facebook/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Coating Tech To Reduce Heat And Clogging</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/10/coating-tech-to-reduce-heat-and-clogging-abrasive-testing/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/10/coating-tech-to-reduce-heat-and-clogging-abrasive-testing/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 15:28:04 +0000</pubDate><category>Abrasive Innovation &amp; Testing</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>paint prep</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Learn how coating technologies and abrasive testing reduce heat, prevent loading, and optimize sanding workflows for cleaner, faster surface prep.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="abrasive-testing-coatings-to-cut-heat-and-clogging"&gt;Abrasive Testing: Coatings to Cut Heat and Clogging&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The day starts cool, but the shop heats fast. You tape off a panel and power up the 5&amp;quot; random orbital. Within minutes, the disc is skating, resin smears streak the surface, and the pad feels hot enough to warp a finger pad. The clock is merciless. This is the moment where small choices—grain chemistry, topcoat, vacuum pattern—decide whether you flow into primer by lunch or spend the afternoon digging spent discs out of a bin. Heat and loading aren’t just nuisances; they are the leading indicators that your abrasives and process aren’t matched to the substrate, the geometry, or the dust load. That’s exactly where disciplined abrasive testing earns its keep: quantifying cut rates, temperature, and load-up so you can select coatings that stay cool and resist clogging right up to the finishing pass.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/07.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/10/coating-tech-to-reduce-heat-and-clogging-abrasive-testing/cards/facebook/coating-tech-to-reduce-heat-and-clogging-abrasive-testing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/10/coating-tech-to-reduce-heat-and-clogging-abrasive-testing/cards/facebook/coating-tech-to-reduce-heat-and-clogging-abrasive-testing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/10/coating-tech-to-reduce-heat-and-clogging-abrasive-testing/cards/facebook/coating-tech-to-reduce-heat-and-clogging-abrasive-testing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/10/coating-tech-to-reduce-heat-and-clogging-abrasive-testing/cards/instagram/coating-tech-to-reduce-heat-and-clogging-abrasive-testing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/10/coating-tech-to-reduce-heat-and-clogging-abrasive-testing/cards/instagram/coating-tech-to-reduce-heat-and-clogging-abrasive-testing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/10/coating-tech-to-reduce-heat-and-clogging-abrasive-testing/cards/instagram/coating-tech-to-reduce-heat-and-clogging-abrasive-testing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/10/coating-tech-to-reduce-heat-and-clogging-abrasive-testing/cards/pinterest/coating-tech-to-reduce-heat-and-clogging-abrasive-testing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/10/coating-tech-to-reduce-heat-and-clogging-abrasive-testing/cards/pinterest/coating-tech-to-reduce-heat-and-clogging-abrasive-testing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/10/coating-tech-to-reduce-heat-and-clogging-abrasive-testing/cards/pinterest/coating-tech-to-reduce-heat-and-clogging-abrasive-testing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/10/coating-tech-to-reduce-heat-and-clogging-abrasive-testing/cards/facebook/coating-tech-to-reduce-heat-and-clogging-abrasive-testing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/10/coating-tech-to-reduce-heat-and-clogging-abrasive-testing/cards/facebook/coating-tech-to-reduce-heat-and-clogging-abrasive-testing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/10/coating-tech-to-reduce-heat-and-clogging-abrasive-testing/cards/facebook/coating-tech-to-reduce-heat-and-clogging-abrasive-testing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Check Flatness Before Higher Grits</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/07/check-flatness-before-higher-grits-concrete-polishing/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/07/check-flatness-before-higher-grits-concrete-polishing/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 13:45:51 +0000</pubDate><category>Stone &amp; Concrete Polishing</category><category>grit-200</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit progression</category><category>mirror finish</category><description>Master concrete polishing with pro steps to verify flatness before climbing grits.

&lt;p&gt;The first time I chased a mirror finish on a tired garage slab, I thought more passes and higher grits would solve everything. The grinder hummed, the vacuum roared, and the floor looked decent—until late afternoon sun spilled across it and exposed a field of faint troughs and ghost scratches. You know that sinking feeling: you’ve already climbed to 400 grit and realize the slab isn’t flat enough to carry a true reflection. That’s the money-losing moment in concrete polishing—when you’re forced to drop back down, rework the metal steps, and eat the day.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/24.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/07/check-flatness-before-higher-grits-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/check-flatness-before-higher-grits-concrete-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/07/check-flatness-before-higher-grits-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/check-flatness-before-higher-grits-concrete-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/07/check-flatness-before-higher-grits-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/check-flatness-before-higher-grits-concrete-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/07/check-flatness-before-higher-grits-concrete-polishing/cards/instagram/check-flatness-before-higher-grits-concrete-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/07/check-flatness-before-higher-grits-concrete-polishing/cards/instagram/check-flatness-before-higher-grits-concrete-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/07/check-flatness-before-higher-grits-concrete-polishing/cards/instagram/check-flatness-before-higher-grits-concrete-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/07/check-flatness-before-higher-grits-concrete-polishing/cards/pinterest/check-flatness-before-higher-grits-concrete-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/07/check-flatness-before-higher-grits-concrete-polishing/cards/pinterest/check-flatness-before-higher-grits-concrete-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/07/check-flatness-before-higher-grits-concrete-polishing/cards/pinterest/check-flatness-before-higher-grits-concrete-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/07/check-flatness-before-higher-grits-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/check-flatness-before-higher-grits-concrete-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/07/check-flatness-before-higher-grits-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/check-flatness-before-higher-grits-concrete-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/07/check-flatness-before-higher-grits-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/check-flatness-before-higher-grits-concrete-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Use Soft Interface Pad For Curved Areas</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/04/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/04/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jan 2026 13:34:57 +0000</pubDate><category>Waterproof &amp; Wet/Dry Paper</category><category>grit-280</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-1200</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>orbital sander</category><description>Master curved-surface sanding with soft interface pads and wet dry sandpaper.

&lt;p&gt;The first time you chase a flawless finish across a curving fender, a hand-turned wooden bowl, or the bell of an aluminum bike frame, you learn quickly that flat-surface habits don’t translate. On a crown or complex radius, the surface fights back—edges burn through, pressure spikes leave troughs, and scratches creep in from directions you didn’t intend. The instinct is to push harder or switch to a coarser abrasive; the better move is to refine the contact mechanics. This is where a soft interface pad and properly chosen wet dry sandpaper change the game. Together, they transform an unpredictable contour into a controllable contact patch, preserving geometry while delivering consistent cut and uniform scratch.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/12.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/04/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/04/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/04/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/04/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/instagram/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/04/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/instagram/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/04/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/instagram/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/04/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/04/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/04/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/04/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/04/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/04/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Film Backed Ceramics For Uniform Scratch</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jan 2026 15:06:46 +0000</pubDate><category>Ceramic &amp; Premium Abrasives</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-280</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>dust control</category><category>clear coat</category><description>Learn how film-backed ceramic sanding discs deliver a uniform scratch pattern with better cut and control.

&lt;p&gt;You notice it first in the light. That telltale halo that appears when you shift the panel under a shop lamp, the swirl that refuses to quit even after another pass with the sander. Maybe it’s a cabinet door you’ve been nursing back to life, a car fender in primer that has to be perfect for color, or a guitar body on its third clear coat. You’re not chasing shine yet—you’re chasing uniformity. A clean, even scratch pattern is the quiet foundation of every flawless finish, and when it isn’t there, everything downstream becomes harder: filler prints through, paint mottles, topcoats telegraph the tiniest inconsistencies. The solution often starts earlier than we think—at the abrasive itself.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/10.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Edge And Profile Grit Selection</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jan 2026 13:34:23 +0000</pubDate><category>Grit Range &amp; Classification</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-101</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-280</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><description>Learn to pick the right sandpaper grit for edges and profiles.

&lt;p&gt;It starts with the first swipe on a sharp, splintery edge—maybe the oak tabletop you rescued, the cabinet door frame you’re painting for a bathroom refresh, or the picture frame for a gift that’s due tonight. In the quiet of the workshop, dust hangs in the light and you feel the edge transform under your fingers. The urge is to “just sand it” and keep going. But edges and profiles aren’t flat panels; they magnify every mistake. Round over too far and the joint line disappears. Skip a grit and scratch ghosts show up in the finish. Choose the wrong sandpaper grit and you’ll waste time or, worse, bruise a delicate profile you spent hours cutting.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/08.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit/cards/instagram/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit/cards/instagram/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit/cards/instagram/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit/cards/pinterest/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit/cards/pinterest/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit/cards/pinterest/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Soft Interface Pad For Contour Sanding</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 13:38:32 +0000</pubDate><category>Hook-and-Loop Discs</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1200</category><description>Engineer-tested guide to soft interface pads for contour sanding and hook and loop sanding discs—materials, heat control, dust, and real-world results.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="hook-and-loop-sanding-discs-and-soft-interface-pads"&gt;Hook and Loop Sanding Discs and Soft Interface Pads&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early Sunday, the shop is quiet except for the soft thrum of a random-orbit sander. You’re easing into the inside radius of a chair arm, the kind of curve where the wood tells on you: one careless second and you’ve burned through stain on the edge. You swap to a softer setup—an interface pad between the pad and your hook and loop sanding discs—and the whole feel changes. The pad yields just enough to keep the abrasive in full contact along the curve, and the sander stops chattering. Your hands relax. The dust stream settles into the vacuum instead of fogging the bench light. The finish doesn’t scream for attention anymore; it whispers that you got the contour right.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/27.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Sequence Grits For Profiles And Corners</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 14:25:34 +0000</pubDate><category>Detail Sander Sheets</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><description>Engineer’s guide to sequencing grits for profiles and corners with detail sander sheets, including test-backed grit orders and pro tips for crisp edges</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="detail-sander-sheets-sequencing-grits-for-profiles"&gt;Detail sander sheets: sequencing grits for profiles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a Saturday morning in the shop, you pull the tape off a freshly routed maple picture frame and hit it with raking light. The ogee looks clean at first glance—but your fingertips catch tiny ridges where the cutter eased in and out, and the inside corners still show faint milling lines. You grab a delta sander, slide on a fresh pack of detail sander sheets, and take a breath. This is the moment that separates a merely “good enough” piece from one that reads crisp at arm’s length and holds up under a client’s inspection light.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/19.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets/cards/instagram/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets/cards/instagram/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets/cards/instagram/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets/cards/pinterest/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets/cards/pinterest/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets/cards/pinterest/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>13</readingTime></item><item><title>Avoid Cutting Through Color Coats When Sanding Between</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/29/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/29/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 13:42:54 +0000</pubDate><category>Between-Coats Sanding</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>clear coat</category><category>grit progression</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>Avoid sand-through on stained or painted projects.

&lt;p&gt;The first time I cut through a beautifully shaded guitar body, it was 11:30 p.m. in a quiet shop. The color was perfect—warm amber base, a gentle burst on the edges, and just enough depth to make the figure dance. I’d laid down two clear coats, feeling confident, and went in for a “quick scuff” before the third. Ten strokes in, the block slipped off a radius and I saw it: a pale witness line peeking through the color, a little halo of heartbreak. If you’ve ever felt that knot in your gut, you know that between coats sanding can make or break a project.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/13.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/29/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/29/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/29/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/29/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding/cards/instagram/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/29/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding/cards/instagram/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/29/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding/cards/instagram/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/29/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding/cards/pinterest/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/29/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding/cards/pinterest/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/29/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding/cards/pinterest/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/29/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/29/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/29/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Recommended Grit Sequence For Sanding Bare Steel</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/27/recommended-grit-sequence-for-sanding-bare-steel-metal-surface-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/27/recommended-grit-sequence-for-sanding-bare-steel-metal-surface-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 27 Dec 2025 14:21:03 +0000</pubDate><category>Metal Polishing &amp; Rust Repair</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Learn the optimal grit sequence for sanding bare steel, with tooling, abrasives, and workflow guidance to maximize adhesion and finish quality.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="metal-surface-sanding-grit-sequence-for-bare-steel"&gt;Metal surface sanding: grit sequence for bare steel&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You notice it the moment the sander spins down: the hush after the rasp of grit on steel, the faint warmth still in the panel, the tiny constellation of scratch lines all pointing the same way. On Friday night, this fender looked tired—speckled with scale, a wisp of old primer clinging at the edges. Saturday morning it’s a blank canvas in progress, the steel alive again under clean, uniform scratch. Anyone who’s spent a weekend restoring a motorcycle tank or prepping a truck’s rocker knows the difference between “sanded” and “ready.” Metal surface sanding isn’t about making things shiny; it’s about engineering a surface profile that bonds mechanically with the next layer—primer, filler, sealer—without undercutting the geometry or telegraphing flaws. It’s a craft and a sequence, not just a tool choice.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/09.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/27/recommended-grit-sequence-for-sanding-bare-steel-metal-surface-sanding/cards/facebook/recommended-grit-sequence-for-sanding-bare-steel-metal-surface-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/27/recommended-grit-sequence-for-sanding-bare-steel-metal-surface-sanding/cards/facebook/recommended-grit-sequence-for-sanding-bare-steel-metal-surface-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/27/recommended-grit-sequence-for-sanding-bare-steel-metal-surface-sanding/cards/facebook/recommended-grit-sequence-for-sanding-bare-steel-metal-surface-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/27/recommended-grit-sequence-for-sanding-bare-steel-metal-surface-sanding/cards/instagram/recommended-grit-sequence-for-sanding-bare-steel-metal-surface-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/27/recommended-grit-sequence-for-sanding-bare-steel-metal-surface-sanding/cards/instagram/recommended-grit-sequence-for-sanding-bare-steel-metal-surface-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/27/recommended-grit-sequence-for-sanding-bare-steel-metal-surface-sanding/cards/instagram/recommended-grit-sequence-for-sanding-bare-steel-metal-surface-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/27/recommended-grit-sequence-for-sanding-bare-steel-metal-surface-sanding/cards/pinterest/recommended-grit-sequence-for-sanding-bare-steel-metal-surface-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/27/recommended-grit-sequence-for-sanding-bare-steel-metal-surface-sanding/cards/pinterest/recommended-grit-sequence-for-sanding-bare-steel-metal-surface-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/27/recommended-grit-sequence-for-sanding-bare-steel-metal-surface-sanding/cards/pinterest/recommended-grit-sequence-for-sanding-bare-steel-metal-surface-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/27/recommended-grit-sequence-for-sanding-bare-steel-metal-surface-sanding/cards/facebook/recommended-grit-sequence-for-sanding-bare-steel-metal-surface-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/27/recommended-grit-sequence-for-sanding-bare-steel-metal-surface-sanding/cards/facebook/recommended-grit-sequence-for-sanding-bare-steel-metal-surface-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/27/recommended-grit-sequence-for-sanding-bare-steel-metal-surface-sanding/cards/facebook/recommended-grit-sequence-for-sanding-bare-steel-metal-surface-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Da Sander Versus Random Orbital For Bodywork Preparation</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/25/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/25/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 13:37:54 +0000</pubDate><category>Auto Body Sanding</category><category>grit-40</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>orbital sander</category><description>Engineering review of DA vs RO sanding for car bodywork, with test data on removal rates, finish quality, abrasives, and cost to help you prep panels right.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="da-vs-ro-sanding-for-auto-bodywork-prep"&gt;DA vs RO sanding for Auto Bodywork Prep&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a cool Saturday morning, I wheeled a dented fender onto the stand, grabbed coffee, and stared at two sanders: a pneumatic 6-inch “DA” hanging from the air line, and a compact 5-inch corded random orbital sitting on the bench. The car—an aging hatchback—had a blend of bare metal, polyester filler, and feathered edges where clearcoat met primer. This is the exact moment many DIYers and even pros face: DA vs RO sanding for bodywork prep. You’re not choosing a philosophy; you’re choosing a process that affects dust control, scratch depth, shape fidelity, and the time you’ll spend chasing pigtails or re-spraying primer. I’ve felt the allure of the faster-cutting DA when leveling filler, and I’ve also learned the hard way that an aggressive orbit can tunnel through primer on a convex edge in seconds.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/03.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/25/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding/cards/facebook/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/25/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding/cards/facebook/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/25/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding/cards/facebook/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/25/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding/cards/instagram/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/25/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding/cards/instagram/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/25/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding/cards/instagram/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/25/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding/cards/pinterest/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/25/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding/cards/pinterest/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/25/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding/cards/pinterest/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/25/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding/cards/facebook/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/25/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding/cards/facebook/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/25/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding/cards/facebook/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>How To Scuff Sand Glossy Trim For Better Adhesion</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/23/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/23/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 14:56:24 +0000</pubDate><category>Trim &amp; Molding Sanding</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-360</category><category>grit-400</category><category>dust control</category><category>sanding block</category><description>Learn expert scuff-sanding techniques for glossy trim so paint sticks flawlessly.

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve ever run your fingers along a glossy window casing and thought, “There’s no way paint will stick to this,” you’re right—at least not for long without the right prep. I’ve walked into plenty of homes where a beautifully painted room is betrayed by peeling, nicked baseboards and door frames. The culprit is almost always the same: slippery, factory-smooth or oil-painted trim with zero mechanical bite. This is where trim sanding earns its keep. Done right, scuff sanding turns that slick plastic-like surface into a paint-friendly foundation that your primer and topcoat can lock onto.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/26.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/23/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/23/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/23/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/23/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding/cards/instagram/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/23/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding/cards/instagram/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/23/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding/cards/instagram/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/23/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/23/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/23/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/23/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/23/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/23/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Price Versus Performance Over Time</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 20 Dec 2025 14:25:50 +0000</pubDate><category>Brand &amp; Quality Comparison</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><description>A technical guide to selecting the best sandpaper brand for long-term value—cut rate, lifespan, surface quality, and workflow efficiency.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="choosing-the-best-sandpaper-brand-for-long-term-value"&gt;Choosing the best sandpaper brand for long-term value&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning, the shop is quiet except for the steady whirr of a 5-inch random-orbit sander. You watch the dust plume flatten as the extractor spools up, then feel the pad settle onto a maple panel you’ve jointed and planed true. The first passes feel crisp—rapid cut, clean scratch pattern, no chatter. Then the feedback shifts. Heat creeps in. The pad skates slightly, cutting less and loading more. You flip the disc, glance at the resin smear, and do the quick math we all do when we care about price versus performance over time: how many panels per disc, and what did it actually cost to get this surface ready for finish? This is why the question of the best sandpaper brand is never just about brand—it’s about measurable throughput, surface quality, and the total cost of consistency.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/14.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/facebook/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/facebook/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/facebook/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/instagram/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/instagram/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/instagram/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/pinterest/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/pinterest/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/pinterest/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/facebook/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/facebook/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/facebook/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Film Versus Paper Backing With Grains</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 17:25:57 +0000</pubDate><category>Abrasive Materials &amp; Compounds</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><description>Film vs paper sandpaper backings explained with grain choices like silicon carbide, plus pro tips for wet/dry sanding and flawless finishes.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="film-vs-paper-backing-with-silicon-carbide-sandpaper"&gt;Film vs Paper Backing with Silicon Carbide Sandpaper&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday mornings in the shop start the same for me: kettle on, soft sun across the bench, and a project at that satisfying almost-there stage. I’d been chasing a glass-flat finish on a walnut desk with an epoxy river, and the last pass was fighting me—tiny swirls that only showed in raking light. I’d been sanding wet to keep dust down, but the paper kept going mushy at the edges. That’s when I swapped in film-backed silicon carbide sandpaper I’d stashed for auto body work. The difference was immediate: the sheet kept its shape, water beaded and carried the swarf away, and the scratch pattern evened out in a few clean passes. The surface went quiet—no chatter, just controlled cutting.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/10.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/instagram/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/instagram/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/instagram/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Keep Heat Low To Prevent Softening</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 17 Dec 2025 14:27:08 +0000</pubDate><category>Plastic &amp; Epoxy Sanding</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>wet sanding</category><description>Engineer-tested guide to epoxy sanding without softening.

&lt;p&gt;The room is quiet except for the soft whirr of a 5-inch random orbital sander. You’ve invested hours pouring a resin river through a slab of maple, watched the swirl of pigment lock under crystal clarity, and now you’re finally leveling the surface for that glass-smooth finish. Then it happens—under the pad, the epoxy feels different. The sander drags, the dust turns to smeary ribbons, and the finish dulls into a gummy haze. If you’ve experienced that sinking feeling, you’ve already met the enemy of precision finishing: heat buildup.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/29.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding/cards/instagram/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding/cards/instagram/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding/cards/instagram/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding/cards/pinterest/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding/cards/pinterest/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding/cards/pinterest/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>When To Drop Back A Grit To Fix Defects</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/15/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/15/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 15 Dec 2025 13:46:21 +0000</pubDate><category>Grit Range &amp; Classification</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><description>Practical rules and tests to know when to drop back sandpaper grit to remove defects without over-sanding, from wood and resin to automotive clear coat.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="when-to-drop-back-sandpaper-grit-to-fix-defects"&gt;When to Drop Back Sandpaper Grit to Fix Defects&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning. Coffee cooling on the bench, raking light cutting across your project like a truth serum. You wanted a quick scuff-and-recoat—thirty minutes, tops. Instead, the panel keeps whispering back at you: that line near the edge, the mysterious dull patch that won’t clear, the faint spiral that appears only at a certain angle. You switch sheets, then pressure, then motion, but the micro-scratches stubbornly telegraph through. It’s the universal moment where your patience meets physics: do you keep climbing up the sequence or drop back a sandpaper grit to reset the scratch pattern?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/21.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/15/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/15/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/15/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/15/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit/cards/instagram/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/15/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit/cards/instagram/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/15/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit/cards/instagram/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/15/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit/cards/pinterest/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/15/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit/cards/pinterest/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/15/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit/cards/pinterest/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/15/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/15/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/15/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Best Grits For Leveling Primer</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 12 Dec 2025 14:45:24 +0000</pubDate><category>PSA Discs</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-500</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>clear coat</category><category>wet sanding</category><description>Engineer-tested guide to the best grits for leveling primer.

&lt;p&gt;Saturday mornings in my garage start with coffee, a quiet radio, and a panel that still holds a map of yesterday’s imperfections. The primer is flat gray, but under a raking light you can read it like topography—little ridges around a dent repair, faint peel from a heavy pass, and that one shallow wave you only see when you step back. I’ve learned that this is where the paint job is actually won or lost, not in the clear coat. And the tools matter: the block, the sander orbit, the mineral in the abrasive, even the adhesive that bonds the disc. When I swapped to psa sanding discs on a rigid interface for the first “leveling” cut, I noticed two things right away—straighter panels and fewer surprises after sealer.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/13.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Tack Cloth And Vacuum Steps After Scuff Sanding</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 17:33:26 +0000</pubDate><category>Between-Coats Sanding</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>dust control</category><category>clear coat</category><description>Engineer-tested steps for between coats sanding: how to vacuum, tack, and scuff for flawless finishes without dust nibs or witness lines.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="between-coats-sanding-with-tack-cloth-and-vacuum"&gt;Between Coats Sanding with Tack Cloth and Vacuum&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first time I cared about finish quality was on a cold Saturday, kneeling on a drop cloth, cradling a cabinet door that looked perfect—until light from the window slid across it. That raking beam turned gentle amber into a topography of dust nibs, witness lines, and a faint, scratchy haze. I’d rushed the cleaning between scuff passes and relied on a single wipe with an old T‑shirt. The result was predictable in hindsight: dust trapped in clear coat, uneven adhesion, and a finish that only looked good under dim light. That afternoon I learned what every disciplined finisher knows: between coats sanding isn’t about aggression—it’s about control.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/26.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding/cards/instagram/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding/cards/instagram/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding/cards/instagram/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding/cards/pinterest/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding/cards/pinterest/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding/cards/pinterest/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Grind Out Rust And Feather Edges For Patch Repair</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 14:44:40 +0000</pubDate><category>Metal Polishing &amp; Rust Repair</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>rust removal</category><description>Learn rust repair the right way: grind out corrosion, feather paint edges, and patch cleanly for durable, near-invisible automotive fixes.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="rust-repair-101-grind-feather-and-patch-like-pro"&gt;Rust Repair 101: Grind, Feather, and Patch Like Pro&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The moment you notice it is rarely dramatic. Maybe you’re pouring your first cup of coffee, the driveway still cool in the morning shade, when a small bubble on the wheel arch catches your eye. It wasn’t there last summer. You press lightly; the paint flexes and flattens like a blister. It’s a tiny flaw, easy to ignore while the engine warms and the day rushes in. But you know how rust works. It doesn’t wait. It keeps chewing, one quiet day after another, under glossy paint where you can’t see it.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/22.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair/cards/facebook/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair/cards/facebook/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair/cards/facebook/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair/cards/instagram/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair/cards/instagram/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair/cards/instagram/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair/cards/pinterest/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair/cards/pinterest/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair/cards/pinterest/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair/cards/facebook/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair/cards/facebook/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair/cards/facebook/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Apply Dry Guide Coat Evenly Over Primer Before Blocking</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2025 13:40:28 +0000</pubDate><category>Auto Body Sanding</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-500</category><category>grit-600</category><category>dust control</category><description>Learn how to apply a dry guide coat evenly over primer and block panels with precision.

&lt;p&gt;The shop is quiet except for the hiss of air through a regulator and the faint tick of cooling metal. You’ve just laid down a uniform film of high-build primer on a long quarter panel, the kind with a subtle crown that punishes any lapse in technique. Under raking LEDs, the surface looks good—flat at a glance, gray and matte like it should. But you know better. Until you perform disciplined guide coat sanding, there’s no honest way to read the surface. The panel has its history: tap-down marks from the last round of metalwork, a skim of filler you were careful not to overshape, and a featheredge that transitions into OEM finish along the dogleg. If any area is slightly low, the topcoat will amplify it like a megaphone.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/16.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding/cards/facebook/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding/cards/facebook/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding/cards/facebook/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding/cards/instagram/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding/cards/instagram/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding/cards/instagram/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding/cards/pinterest/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding/cards/pinterest/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding/cards/pinterest/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding/cards/facebook/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding/cards/facebook/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding/cards/facebook/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>13</readingTime></item><item><title>Wrap Sandpaper Around Dowels For Curved Edges</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 05 Dec 2025 13:37:54 +0000</pubDate><category>Hand Sanding Techniques</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Practical guide to hand sanding curved edges by wrapping sandpaper around dowels; testing abrasives, grits, and jigs for consistent radii.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="hand-sanding-curves-wrap-paper-around-dowels"&gt;Hand Sanding Curves: Wrap Paper Around Dowels&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember the first time a curve made me question my craft. It was a walnut keepsake box with a lid that looked perfect on CAD: a soft 10 mm radius running cleanly along all four edges. On the bench, though, the radius fought back. My block sander flattened the apex, my random-orbit sander skated off the edge, and every “shortcut” I tried left flats and chatter marks that showed up under finish like neon. I finally reached for the simplest tool in the shop: a hardwood dowel, a strip of abrasive, and my hands. With careful hand sanding—wrapping the paper around a dowel that matched the profile—the radius began to read as a continuous curve instead of a sequence of mistakes. The tactile feedback told me where the high spots were; the scratch pattern told me when I was pushing too hard.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/02.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding/cards/instagram/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding/cards/instagram/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding/cards/instagram/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding/cards/pinterest/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding/cards/pinterest/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding/cards/pinterest/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Reusable Sponges To Reduce Waste</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 17:37:43 +0000</pubDate><category>Eco &amp; Non-Toxic Abrasives</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>dry sanding</category><category>paint prep</category><category>dust control</category><category>joint compound</category><description>Expert guide to eco sandpaper and reusable sponges: prep, grit strategy, cleaning cycles, and workflows that reduce waste without compromising finish.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="eco-sandpaper-and-reusable-sanding-sponges"&gt;Eco sandpaper and reusable sanding sponges&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a Saturday morning, I stood over a maple desk that had seen too many years of coffee rings and hurried notes. The sun cut across the shop floor, catching dust motes suspended in a quiet orbit around the project that would—if I did this right—become an heirloom. Next to me sat a half-empty box of worn paper sheets and a small pile of discarded grits I’d promised myself I’d send to recycling (a promise I rarely kept). It felt familiar and a little defeating: endless sheets, clogged in minutes, and a small mountain of waste. That was the morning I switched the workflow, integrating reusable sanding sponges and eco sandpaper into a process designed not just for finish quality, but for sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/29.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper/cards/instagram/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper/cards/instagram/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper/cards/instagram/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Open Coat Versus Closed Coat Impacts</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 13:41:49 +0000</pubDate><category>Abrasive Materials &amp; Compounds</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-1200</category><description>Open vs closed coat sanding explained with lab-tested data.

&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning in the shop is supposed to be simple: one mug of coffee, a walnut desktop to final-sand, and a couple of hours of quiet before the house wakes up. Instead, at pass number fifteen, the paper glazes over. The dust lines smear into the grain, and the sander’s pitch changes—a small but telling protest. I switch sheets, still chasing that consistent, haze-free scratch pattern. When I move to wet-sand a lacquer test panel, silicon carbide sandpaper comes out of the drawer—its black grit and smooth backing a distinct contrast to the tan aluminum oxide I’ve used on the walnut. Ten minutes later, I’m flattening a glued-up end-grain cutting board, then stepping over to clean up a steel plane body. Same sander, same operator, but suddenly my results diverge depending on one detail I often overlook: how densely the abrasive grains were packed onto the paper in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/23.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/instagram/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/instagram/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/instagram/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Reduce Chipping With Light Pressure</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 01 Dec 2025 17:57:57 +0000</pubDate><category>Glass &amp; Ceramics Sanding</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-1200</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>Learn glass sanding techniques to prevent chipping.

&lt;p&gt;The first clink is always the loudest. You set the pane on a padded bench, nudge it into square, and that tiny tick of glass on glass makes your shoulders tense. If you’ve worked with glass—bottles you’ve upcycled, aquarium panels you’ve drilled, a mirror you’ve cut—you know the feeling. The fear isn’t shattering; it’s those sneaky micro-chips that show up right when you’re almost done. The good news is we can control them. With glass sanding done right and a feather-light touch, you’ll get clean edges that don’t snowflake into chips, even under stress.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/17.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding/cards/instagram/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding/cards/instagram/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding/cards/instagram/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding/cards/pinterest/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding/cards/pinterest/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding/cards/pinterest/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>When To Choose Trizact Style Abrasives</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 01 Dec 2025 13:40:34 +0000</pubDate><category>Specialty Abrasives</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Learn when to choose Trizact style abrasives vs microfinishing film.

&lt;p&gt;The shop is quiet in the way only focused work can create—overhead lights humming, a small radio whispering in the corner, and the soft, steady rasp of a belt skimming steel. You’ve shaped a kitchen knife from bar stock, or maybe you’re prepping a classic car panel after welding in a patch. The hard work is done, but the finish is still miles away from what you picture: clean, even, and confident. You swap belts, try a different disc, lighten pressure, and still those stubborn lines hang on. Do you step to a more aggressive grit? Switch to a finer one? Or change the abrasive altogether?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/11.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film/cards/instagram/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film/cards/instagram/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film/cards/instagram/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film/cards/pinterest/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film/cards/pinterest/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film/cards/pinterest/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Wet Sanding Sequence 1000 To 3000 Grit</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/30/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/30/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 30 Nov 2025 13:32:41 +0000</pubDate><category>Waterproof &amp; Wet/Dry Paper</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-2500</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>clear coat</category><category>dry sanding</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Learn a pro-approved wet sanding sequence from 1000 to 3000 grit using wet dry sandpaper.

&lt;p&gt;The garage is quiet except for the steady drip from a hose into a plastic pail. You’ve taped off the washer nozzles, masked the edges, and laid out your gear like a surgeon. A foam block, a spray bottle with soapy water, microfiber towels, and a neat stack of wet dry sandpaper—1000, 2000, and 3000 grit—each sheet pre-cut and soaking. If you’ve ever stared at a hood that looked great at sunset but awful under the driveway floodlight—orange peel, dust nibs, faint sanding traces from an old repair—you know the itch to fix it properly. Today’s the day you turn that itch into an even, glassy finish with a controlled wet sanding sequence from 1000 to 3000 grit.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/09.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/30/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/30/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/30/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/30/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/instagram/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/30/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/instagram/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/30/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/instagram/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/30/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/30/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/30/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/30/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/30/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/30/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Pair Ceramics With Dust Extraction</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/29/pair-ceramics-with-dust-extraction-ceramic-sanding-discs/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/29/pair-ceramics-with-dust-extraction-ceramic-sanding-discs/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 29 Nov 2025 13:31:32 +0000</pubDate><category>Ceramic &amp; Premium Abrasives</category><category>grit-400</category><description>Engineer-tested guide to pairing ceramic sanding discs with dust extraction for cleaner air, longer disc life, and faster, cooler cuts on wood, metal, and</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="ceramic-sanding-discs-and-dust-extraction-guide"&gt;Ceramic Sanding Discs and Dust Extraction Guide&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s 7:10 p.m. in the garage, and you’re chasing the last coat-leveling pass on a maple tabletop. The light catches a swirl here, a rough patch there—and a cloud of fine dust that you don’t fully register until the sharp smell of lignin and heat hits. You stop to wipe your safety glasses, but the haze hangs on. The disc feels glazed, the sander runs hotter, and progress slows. I’ve been there dozens of times. Switching to a better abrasive helps, but the real unlock came when I paired high-performance ceramic sanding discs with a properly tuned dust extraction setup. The first night I dialed it in, the air stayed clear, the finish looked even, and my disc cut like it was fresh—for far longer than I expected.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/07.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/29/pair-ceramics-with-dust-extraction-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/pair-ceramics-with-dust-extraction-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/29/pair-ceramics-with-dust-extraction-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/pair-ceramics-with-dust-extraction-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/29/pair-ceramics-with-dust-extraction-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/pair-ceramics-with-dust-extraction-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/29/pair-ceramics-with-dust-extraction-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/pair-ceramics-with-dust-extraction-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/29/pair-ceramics-with-dust-extraction-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/pair-ceramics-with-dust-extraction-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/29/pair-ceramics-with-dust-extraction-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/pair-ceramics-with-dust-extraction-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/29/pair-ceramics-with-dust-extraction-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/pair-ceramics-with-dust-extraction-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/29/pair-ceramics-with-dust-extraction-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/pair-ceramics-with-dust-extraction-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/29/pair-ceramics-with-dust-extraction-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/pair-ceramics-with-dust-extraction-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/29/pair-ceramics-with-dust-extraction-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/pair-ceramics-with-dust-extraction-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/29/pair-ceramics-with-dust-extraction-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/pair-ceramics-with-dust-extraction-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/29/pair-ceramics-with-dust-extraction-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/pair-ceramics-with-dust-extraction-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Sponge Versus Paper On Curved Surfaces</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 15:39:58 +0000</pubDate><category>Sanding Sponges</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>grit progression</category><category>sanding block</category><category>dust control</category><description>Learn when a sanding sponge outperforms paper on curves.

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve ever stood in your garage at 9 p.m., holding a cup of coffee with one hand and a carved table leg with the other, you know the moment: the curve looks great until you touch it with the wrong abrasive. Flat spots appear, sharp lines soften, and suddenly the piece loses the crisp profile you loved. I’ve been there countless times—chair arms, bowl rims, crown molding returns—each one begging for finesse. The first time I switched from paper to a sanding sponge mid-project, it felt like I’d finally turned down the static and could hear the wood speaking again. The foam hugged the profile, didn’t dig in, and let me smooth without erasing detail.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/22.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge/cards/instagram/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge/cards/instagram/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge/cards/instagram/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge/cards/pinterest/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge/cards/pinterest/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge/cards/pinterest/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>13</readingTime></item><item><title>Best Interface Pad For Curved Surfaces</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 18:06:15 +0000</pubDate><category>Random Orbital Sanding</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>Learn how to choose the best interface pad for curved surfaces and master random orbital sanding for cleaner contours, fewer swirls, and better control.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="best-interface-pads-for-curves-in-random-orbital-sanding"&gt;Best Interface Pads for Curves in Random Orbital Sanding&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You notice it the moment you run your hand across a curved armrest you’ve just sanded: the shape is smoother, yet somehow flatter than you hoped. The ridge that gave the piece personality has softened a little too much; the transition from convex to concave feels vague. You step back, eyes scanning for the culprit, and there it is—tiny half-moons glinting in the light. Swirl marks. Anyone who’s tried to sand a contoured chair leg, a guitar body, a carved cabinet door, or even a rounded countertop edge has felt this mix of pride and frustration. You’ve done the hard work of shaping. Now the surface needs finesse without losing its curves.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/16.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding/cards/instagram/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding/cards/instagram/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding/cards/instagram/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding/cards/pinterest/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding/cards/pinterest/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding/cards/pinterest/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Light Sanding To Improve Adhesion Between Coats</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 14:39:05 +0000</pubDate><category>Between-Coats Sanding</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>dust control</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>Engineer’s guide to between coats sanding for stronger adhesion, right grits, abrasives, and timing.

&lt;p&gt;The first coat looked flawless under the shop lights. A fresh panel of maple, sealed in gloss, catching reflections like glass. Then morning sunlight cut through the window and told the truth: a constellation of dust nibs and a few faint brush marks the light had spared me the night before. If you’ve been there, you also know the impulse—grab more finish and try to bury the flaws. That almost always backfires. The next coat telegraphs the defects and, worse, may not bond optimally. That’s where the simple ritual of between coats sanding changes everything, not as a punishment, but as an engineering control.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/12.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding/cards/instagram/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding/cards/instagram/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding/cards/instagram/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding/cards/pinterest/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding/cards/pinterest/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding/cards/pinterest/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Block Sanding Techniques To Straighten Wavy Panels</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/block-sanding-techniques-to-straighten-wavy-panels-block-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/block-sanding-techniques-to-straighten-wavy-panels-block-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 22 Nov 2025 00:39:32 +0000</pubDate><category>Auto Body Sanding</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit progression</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>mirror finish</category><description>Master block sanding to straighten wavy panels.

&lt;p&gt;The first time you notice the wave is rarely under shop fluorescents. It’s usually on a quiet evening, when the sun sits low and your freshly primed quarter panel mirrors a rippling skyline instead of a straight horizon. You run a hand over the surface—smooth, no pinholes, no obvious highs—yet the reflection trembles as if it remembers every hammer blow. That’s the moment every builder meets the truth: paint doesn’t hide shape. Only block sanding, done methodically with the right abrasives, pressure, and board geometry, can translate good bodywork into panels that read as laser-straight in unforgiving light.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/02.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/block-sanding-techniques-to-straighten-wavy-panels-block-sanding/cards/facebook/block-sanding-techniques-to-straighten-wavy-panels-block-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/block-sanding-techniques-to-straighten-wavy-panels-block-sanding/cards/facebook/block-sanding-techniques-to-straighten-wavy-panels-block-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/block-sanding-techniques-to-straighten-wavy-panels-block-sanding/cards/facebook/block-sanding-techniques-to-straighten-wavy-panels-block-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/block-sanding-techniques-to-straighten-wavy-panels-block-sanding/cards/instagram/block-sanding-techniques-to-straighten-wavy-panels-block-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/block-sanding-techniques-to-straighten-wavy-panels-block-sanding/cards/instagram/block-sanding-techniques-to-straighten-wavy-panels-block-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/block-sanding-techniques-to-straighten-wavy-panels-block-sanding/cards/instagram/block-sanding-techniques-to-straighten-wavy-panels-block-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/block-sanding-techniques-to-straighten-wavy-panels-block-sanding/cards/pinterest/block-sanding-techniques-to-straighten-wavy-panels-block-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/block-sanding-techniques-to-straighten-wavy-panels-block-sanding/cards/pinterest/block-sanding-techniques-to-straighten-wavy-panels-block-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/block-sanding-techniques-to-straighten-wavy-panels-block-sanding/cards/pinterest/block-sanding-techniques-to-straighten-wavy-panels-block-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/block-sanding-techniques-to-straighten-wavy-panels-block-sanding/cards/facebook/block-sanding-techniques-to-straighten-wavy-panels-block-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/block-sanding-techniques-to-straighten-wavy-panels-block-sanding/cards/facebook/block-sanding-techniques-to-straighten-wavy-panels-block-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/block-sanding-techniques-to-straighten-wavy-panels-block-sanding/cards/facebook/block-sanding-techniques-to-straighten-wavy-panels-block-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>How To Apply Grain Filler On Open Pore Woods Like Oak</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 21 Nov 2025 13:33:23 +0000</pubDate><category>Furniture Refinishing</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>orbital sander</category><description>Learn precise grain filling for oak: abrasives, sanding workflow, filler selection, and application to achieve a glass-smooth finish on open-pore woods.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="grain-filling-oak-pro-sanding-and-filler-workflow"&gt;Grain Filling Oak: Pro Sanding and Filler Workflow&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a moment every woodworker recognizes: fingertips tracing a new oak tabletop, catching on the earlywood valleys that step across the surface like tiny terraces. Under shop lights, the finish looks glossy, almost perfect—until the raking light at sunrise reveals a topography of pores telegraphing through the film. That’s when grain filling stops being a nice-to-have and becomes a requirement. On open-pore woods like oak, ash, and mahogany, achieving a piano-flat finish asks for a deliberate sequence: correct abrasive selection, controlled scratch management, filler chemistry that matches your topcoat, and disciplined leveling. Skip any step and the pores will betray your shortcuts weeks later.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/23.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling/cards/facebook/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling/cards/facebook/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling/cards/facebook/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling/cards/instagram/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling/cards/instagram/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling/cards/instagram/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling/cards/pinterest/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling/cards/pinterest/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling/cards/pinterest/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling/cards/facebook/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling/cards/facebook/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling/cards/facebook/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Start Grit For Leveling High Spots</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/17/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/17/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 17 Nov 2025 15:18:37 +0000</pubDate><category>Plastic &amp; Epoxy Sanding</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-280</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><description>Learn the ideal start grit to level epoxy high spots, avoid clogging, and build a clean sanding workflow for flat, finish-ready surfaces.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="epoxy-sanding-best-start-grit-for-high-spots"&gt;Epoxy sanding: best start grit for high spots&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first pass tells the whole story. You stand over a curing project—maybe a kayak hull, a countertop, or a floor section—with yesterday’s resin gone glassy and a few unkind ridges catching the raking light. Your hand slides across the surface and pauses on a drip, a seam, a ripple that won’t disappear by wishful thinking. You can hear the random orbital sander on the bench before you touch it. The only decision that matters now: what grit to start with. Get it wrong and you burn time, discs, and patience. Get it right and the surface flatness comes quickly, scratches stack predictably, and the finish you planned is still in reach. I’ve spent years chasing that first cut—especially during epoxy sanding—because the first cut sets your entire workflow’s cost, heat load, and scratch management.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/28.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/17/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/17/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/17/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/17/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding/cards/instagram/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/17/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding/cards/instagram/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/17/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding/cards/instagram/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/17/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding/cards/pinterest/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/17/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding/cards/pinterest/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/17/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding/cards/pinterest/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/17/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/17/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/17/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Step Down Rules To Erase Deep Scratches</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 15 Nov 2025 16:51:30 +0000</pubDate><category>Grit Range &amp; Classification</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><description>Pro techniques for stepping down sandpaper grit to erase deep scratches on wood, metal, and plastic with precise workflows and abrasive selection.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="mastering-sandpaper-grit-for-deep-scratch-removal"&gt;Mastering sandpaper grit for deep scratch removal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first pass felt promising. Under the raking light, your tabletop—once scored by a moving box staple—looked flatter after a few steady minutes with the sander. But as you wipe the dust and the surface flashes under a shop lamp, new lines appear, marching in a tidy, parallel pattern. You didn’t make the damage worse; you simply revealed the truth. Deep scratches are not single defects; they’re profiles with depth, flanks, and torn fibers or gouged metal. Managing that geometry is why sandpaper grit selection and step-down discipline matter as much as the tool in hand.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/20.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit/cards/instagram/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit/cards/instagram/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit/cards/instagram/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit/cards/pinterest/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit/cards/pinterest/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit/cards/pinterest/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Follow Contours With Foam Interface Pads</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 15 Nov 2025 13:28:35 +0000</pubDate><category>Interface Pads &amp; Backing Pads</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>clear coat</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Engineer-tested guide to sander interface pads: foam science, thickness choices, test data, and techniques for flawless curves and edges.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="sander-interface-pad-guide-follow-contours-better"&gt;Sander interface pad guide: follow contours better&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first time I tried to refinish a vintage guitar body with tight belly cuts and arm contours, I did what most of us do: I slapped a fresh disc on my random-orbit sander and went to town. Ten minutes in, the color had evened out, but the edges told a different story—flat spots where the soft curve should have been, and a constellation of pigtails where the disc burped dust across a ridge. I stopped, frustrated. This wasn’t a flat tabletop; this was a compound curve. The tool I had was fighting the surface I wanted. That project is when a mentor handed me a simple piece of foam: a sander interface pad.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/14.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/instagram/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/instagram/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/instagram/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/pinterest/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/pinterest/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/pinterest/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Scuff Sand Between Coats With A Sponge</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 14 Nov 2025 06:26:49 +0000</pubDate><category>Sanding Sponges</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><description>Engineer-tested guide to scuff sanding between coats using a sanding sponge—grit, pressure, foam chemistry, and pro tips for flawless finishes.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="how-to-scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sanding-sponge"&gt;How to Scuff Sand Between Coats with a Sanding Sponge&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first coat looked perfect under shop lights—glossy, mirror-like, promising. Then morning sunlight cut across the panel and told the truth: a few dust nibs, a faint orange peel near the edge, and the slightest ripple where the grain lifted. I’ve been there more times than I’ll admit. The urge is to lay on more finish and hope it “levels out,” but finishing rarely rewards wishful thinking. What fixes it—quietly, consistently—is a simple pass with a sanding sponge.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/06.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge/cards/instagram/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge/cards/instagram/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge/cards/instagram/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge/cards/pinterest/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge/cards/pinterest/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge/cards/pinterest/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Choose Cork Or Rubber Blocks For Even Pressure</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 16:32:32 +0000</pubDate><category>Sanding Blocks</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>sanding block</category><description>Decide between cork and rubber sanding block for even pressure.

&lt;p&gt;You feel it before you see it: the drag of abrasive across primer, the subtle chatter in your wrist, the way dust plumes differently at the edge than it does in the center. The project might be a cabinet door with raised panels, an automotive quarter panel wearing its first coat of high-build, or a mid-century tabletop with a veneer you refuse to risk. Regardless of the substrate, the instrument in your hand—a sanding block—is the difference between flat and faceted, between crisp and crowned. When the pressure is wrong, the finish is wrong. The telltale symptoms appear later: telegraphed low spots under gloss, rounded edges where a sharp reveal should live, swirl hazing that refuses to die at the next grit.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/04.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/cards/facebook/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/cards/facebook/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/cards/facebook/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/cards/instagram/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/cards/instagram/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/cards/instagram/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/cards/facebook/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/cards/facebook/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/cards/facebook/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>13</readingTime></item><item><title>Remove Dust Nibs Between Clear Coat Layers</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 14:29:42 +0000</pubDate><category>Between-Coats Sanding</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-500</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>clear coat</category><category>dust control</category><category>wet sanding</category><description>Expert guide to between coats sanding—how to remove dust nibs, choose abrasives, and perfect clear coat finishes with pro-level workflows.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="between-coats-sanding-remove-dust-nibs-in-clear-coats"&gt;between coats sanding: remove dust nibs in clear coats&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A flawless clear coat is more than gloss; it’s the tactile confidence you feel when your hand glides across a panel with zero grit or drag. If you’ve ever stepped back from a gorgeous piece—be it a walnut tabletop, a painted cabinet door, or a guitar body—only to see and feel the specks of dust that settled into the finish, you know the sting. Those tiny dust nibs are an inevitable reality of shop air, static, and curing dynamics. Fortunately, they’re also manageable with disciplined surface prep, controlled technique, and smart abrasive choices. That’s the core of between coats sanding: deliberate, minimal-material removal focused on de-nibbing without compromising film build or clarity.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/25.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding/cards/instagram/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding/cards/instagram/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding/cards/instagram/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding/cards/pinterest/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding/cards/pinterest/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding/cards/pinterest/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Strip Failing Polyurethane Then Sand Residue Before Refinishing</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 13:37:09 +0000</pubDate><category>Paint Removal &amp; Surface Prep</category><category>paint prep</category><category>rust removal</category><category>primer coat</category><category>sanding block</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-1500</category><description>Learn expert steps for coating removal, sanding residue, and refinishing wood for durable, beautiful results with safe methods, tools, and pro tips.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="coating-removal-and-refinishing-failing-polyurethane"&gt;Coating Removal and Refinishing Failing Polyurethane&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning light spilled across the dining table you’ve hosted around for years. You set down a mug and notice the surface clings just a little; a ring remains, faint but stubborn. Along the edges, the once-smooth finish has turned brittle and chalky, tiny flakes catching the light like dust motes in motion. You run a fingertip across the spot where a placemat lives—glossy here, dull there, with a subtle ridge between. The finish is failing, and it’s happening faster than you’d like. You can feel the stakes: this is not just a table—it’s family dinners, late-night projects, first-day-of-school photos, and the clean expanse that makes a home feel ready.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/23.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal/cards/facebook/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal/cards/facebook/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal/cards/facebook/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal/cards/instagram/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal/cards/instagram/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal/cards/instagram/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal/cards/pinterest/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal/cards/pinterest/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal/cards/pinterest/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal/cards/facebook/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal/cards/facebook/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal/cards/facebook/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Scratch Pattern Control For Metal Panels Before Primer</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2025 15:09:37 +0000</pubDate><category>Metal Polishing &amp; Rust Repair</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><description>Learn expert scratch pattern control for metal panels before primer with step-by-step sanding, tool choices, and troubleshooting from a pro workshop</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="metal-surface-sanding-scratch-control-before-primer"&gt;Metal Surface Sanding: Scratch Control Before Primer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The evening a panel is finally quiet is when the real work begins. You kill the grinder, and suddenly it’s just you, a breath of solvent in the air, and sheet metal that shows everything—every ding mapped by light, every shallow wave you swore wasn’t there in the morning. I’ve been there with a door skin laid across sawhorses, work lamp low and unforgiving, palm testing the temperature of steel that still remembers the sander. This moment decides whether primer becomes a friend that hides your sins or a megaphone that announces every missed step.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/21.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding/cards/facebook/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding/cards/facebook/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding/cards/facebook/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding/cards/instagram/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding/cards/instagram/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding/cards/instagram/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding/cards/pinterest/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding/cards/pinterest/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding/cards/pinterest/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding/cards/facebook/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding/cards/facebook/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding/cards/facebook/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>How To Sand Baseboards Before Repainting Rooms</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-sand-baseboards-before-repainting-rooms-baseboard-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-sand-baseboards-before-repainting-rooms-baseboard-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2025 21:17:16 +0000</pubDate><category>Trim &amp; Molding Sanding</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>dust control</category><description>Learn expert baseboard sanding workflows for repainting: grit selection, tools, dust control, and pro prep steps for flawless trim coatings.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="baseboard-sanding-pro-workflow-for-repainting-rooms"&gt;Baseboard Sanding: Pro Workflow for Repainting Rooms&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The moment you move furniture, pull the drapes, and really look at your trim under morning light, the baseboards tell the story of the room. Years of shoes grazing the quarter round, vacuum scuffs where the wall meets the cap, and a glossy sheen that never quite cured right—these are the fingerprints of everyday life. The temptation is to tape a line and rush in with fresh paint. But in trim work, paint is only as good as the surface beneath it. Baseboard sanding is where a professional finish starts. It’s the quiet, meticulous part—deglossing hard alkyds so waterborne urethanes adhere, feathering raised chips until they disappear under primer, cutting micro-scratch patterns that promote uniform wetting. It’s dust extraction that protects your lungs and your topcoat, careful grit changes at the right moment, and an eye that knows when to repair versus when to replace.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/01.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-sand-baseboards-before-repainting-rooms-baseboard-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-baseboards-before-repainting-rooms-baseboard-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-sand-baseboards-before-repainting-rooms-baseboard-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-baseboards-before-repainting-rooms-baseboard-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-sand-baseboards-before-repainting-rooms-baseboard-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-baseboards-before-repainting-rooms-baseboard-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-sand-baseboards-before-repainting-rooms-baseboard-sanding/cards/instagram/how-to-sand-baseboards-before-repainting-rooms-baseboard-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-sand-baseboards-before-repainting-rooms-baseboard-sanding/cards/instagram/how-to-sand-baseboards-before-repainting-rooms-baseboard-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-sand-baseboards-before-repainting-rooms-baseboard-sanding/cards/instagram/how-to-sand-baseboards-before-repainting-rooms-baseboard-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-sand-baseboards-before-repainting-rooms-baseboard-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-to-sand-baseboards-before-repainting-rooms-baseboard-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-sand-baseboards-before-repainting-rooms-baseboard-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-to-sand-baseboards-before-repainting-rooms-baseboard-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-sand-baseboards-before-repainting-rooms-baseboard-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-to-sand-baseboards-before-repainting-rooms-baseboard-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-sand-baseboards-before-repainting-rooms-baseboard-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-baseboards-before-repainting-rooms-baseboard-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-sand-baseboards-before-repainting-rooms-baseboard-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-baseboards-before-repainting-rooms-baseboard-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-sand-baseboards-before-repainting-rooms-baseboard-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-baseboards-before-repainting-rooms-baseboard-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>How To Remove Polyurethane Or Varnish Safely From Furniture</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-remove-polyurethane-or-varnish-safely-from-furniture-wood-finish-removal/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-remove-polyurethane-or-varnish-safely-from-furniture-wood-finish-removal/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2025 18:54:49 +0000</pubDate><category>Furniture Refinishing</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit progression</category><category>orbital sander</category><description>Learn safe, practical wood finish removal for furniture—strip polyurethane or varnish without damage.

&lt;p&gt;It starts as a quiet, hopeful Saturday morning. You slide open a drawer on a hand-me-down dresser and the runners squeak just slightly—an honest sound, softened by decades of use. The wood is beautiful under the glare of a shiny, ambered topcoat, but the gloss is cracked in places and the color has drifted toward orange. You imagine this piece lightened, its grain breathing again, ready for a new finish that fits your home today. There’s just one thing between you and that vision: the practical reality of wood finish removal. You’ve heard horror stories about harsh chemicals, gummy messes, and hours of sanding that erase crisp edges. You’ve also heard promises about citrus strippers and miracle gels. Somewhere between the extremes sits a safe, effective path—one that respects both your health and the furniture’s history.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-remove-polyurethane-or-varnish-safely-from-furniture-wood-finish-removal/cards/facebook/how-to-remove-polyurethane-or-varnish-safely-from-furniture-wood-finish-removal.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-remove-polyurethane-or-varnish-safely-from-furniture-wood-finish-removal/cards/facebook/how-to-remove-polyurethane-or-varnish-safely-from-furniture-wood-finish-removal.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-remove-polyurethane-or-varnish-safely-from-furniture-wood-finish-removal/cards/facebook/how-to-remove-polyurethane-or-varnish-safely-from-furniture-wood-finish-removal.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-remove-polyurethane-or-varnish-safely-from-furniture-wood-finish-removal/cards/instagram/how-to-remove-polyurethane-or-varnish-safely-from-furniture-wood-finish-removal.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-remove-polyurethane-or-varnish-safely-from-furniture-wood-finish-removal/cards/instagram/how-to-remove-polyurethane-or-varnish-safely-from-furniture-wood-finish-removal.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-remove-polyurethane-or-varnish-safely-from-furniture-wood-finish-removal/cards/instagram/how-to-remove-polyurethane-or-varnish-safely-from-furniture-wood-finish-removal.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-remove-polyurethane-or-varnish-safely-from-furniture-wood-finish-removal/cards/pinterest/how-to-remove-polyurethane-or-varnish-safely-from-furniture-wood-finish-removal.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-remove-polyurethane-or-varnish-safely-from-furniture-wood-finish-removal/cards/pinterest/how-to-remove-polyurethane-or-varnish-safely-from-furniture-wood-finish-removal.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-remove-polyurethane-or-varnish-safely-from-furniture-wood-finish-removal/cards/pinterest/how-to-remove-polyurethane-or-varnish-safely-from-furniture-wood-finish-removal.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-remove-polyurethane-or-varnish-safely-from-furniture-wood-finish-removal/cards/facebook/how-to-remove-polyurethane-or-varnish-safely-from-furniture-wood-finish-removal.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-remove-polyurethane-or-varnish-safely-from-furniture-wood-finish-removal/cards/facebook/how-to-remove-polyurethane-or-varnish-safely-from-furniture-wood-finish-removal.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-remove-polyurethane-or-varnish-safely-from-furniture-wood-finish-removal/cards/facebook/how-to-remove-polyurethane-or-varnish-safely-from-furniture-wood-finish-removal.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Choose Sanding Direction To Follow The Grain</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/09/choose-sanding-direction-to-follow-the-grain-hand-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/09/choose-sanding-direction-to-follow-the-grain-hand-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 09 Nov 2025 18:57:00 +0000</pubDate><category>Hand Sanding Techniques</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-500</category><description>Learn how to choose sanding direction, optimize abrasive performance, and master hand sanding workflows for flawless, grain-aligned wood surfaces.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="hand-sanding-with-the-grain-direction-that-wins"&gt;Hand Sanding With the Grain: Direction That Wins&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first pass across the old walnut dresser felt almost sacrilegious. Early light from the shop window caught the cathedral patterns in the veneer and made the scratches I’d inherited glow silver against the warm brown. Years of hasty refinishes had left low, cross-grain swirls that refused to disappear under fresh film. I set the random-orbit sander aside, reached for a cork block, and let the board tell me where it wanted me to go. In that moment, hand sanding was not about nostalgia—it was about control. Fingers learned the flow of the fibers, eyes trained on the raking light, strokes tracking the grain like a compass needle finally finding north.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/09/choose-sanding-direction-to-follow-the-grain-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/choose-sanding-direction-to-follow-the-grain-hand-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/09/choose-sanding-direction-to-follow-the-grain-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/choose-sanding-direction-to-follow-the-grain-hand-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/09/choose-sanding-direction-to-follow-the-grain-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/choose-sanding-direction-to-follow-the-grain-hand-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/09/choose-sanding-direction-to-follow-the-grain-hand-sanding/cards/instagram/choose-sanding-direction-to-follow-the-grain-hand-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/09/choose-sanding-direction-to-follow-the-grain-hand-sanding/cards/instagram/choose-sanding-direction-to-follow-the-grain-hand-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/09/choose-sanding-direction-to-follow-the-grain-hand-sanding/cards/instagram/choose-sanding-direction-to-follow-the-grain-hand-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/09/choose-sanding-direction-to-follow-the-grain-hand-sanding/cards/pinterest/choose-sanding-direction-to-follow-the-grain-hand-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/09/choose-sanding-direction-to-follow-the-grain-hand-sanding/cards/pinterest/choose-sanding-direction-to-follow-the-grain-hand-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/09/choose-sanding-direction-to-follow-the-grain-hand-sanding/cards/pinterest/choose-sanding-direction-to-follow-the-grain-hand-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/09/choose-sanding-direction-to-follow-the-grain-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/choose-sanding-direction-to-follow-the-grain-hand-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/09/choose-sanding-direction-to-follow-the-grain-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/choose-sanding-direction-to-follow-the-grain-hand-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/09/choose-sanding-direction-to-follow-the-grain-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/choose-sanding-direction-to-follow-the-grain-hand-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Dust Reduction Strategies During Sanding</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/09/dust-reduction-strategies-during-sanding-eco-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/09/dust-reduction-strategies-during-sanding-eco-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 09 Nov 2025 13:28:15 +0000</pubDate><category>Eco &amp; Non-Toxic Abrasives</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-400</category><category>dust control</category><category>dry sanding</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Cut dust at the source with smart sanding tactics, from vacuums and eco sandpaper to room containment and cleanup.

&lt;p&gt;The first time you notice sanding dust is rarely at the tool. It’s later—when the afternoon light cuts across the room and reveals a fine, floating galaxy you didn’t know you’d made. It settles on window sills and picture frames, drifts into the next room, and somehow finds its way into the keyboard you swear you covered. If you’re working in a small shop or a spare bedroom, those particles don’t just make a mess; they linger in the air you breathe, polish themselves into a film on every surface, and complicate the finish you apply next. It’s a familiar scene to anyone who’s refinished a table, resurfaced a stair tread, or prepped cabinet doors on a weekend. The surprise is not how fast dust spreads—it’s how persistent it is once you let it escape.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/09/dust-reduction-strategies-during-sanding-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/dust-reduction-strategies-during-sanding-eco-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/09/dust-reduction-strategies-during-sanding-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/dust-reduction-strategies-during-sanding-eco-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/09/dust-reduction-strategies-during-sanding-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/dust-reduction-strategies-during-sanding-eco-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/09/dust-reduction-strategies-during-sanding-eco-sandpaper/cards/instagram/dust-reduction-strategies-during-sanding-eco-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/09/dust-reduction-strategies-during-sanding-eco-sandpaper/cards/instagram/dust-reduction-strategies-during-sanding-eco-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/09/dust-reduction-strategies-during-sanding-eco-sandpaper/cards/instagram/dust-reduction-strategies-during-sanding-eco-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/09/dust-reduction-strategies-during-sanding-eco-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/dust-reduction-strategies-during-sanding-eco-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/09/dust-reduction-strategies-during-sanding-eco-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/dust-reduction-strategies-during-sanding-eco-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/09/dust-reduction-strategies-during-sanding-eco-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/dust-reduction-strategies-during-sanding-eco-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/09/dust-reduction-strategies-during-sanding-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/dust-reduction-strategies-during-sanding-eco-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/09/dust-reduction-strategies-during-sanding-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/dust-reduction-strategies-during-sanding-eco-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/09/dust-reduction-strategies-during-sanding-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/dust-reduction-strategies-during-sanding-eco-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Consistency Of Scratch Pattern By Brand</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/consistency-of-scratch-pattern-by-brand-best-sandpaper-brand/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/consistency-of-scratch-pattern-by-brand-best-sandpaper-brand/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 08 Nov 2025 16:24:24 +0000</pubDate><category>Brand &amp; Quality Comparison</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-400</category><category>clear coat</category><category>dust control</category><description>Get uniform finishes.

&lt;p&gt;Saturday mornings in the shop have a rhythm: kettle on, dust extractor humming, the first pass of the sander checking if the week’s idea holds water. I still remember one particular maple tabletop that had me pacing. It looked flat, felt flat, yet stain kept telegraphing faint halos and random cat-scratch lines. I’d done everything “right,” but the finish wouldn’t sing. That’s when a friend dropped by and asked a deceptively simple question: “Do you trust the scratch pattern your paper leaves?” Since then, I’ve made a small obsession of it—because picking the best sandpaper brand isn’t just about how fast it cuts; it’s about how consistently it scratches, grit after grit, sheet after sheet.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/consistency-of-scratch-pattern-by-brand-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/facebook/consistency-of-scratch-pattern-by-brand-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/consistency-of-scratch-pattern-by-brand-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/facebook/consistency-of-scratch-pattern-by-brand-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/consistency-of-scratch-pattern-by-brand-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/facebook/consistency-of-scratch-pattern-by-brand-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/consistency-of-scratch-pattern-by-brand-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/instagram/consistency-of-scratch-pattern-by-brand-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/consistency-of-scratch-pattern-by-brand-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/instagram/consistency-of-scratch-pattern-by-brand-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/consistency-of-scratch-pattern-by-brand-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/instagram/consistency-of-scratch-pattern-by-brand-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/consistency-of-scratch-pattern-by-brand-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/pinterest/consistency-of-scratch-pattern-by-brand-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/consistency-of-scratch-pattern-by-brand-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/pinterest/consistency-of-scratch-pattern-by-brand-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/consistency-of-scratch-pattern-by-brand-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/pinterest/consistency-of-scratch-pattern-by-brand-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/consistency-of-scratch-pattern-by-brand-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/facebook/consistency-of-scratch-pattern-by-brand-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/consistency-of-scratch-pattern-by-brand-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/facebook/consistency-of-scratch-pattern-by-brand-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/consistency-of-scratch-pattern-by-brand-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/facebook/consistency-of-scratch-pattern-by-brand-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Film Backing For Uniform Fine Scratches</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 08 Nov 2025 13:28:53 +0000</pubDate><category>Backing Types &amp; Coatings</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>orbital sander</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>Engineer-tested guidance on film-backed, open coat sandpaper for uniform fine scratches, with data, setups, and grit sequencing tips.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="open-coat-sandpaper-on-film-for-fine-scratches"&gt;Open coat sandpaper on film for fine scratches&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The raking light told the truth I didn’t want to hear. After an hour shaping a walnut desktop, the surface looked perfect under diffuse shop lights—but the morning sun found every swirl and pigtail. I’d sanded carefully, stepped through grits, and kept the pad moving. Still, the micro-scratches telegraphed through as soon as I wiped on mineral spirits. That’s the moment I switched to film-backed abrasives and, crucially, open coat sandpaper for the early and mid-grits. The difference wasn’t subtle; it was measurable.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/instagram/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/instagram/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/instagram/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>When To Choose Ceramic Over Sic</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 08 Nov 2025 02:26:28 +0000</pubDate><category>Abrasive Materials &amp; Compounds</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><description>Learn when ceramic abrasives outperform silicon carbide sandpaper for metals, composites, and coatings, with actionable workflows and pro surface-prep tips.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="choosing-ceramic-vs-silicon-carbide-sandpaper"&gt;Choosing Ceramic vs Silicon Carbide Sandpaper&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can hear it before you see it: the sander spins up, the deck light pools across a panel, and the first passes scratch a story into the surface. On a chilly Saturday morning, I’m in a small body shop with two stacks on the cart—one ceramic-oxide disc set, one pile of silicon carbide sandpaper sheets. The job is a split personality: strip rust from a welded bracket, level high-build primer on a fender, then color-sand a fresh clear coat. The wrong abrasive wastes time and ruins finish; the right abrasive turns minutes into clean geometry and predictable gloss. And the smartest choice changes as the substrate, coating, and workflow change.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/instagram/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/instagram/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/instagram/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Grit Steps For Honing And Polishing</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/grit-steps-for-honing-and-polishing-concrete-polishing/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/grit-steps-for-honing-and-polishing-concrete-polishing/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 08 Nov 2025 01:11:57 +0000</pubDate><category>Stone &amp; Concrete Polishing</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>dust control</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Learn the exact grit sequences for honing and concrete polishing, from metal-bond cuts to high-gloss finishes, with practical tips and pro-level clarity.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="grit-steps-that-unlock-beautiful-concrete-polishing"&gt;Grit Steps That Unlock Beautiful Concrete Polishing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The café opens just before sunrise, the first light catching on cups and chrome as someone flips the sign to “Open.” Footsteps echo across the floor—once dull, scuffed, and interrupted by patchy coatings. A few weeks ago, the owner debated a full remodel. Instead, she chose a different path: refining what was already there. With a plan centered on careful grit steps, the team ground, honed, and finally achieved a reflective finish through concrete polishing. Now the floor turns light into soft ribbons. It feels new without losing its character; the aggregate tells a story, the surface is smooth, and maintenance is suddenly predictable. People pause when they walk in. They notice the room before they notice the menu.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/grit-steps-for-honing-and-polishing-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/grit-steps-for-honing-and-polishing-concrete-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/grit-steps-for-honing-and-polishing-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/grit-steps-for-honing-and-polishing-concrete-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/grit-steps-for-honing-and-polishing-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/grit-steps-for-honing-and-polishing-concrete-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/grit-steps-for-honing-and-polishing-concrete-polishing/cards/instagram/grit-steps-for-honing-and-polishing-concrete-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/grit-steps-for-honing-and-polishing-concrete-polishing/cards/instagram/grit-steps-for-honing-and-polishing-concrete-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/grit-steps-for-honing-and-polishing-concrete-polishing/cards/instagram/grit-steps-for-honing-and-polishing-concrete-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/grit-steps-for-honing-and-polishing-concrete-polishing/cards/pinterest/grit-steps-for-honing-and-polishing-concrete-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/grit-steps-for-honing-and-polishing-concrete-polishing/cards/pinterest/grit-steps-for-honing-and-polishing-concrete-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/grit-steps-for-honing-and-polishing-concrete-polishing/cards/pinterest/grit-steps-for-honing-and-polishing-concrete-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/grit-steps-for-honing-and-polishing-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/grit-steps-for-honing-and-polishing-concrete-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/grit-steps-for-honing-and-polishing-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/grit-steps-for-honing-and-polishing-concrete-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/grit-steps-for-honing-and-polishing-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/grit-steps-for-honing-and-polishing-concrete-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Soap To Water Ratio For Lubrication</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 07 Nov 2025 14:24:10 +0000</pubDate><category>Waterproof &amp; Wet/Dry Paper</category><category>grit-360</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-1200</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-2500</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>sanding block</category><description>Engineer-tested soap-to-water ratios for lubricating wet dry sandpaper on paint, wood, and metal.

&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning, a quiet garage, and a project you’ve promised yourself you’d finally finish. The headlight lenses are foggy. The table top has those telltale dust nibs in the polyurethane. A chef’s knife hangs dull on the magnetic strip, begging for bite. You fill a bucket, reach for a bottle of soap, and lay out sheets of wet dry sandpaper—ready to get to work. And then you pause. How much soap should actually go into the water? One drop? A teaspoon? More? You’ve heard “soapy water helps it glide,” but glide isn’t the only variable that matters. There’s also bite, swarf transport, scratch control, and heat. The soap-to-water ratio dictates whether you refine fast and clean—or skate on a film that kills cutting speed and blurs feedback.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/instagram/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/instagram/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/instagram/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Reduce Swirls By Pairing Pad And Grit Correctly</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/reduce-swirls-by-pairing-pad-and-grit-correctly-sander-interface-pad/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/reduce-swirls-by-pairing-pad-and-grit-correctly-sander-interface-pad/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 06 Nov 2025 13:34:29 +0000</pubDate><category>Interface Pads &amp; Backing Pads</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><description>Learn how pairing a sander interface pad with the right grits reduces swirls, improves cut control, and optimizes dust extraction for flawless finishes.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="mastering-the-sander-interface-pad-to-erase-swirls"&gt;Mastering the sander interface pad to erase swirls&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It always shows up under raking light. You sweep your flashlight across a freshly primed cabinet door or a leveled epoxy table top, and there it is—faint haloing, tight hook-shaped pigtails, and a dull gray cast that just shouldn’t be there. You did the steps. You stepped up the grits. You vacuumed between passes. But the surface still whispers “machine marks.” The moment feels familiar to anyone chasing a clean finish on wood, primer, or clear coat. The fix isn’t more pressure, more passes, or a magic abrasive. It’s control—control of contact pressure, compliance, and cut geometry. And that’s exactly what a sander interface pad delivers when paired correctly with grit and machine settings.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/reduce-swirls-by-pairing-pad-and-grit-correctly-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/reduce-swirls-by-pairing-pad-and-grit-correctly-sander-interface-pad.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/reduce-swirls-by-pairing-pad-and-grit-correctly-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/reduce-swirls-by-pairing-pad-and-grit-correctly-sander-interface-pad.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/reduce-swirls-by-pairing-pad-and-grit-correctly-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/reduce-swirls-by-pairing-pad-and-grit-correctly-sander-interface-pad.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/reduce-swirls-by-pairing-pad-and-grit-correctly-sander-interface-pad/cards/instagram/reduce-swirls-by-pairing-pad-and-grit-correctly-sander-interface-pad.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/reduce-swirls-by-pairing-pad-and-grit-correctly-sander-interface-pad/cards/instagram/reduce-swirls-by-pairing-pad-and-grit-correctly-sander-interface-pad.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/reduce-swirls-by-pairing-pad-and-grit-correctly-sander-interface-pad/cards/instagram/reduce-swirls-by-pairing-pad-and-grit-correctly-sander-interface-pad.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/reduce-swirls-by-pairing-pad-and-grit-correctly-sander-interface-pad/cards/pinterest/reduce-swirls-by-pairing-pad-and-grit-correctly-sander-interface-pad.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/reduce-swirls-by-pairing-pad-and-grit-correctly-sander-interface-pad/cards/pinterest/reduce-swirls-by-pairing-pad-and-grit-correctly-sander-interface-pad.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/reduce-swirls-by-pairing-pad-and-grit-correctly-sander-interface-pad/cards/pinterest/reduce-swirls-by-pairing-pad-and-grit-correctly-sander-interface-pad.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/reduce-swirls-by-pairing-pad-and-grit-correctly-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/reduce-swirls-by-pairing-pad-and-grit-correctly-sander-interface-pad.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/reduce-swirls-by-pairing-pad-and-grit-correctly-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/reduce-swirls-by-pairing-pad-and-grit-correctly-sander-interface-pad.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/reduce-swirls-by-pairing-pad-and-grit-correctly-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/reduce-swirls-by-pairing-pad-and-grit-correctly-sander-interface-pad.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Washable Sanding Sponges For Longer Life</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 05 Nov 2025 16:30:43 +0000</pubDate><category>Sanding Sponges</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><description>Extend abrasive life with washable sanding sponges.

&lt;p&gt;You can hear it before you feel it: that faint change in pitch as a loaded abrasive skates across the surface rather than cutting it. In a small garage shop on a drizzly Saturday, a cabinetmaker pauses mid-pass, lifting his sanding sponge to the light. The face is clogged with a pale paste—sawdust and finish residue compacted into the foam’s pores. He hasn’t even reached final grit, but the cutting action is gone and heat is creeping in. In the past, this was when he would toss the sponge and reach for a new one, the cost quietly accumulating with every project. Today, he walks to the sink, rinses the sponge under lukewarm water, massages the face with a nylon brush, and watches the slurry shed away. Thirty seconds later, the abrasive bites again, the cut is cool and even, and the workflow stays on tempo.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge/cards/instagram/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge/cards/instagram/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge/cards/instagram/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge/cards/pinterest/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge/cards/pinterest/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge/cards/pinterest/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Keep Surfaces Flat With Rigid Blocks</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 05 Nov 2025 15:23:32 +0000</pubDate><category>Sanding Blocks</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>sanding block</category><description>Learn how rigid sanding blocks keep surfaces flat, when to use them, and the techniques, materials, and tips that deliver flawless, true results.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="keep-surfaces-flat-with-a-rigid-sanding-block"&gt;Keep Surfaces Flat with a Rigid Sanding Block&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a moment in any refinishing project when your eye catches the light just right and you see it: subtle waves in a tabletop, a faint ripple in primer, a break in the reflections across a glossy guitar body. You feel it with your fingertips too—those barely-there rises and dips that make the difference between “good enough” and “crafted.” I remember the first time I noticed how my results changed when I switched from a soft pad to a rigid sanding block. The surface I thought was “close” suddenly told the truth. Within a few careful passes, the highs dulled evenly and the lows showed as untouched pencil marks. In minutes, the surface was flatter than I’d ever achieved before.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/cards/facebook/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/cards/facebook/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/cards/facebook/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/cards/instagram/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/cards/instagram/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/cards/instagram/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/cards/facebook/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/cards/facebook/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/cards/facebook/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>13</readingTime></item><item><title>Difference Between Da And Random Orbital Sanding</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 05 Nov 2025 13:35:28 +0000</pubDate><category>Random Orbital Sanding</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>dust control</category><category>clear coat</category><category>orbital sander</category><description>An engineer’s guide to the difference between DA and random orbital sanding, with test-based advice on speed, finish, abrasives, and setup.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="da-vs-random-orbital-sanding-an-engineers-guide"&gt;DA vs random orbital sanding: an engineer’s guide&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning in the shop, the kettle clicks off as the garage door rolls up and a slab of maple waits on the sawhorses. The winter light is unforgiving; it shows every swirl that last year’s “good enough” sanding left behind. In one hand: a well-balanced 5-inch palm sander; in the other: a heavier, gear-driven unit that can bulldoze epoxy ridges like a planer. The decision—random orbital sanding or the so-called DA—doesn’t feel philosophical. It’s practical. Do I want a fast, aggressive cut to level those glue lines, or a controlled, low-risk finish for the final passes? If you’ve ever chased phantom swirls under a bright lamp or watched edges burn through because you leaned a degree too far, you know the stakes.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/instagram/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/instagram/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/instagram/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/pinterest/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/pinterest/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/pinterest/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Best Grit For Sanding Between Coats Of Polyurethane</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 05 Nov 2025 04:59:16 +0000</pubDate><category>Between-Coats Sanding</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>dry sanding</category><category>clear coat</category><category>sanding block</category><description>Learn the best grit for sanding between coats of polyurethane, when to sand, and how to get a flawless, dust-free finish with pro-tested techniques.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="between-coats-sanding-best-grit-for-polyurethane"&gt;Between Coats Sanding: Best Grit for Polyurethane&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first time you run your hand across a newly finished table and feel the faint drag of tiny dust nibs, you understand why the small steps matter. Maybe it’s a maple dining top you’ve been nursing through long evenings, or a simple pine shelf that somehow carries outsized meaning. You’ve brushed on a smooth coat, waited patiently, and yet—under a raking light—tiny specks wink back at you like a constellation you didn’t intend to draw. That’s the moment when many projects turn from “good enough” to “I want this perfect.” And the bridge to perfect is almost always between coats sanding.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding/cards/instagram/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding/cards/instagram/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding/cards/instagram/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding/cards/pinterest/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding/cards/pinterest/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding/cards/pinterest/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Identify Surface Rust Versus Scale And Perforation</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/identify-surface-rust-versus-scale-and-perforation-rust-repair/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/identify-surface-rust-versus-scale-and-perforation-rust-repair/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 05 Nov 2025 04:10:19 +0000</pubDate><category>Metal Polishing &amp; Rust Repair</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>rust removal</category><description>Engineer’s guide to identify surface rust, scale, and perforation, with testing methods, abrasives, and rust repair decisions for lasting results.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="rust-repair-spotting-surface-scale-and-perforation"&gt;Rust Repair: Spotting Surface, Scale, and Perforation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning light caught the fender of my old wagon just right, the way it sometimes does when you’re not quite awake and not quite rushing. A faint blister under the paint telegraphed something I’ve learned to notice: the subtle topography of oxidation. It’s the kind of moment most of us meet with a sigh and a glance away. I paused instead. As a product engineer who’s spent years testing abrasives, primers, and coatings, I’ve learned that the difference between a quick cosmetic tune-up and a structural failure starts with how we look at rust—and how early we decide to act on it. Whether you wrench on weekends or you’re planning a professional rust repair, the first step is classification. Is it only surface rust that can be abraded clean? Is it scale that has undermined the steel layers? Or is it perforation where oxygen and time have already won a hole through the sheet?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/identify-surface-rust-versus-scale-and-perforation-rust-repair/cards/facebook/identify-surface-rust-versus-scale-and-perforation-rust-repair.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/identify-surface-rust-versus-scale-and-perforation-rust-repair/cards/facebook/identify-surface-rust-versus-scale-and-perforation-rust-repair.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/identify-surface-rust-versus-scale-and-perforation-rust-repair/cards/facebook/identify-surface-rust-versus-scale-and-perforation-rust-repair.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/identify-surface-rust-versus-scale-and-perforation-rust-repair/cards/instagram/identify-surface-rust-versus-scale-and-perforation-rust-repair.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/identify-surface-rust-versus-scale-and-perforation-rust-repair/cards/instagram/identify-surface-rust-versus-scale-and-perforation-rust-repair.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/identify-surface-rust-versus-scale-and-perforation-rust-repair/cards/instagram/identify-surface-rust-versus-scale-and-perforation-rust-repair.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/identify-surface-rust-versus-scale-and-perforation-rust-repair/cards/pinterest/identify-surface-rust-versus-scale-and-perforation-rust-repair.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/identify-surface-rust-versus-scale-and-perforation-rust-repair/cards/pinterest/identify-surface-rust-versus-scale-and-perforation-rust-repair.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/identify-surface-rust-versus-scale-and-perforation-rust-repair/cards/pinterest/identify-surface-rust-versus-scale-and-perforation-rust-repair.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/identify-surface-rust-versus-scale-and-perforation-rust-repair/cards/facebook/identify-surface-rust-versus-scale-and-perforation-rust-repair.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/identify-surface-rust-versus-scale-and-perforation-rust-repair/cards/facebook/identify-surface-rust-versus-scale-and-perforation-rust-repair.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/identify-surface-rust-versus-scale-and-perforation-rust-repair/cards/facebook/identify-surface-rust-versus-scale-and-perforation-rust-repair.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Proper Panel Degreasing Before Sanding And Painting</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/proper-panel-degreasing-before-sanding-and-painting-car-surface-prep/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/proper-panel-degreasing-before-sanding-and-painting-car-surface-prep/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 05 Nov 2025 00:02:33 +0000</pubDate><category>Auto Body Sanding</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>paint prep</category><category>dust control</category><description>Learn proper panel degreasing for car surface prep: the solvents, steps, and shop tips to avoid fisheyes and get paint to stick like it should.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="car-surface-prep-proper-panel-degreasing"&gt;Car Surface Prep: Proper Panel Degreasing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning, shop door cracked open, coffee perched on the fender, and a faint citrus-solvent smell in the air. That’s the moment I love most: quiet, focused, and full of possibility. You tape off the trim, set your DA sander on the cart, and reach for a clean set of nitrile gloves. If you’ve ever laid down a base coat only to watch it crater into fisheyes or peel at the edges, you know the pain of skipping a step in car surface prep. Most of the time the culprit isn’t your gun, your paint, or the weather—it’s contamination that never should have made it to the paint stage.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/proper-panel-degreasing-before-sanding-and-painting-car-surface-prep/cards/facebook/proper-panel-degreasing-before-sanding-and-painting-car-surface-prep.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/proper-panel-degreasing-before-sanding-and-painting-car-surface-prep/cards/facebook/proper-panel-degreasing-before-sanding-and-painting-car-surface-prep.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/proper-panel-degreasing-before-sanding-and-painting-car-surface-prep/cards/facebook/proper-panel-degreasing-before-sanding-and-painting-car-surface-prep.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/proper-panel-degreasing-before-sanding-and-painting-car-surface-prep/cards/instagram/proper-panel-degreasing-before-sanding-and-painting-car-surface-prep.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/proper-panel-degreasing-before-sanding-and-painting-car-surface-prep/cards/instagram/proper-panel-degreasing-before-sanding-and-painting-car-surface-prep.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/proper-panel-degreasing-before-sanding-and-painting-car-surface-prep/cards/instagram/proper-panel-degreasing-before-sanding-and-painting-car-surface-prep.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/proper-panel-degreasing-before-sanding-and-painting-car-surface-prep/cards/pinterest/proper-panel-degreasing-before-sanding-and-painting-car-surface-prep.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/proper-panel-degreasing-before-sanding-and-painting-car-surface-prep/cards/pinterest/proper-panel-degreasing-before-sanding-and-painting-car-surface-prep.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/proper-panel-degreasing-before-sanding-and-painting-car-surface-prep/cards/pinterest/proper-panel-degreasing-before-sanding-and-painting-car-surface-prep.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/proper-panel-degreasing-before-sanding-and-painting-car-surface-prep/cards/facebook/proper-panel-degreasing-before-sanding-and-painting-car-surface-prep.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/proper-panel-degreasing-before-sanding-and-painting-car-surface-prep/cards/facebook/proper-panel-degreasing-before-sanding-and-painting-car-surface-prep.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/proper-panel-degreasing-before-sanding-and-painting-car-surface-prep/cards/facebook/proper-panel-degreasing-before-sanding-and-painting-car-surface-prep.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>How To Sand Crown Molding Profiles Without Flattening</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 04 Nov 2025 16:44:08 +0000</pubDate><category>Trim &amp; Molding Sanding</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>sanding block</category><category>primer coat</category><category>dust control</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Learn how to sand crown molding without flattening profiles.

&lt;p&gt;On a quiet Saturday morning, you finally pull the drop cloths over your living room floor and tilt a lamp toward the ceiling. The crown molding looks elegant from a distance, but up close the paint has chipped at the corners and the once-crisp beads have gone a little blurry. You run a fingertip along a cove that should feel like a clean arc, and instead it’s a soft bump. That’s the moment when most DIYers decide to sand—and the moment many profiles lose their sharp character. The goal isn’t to erase the molding’s shape; it’s to refine the surface. With a thoughtful approach to molding sanding, you can keep each flare, bead, and cove true while preparing for a flawless new finish.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding/cards/instagram/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding/cards/instagram/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding/cards/instagram/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>How To Sand Wood By Hand For Smooth Finish</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 04 Nov 2025 03:41:00 +0000</pubDate><category>Hand Sanding Techniques</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>sanding block</category><category>grit progression</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>Learn hand sanding techniques, grit progression, and pro tips to achieve a flawless smooth wood finish with clear steps, tools, and troubleshooting.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="hand-sanding-for-a-glass-smooth-wood-finish"&gt;Hand sanding for a glass-smooth wood finish&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a quiet Saturday morning, the house is still enough to hear the tiny rasp of paper against wood. Sunlight falls across the table you’ve promised to restore—the one that’s been gathering keys, grocery bags, and happy-hour mail for years. At first glance, it seems fine. But run your fingertips from the center to the edge and you can feel a map of dents, glue drips, and faint chatter lines left by the last sander. This is where patience matters. This is where hand sanding earns its reputation.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding/cards/instagram/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding/cards/instagram/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding/cards/instagram/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Low Voc Binder Options For Abrasives</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 04 Nov 2025 03:24:31 +0000</pubDate><category>Eco &amp; Non-Toxic Abrasives</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-800</category><category>sanding block</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>clear coat</category><description>Low-VOC binder guide for eco sandpaper: materials, performance tradeoffs, and a step-by-step shop workflow for cleaner, pro-grade sanding.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="eco-sandpaper-low-voc-binder-options-that-work"&gt;Eco Sandpaper: Low-VOC Binder Options That Work&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know that smell the minute you crack open the shop on a warm morning—the stale bite of solvents baked into the air, the stuff that lingers in your nose long after the last pass with the sanding block. That’s the old world of abrasives talking. As a cabinetmaker turned workshop coach, I’ve logged hundreds of hours testing sheets, belts, and discs that either left my head buzzing or my surfaces butter-smooth. These days, the best of both worlds is real: low-VOC binders in eco sandpaper that can hold grit like a bulldog, resist loading, and let you breathe easier in a small shop without a giant extractor humming all day.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/cards/instagram/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/cards/instagram/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/cards/instagram/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Compare Disc Life And Cut Rate</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/compare-disc-life-and-cut-rate-best-sandpaper-brand/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/compare-disc-life-and-cut-rate-best-sandpaper-brand/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 04 Nov 2025 03:12:55 +0000</pubDate><category>Brand &amp; Quality Comparison</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>dust control</category><description>Engineer’s test comparing disc life and cut rate to pick the best sandpaper brand, with tips, brand picks, and methods for wood and finish sanding.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="best-sandpaper-brand-disc-life-vs-cut-rate"&gt;Best sandpaper brand: disc life vs cut rate&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still remember the first time I tried to rescue my grandmother’s maple kitchen table. The top was a scabbed map of water rings and burnished scratches, the kind of patina that tells a story but divides a family: refinish or preserve. I set the random-orbit sander on the surface, clicked on the dust extractor, and braced for the ritual dance—slow passes, overlapping lanes, listening for that pitch that says the abrasive is biting. Ten minutes in, the first disc glazed. I swapped brands, then grits. Some discs cut fast but shed grit like confetti. Others ran cool but bogged down in resin-rich end grain. At the end of that long Saturday, I wasn’t just evaluating a finish.

&lt;p&gt;A fresh sheet on a random-orbit sander tells you a lot in the first few seconds: the pitch of the motor settles, dust streams through the holes, and the panel under your palm either glides or grabs. On a soft pine shelf heavy with resin, the wrong abrasive loads so fast you can smell the heat within a minute. The scratch blends into a smeared sheen, then the pad starts skating—not cutting. You lift the sander and the disc is glazed with gummy dust cakes. The fix isn’t more pressure or another pass; it’s choosing the right coat density. That’s where open coat sandpaper, with intentional spacing between grains, changes the whole day’s trajectory.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/open-versus-closed-coat-applications-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/open-versus-closed-coat-applications-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/open-versus-closed-coat-applications-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/open-versus-closed-coat-applications-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/open-versus-closed-coat-applications-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/open-versus-closed-coat-applications-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/open-versus-closed-coat-applications-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/instagram/open-versus-closed-coat-applications-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/open-versus-closed-coat-applications-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/instagram/open-versus-closed-coat-applications-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/open-versus-closed-coat-applications-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/instagram/open-versus-closed-coat-applications-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/open-versus-closed-coat-applications-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/open-versus-closed-coat-applications-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/open-versus-closed-coat-applications-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/open-versus-closed-coat-applications-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/open-versus-closed-coat-applications-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/open-versus-closed-coat-applications-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/open-versus-closed-coat-applications-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/open-versus-closed-coat-applications-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/open-versus-closed-coat-applications-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/open-versus-closed-coat-applications-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/open-versus-closed-coat-applications-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/open-versus-closed-coat-applications-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Polish Epoxy Resin To Glass Like Finish</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 21:00:08 +0000</pubDate><category>Resin Polishing</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-1500</category><description>Learn how to polish epoxy resin to a glass-like finish with step-by-step sanding, heat control, compounds, and pro tips for durable clarity.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="resin-polishing-for-a-glass-like-epoxy-finish"&gt;Resin Polishing for a Glass-Like Epoxy Finish&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first time you run a fingertip across an epoxy surface, it’s a little magic trick. The light catches, colors bloom, and you expect the kind of clarity you see on showroom glass. But if you’ve poured, leveled, and cured resin yourself, you also know the moment that follows: under sunlight or a raking lamp, faint haze, scratch patterns, or tiny undulations whisper that the job isn’t quite done. That’s where resonant craftsmanship meets patience—where resin polishing turns a good pour into a gleaming, glass-like finish.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing/cards/instagram/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing/cards/instagram/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing/cards/instagram/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing/cards/pinterest/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing/cards/pinterest/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing/cards/pinterest/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>14</readingTime></item><item><title>Avoid Loading With Stearated Papers</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 20:47:55 +0000</pubDate><category>Plastic &amp; Epoxy Sanding</category><category>grit-280</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>dust control</category><category>grit progression</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>Master epoxy sanding without clogging.

&lt;p&gt;You know the moment: the shop is quiet, the resin river table catches morning light, and all you can see are tiny ridges, dust nibs, and a faint orange peel across that once-glassy pour. This is where projects are made—or marred. Epoxy sanding isn’t glamorous, but it’s the step that decides if your final finish looks like a mirror or a fogged window. And if you’ve ever had sandpaper load up in seconds, smear epoxy into gummy streaks, or clog your discs so fast you start doubting your gear, you’re not alone. I’ve been there—hands on the sander, vac humming, wondering why the surface keeps fighting back.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding/cards/instagram/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding/cards/instagram/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding/cards/instagram/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding/cards/pinterest/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding/cards/pinterest/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding/cards/pinterest/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>When To Use Soft Versus Firm Interface Pads</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 05:14:43 +0000</pubDate><category>Interface Pads &amp; Backing Pads</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>clear coat</category><description>Learn when to use soft vs firm sander interface pads for smoother finishes, faster leveling, and fewer defects across woodworking and auto refinishing.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="soft-vs-firm-sander-interface-pad-when-to-choose"&gt;Soft vs Firm Sander Interface Pad: When to Choose&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It starts with dust floating in the morning light and a project that matters. Maybe it’s a maple dresser you’ve promised to refinish before the baby arrives, or a fender blend on a car that’s taken you months to prep. Your sander hums to life, and the first pass feels promising—until you notice faint scratches where the grain curves, or a rounded edge where you wanted a crisp line. The tool didn’t change. The abrasive didn’t change. The difference is the cushion between them: the sander interface pad. It’s a small layer, but it decides how much pressure reaches the surface, how evenly the grit cuts, and whether the final result shows craftsmanship or compromise.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/instagram/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/instagram/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/instagram/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/pinterest/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/pinterest/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/pinterest/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>When To Use Sanding Blocks Versus Bare Hand</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 02:57:35 +0000</pubDate><category>Sanding Blocks</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>sanding block</category><category>dry sanding</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Learn when to use a sanding block versus bare-hand sanding for flawless finishes.

&lt;p&gt;The first pass of the evening always tells you how the job will go. You clamp a pine shelf to the bench, switch on the task light, and run your fingertips across a coat of primer that’s not quite right—dust nibs, a few raised grain lines, a ridge where you filled a knot. The shop is quiet except for the small rasp of paper as you tear a new sheet. You think about reaching for your trusty sanding block, the one that’s squared a hundred edges and leveled just as many fills. Then you pause. The shelf has a soft, rounded front, and you can feel a subtle dip near the corner. A hard block might flatten more than you want. Your bare hand, wrapped around a fold of 320-grit, could trace the curve and polish it without flattening the profile. This is the moment that separates a good finish from a great one: choosing the right sanding approach for the surface in front of you.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block/cards/facebook/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block/cards/facebook/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block/cards/facebook/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block/cards/instagram/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block/cards/instagram/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block/cards/instagram/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block/cards/facebook/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block/cards/facebook/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block/cards/facebook/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>13</readingTime></item><item><title>Best Grit Sheets For Detail Sanding Tools</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/best-grit-sheets-for-detail-sanding-tools-detail-sander-sheets/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/best-grit-sheets-for-detail-sanding-tools-detail-sander-sheets/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 02:40:19 +0000</pubDate><category>Detail Sander Sheets</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>paint prep</category><description>Engineer-tested guide to detail sander sheets: grit selection, backings, dust control, and brand picks for wood, paint, and plastics.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="best-grit-detail-sander-sheets-an-engineers-guide"&gt;Best Grit Detail Sander Sheets: An Engineer’s Guide&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a moment in every restoration project when the big tools step aside and the small corners decide the result. I hit that moment last winter, hunched over a mid-century nightstand with tapered legs and a drawer pull recess shaped like a teardrop. My random orbit sander took care of the top in minutes, but the tight inside curves and the sharp transitions around the pull were a different story. I swapped to a detail sander and discovered what many DIYers learn the hard way: the tool is only as precise as the sheet you mount on it. The right detail sander sheets determine whether you get crisp edges and a uniform scratch or burnished tips and clogged grit.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/best-grit-sheets-for-detail-sanding-tools-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/best-grit-sheets-for-detail-sanding-tools-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/best-grit-sheets-for-detail-sanding-tools-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/best-grit-sheets-for-detail-sanding-tools-detail-sander-sheets.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/best-grit-sheets-for-detail-sanding-tools-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/best-grit-sheets-for-detail-sanding-tools-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/best-grit-sheets-for-detail-sanding-tools-detail-sander-sheets/cards/instagram/best-grit-sheets-for-detail-sanding-tools-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/best-grit-sheets-for-detail-sanding-tools-detail-sander-sheets/cards/instagram/best-grit-sheets-for-detail-sanding-tools-detail-sander-sheets.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/best-grit-sheets-for-detail-sanding-tools-detail-sander-sheets/cards/instagram/best-grit-sheets-for-detail-sanding-tools-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/best-grit-sheets-for-detail-sanding-tools-detail-sander-sheets/cards/pinterest/best-grit-sheets-for-detail-sanding-tools-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/best-grit-sheets-for-detail-sanding-tools-detail-sander-sheets/cards/pinterest/best-grit-sheets-for-detail-sanding-tools-detail-sander-sheets.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/best-grit-sheets-for-detail-sanding-tools-detail-sander-sheets/cards/pinterest/best-grit-sheets-for-detail-sanding-tools-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/best-grit-sheets-for-detail-sanding-tools-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/best-grit-sheets-for-detail-sanding-tools-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/best-grit-sheets-for-detail-sanding-tools-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/best-grit-sheets-for-detail-sanding-tools-detail-sander-sheets.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/best-grit-sheets-for-detail-sanding-tools-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/best-grit-sheets-for-detail-sanding-tools-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>13</readingTime></item><item><title>Prevent Swirl Marks With Random Orbital Sanders</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 02:33:16 +0000</pubDate><category>Random Orbital Sanding</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-800</category><category>dust control</category><category>grit progression</category><category>dry sanding</category><category>clear coat</category><category>orbital sander</category><description>Learn expert workflows to eliminate swirl marks with random orbital sanding—covering surface prep, abrasives, dust control, and inspection.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanding"&gt;Prevent Swirl Marks with Random Orbital Sanding&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning, low sun at the window, the first coat of finish flashes across the panel you’ve been nursing all week. The figure in the oak wakes up, but so do faint halos you didn’t see under shop lights. Swirl marks. You tilt the board, squint, and realize you were moments from locking those defects under a film for good. It’s a gut-punch that most woodworkers and finish carpenters eventually feel. The culprit is rarely the tool itself; it’s the stack of process decisions that lead to one outcome or the other. The relief is that processes are controllable, and with random orbital sanding done deliberately, swirls are optional.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding/cards/instagram/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding/cards/instagram/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding/cards/instagram/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding/cards/pinterest/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding/cards/pinterest/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding/cards/pinterest/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>13</readingTime></item><item><title>Best Grit Sequence For Auto Body Sanding Before Primer</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/02/best-grit-sequence-for-auto-body-sanding-before-primer-auto-body-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/02/best-grit-sequence-for-auto-body-sanding-before-primer-auto-body-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 02 Nov 2025 23:00:27 +0000</pubDate><category>Auto Body Sanding</category><category>grit-400</category><category>wet sanding</category><description>Discover the best grit sequence for auto body sanding before primer.

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picture this: you&amp;rsquo;re standing in your garage, sunlight streaming through the windows, casting warm glows on the polished surfaces around you. Your project car, a vintage classic you&amp;rsquo;ve been restoring, gleams in the light, showing off all the hard work you&amp;rsquo;ve poured into it. But there&amp;rsquo;s one last hurdle before you can paint that final coat: the auto body sanding process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sanding is more than just a step in the restoration process; it&amp;rsquo;s an art that requires precision and patience. For both hobbyists and seasoned professionals, understanding the best grit sequence for auto body sanding before applying primer can make the difference between a flawless finish and a flawed one. It&amp;rsquo;s about achieving that perfectly smooth surface where paint adheres beautifully, ensuring a long-lasting, high-quality finish that turns heads on every drive.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/02/best-grit-sequence-for-auto-body-sanding-before-primer-auto-body-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-sequence-for-auto-body-sanding-before-primer-auto-body-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/02/best-grit-sequence-for-auto-body-sanding-before-primer-auto-body-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-sequence-for-auto-body-sanding-before-primer-auto-body-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/02/best-grit-sequence-for-auto-body-sanding-before-primer-auto-body-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-sequence-for-auto-body-sanding-before-primer-auto-body-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/02/best-grit-sequence-for-auto-body-sanding-before-primer-auto-body-sanding/cards/instagram/best-grit-sequence-for-auto-body-sanding-before-primer-auto-body-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/02/best-grit-sequence-for-auto-body-sanding-before-primer-auto-body-sanding/cards/instagram/best-grit-sequence-for-auto-body-sanding-before-primer-auto-body-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/02/best-grit-sequence-for-auto-body-sanding-before-primer-auto-body-sanding/cards/instagram/best-grit-sequence-for-auto-body-sanding-before-primer-auto-body-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/02/best-grit-sequence-for-auto-body-sanding-before-primer-auto-body-sanding/cards/pinterest/best-grit-sequence-for-auto-body-sanding-before-primer-auto-body-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/02/best-grit-sequence-for-auto-body-sanding-before-primer-auto-body-sanding/cards/pinterest/best-grit-sequence-for-auto-body-sanding-before-primer-auto-body-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/02/best-grit-sequence-for-auto-body-sanding-before-primer-auto-body-sanding/cards/pinterest/best-grit-sequence-for-auto-body-sanding-before-primer-auto-body-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/02/best-grit-sequence-for-auto-body-sanding-before-primer-auto-body-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-sequence-for-auto-body-sanding-before-primer-auto-body-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/02/best-grit-sequence-for-auto-body-sanding-before-primer-auto-body-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-sequence-for-auto-body-sanding-before-primer-auto-body-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/02/best-grit-sequence-for-auto-body-sanding-before-primer-auto-body-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-sequence-for-auto-body-sanding-before-primer-auto-body-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>6</readingTime></item></channel></rss>

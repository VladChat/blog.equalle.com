&lt;p&gt;If you’ve ever run your fingers along a glossy window casing and thought, “There’s no way paint will stick to this,” you’re right—at least not for long without the right prep. I’ve walked into plenty of homes where a beautifully painted room is betrayed by peeling, nicked baseboards and door frames. The culprit is almost always the same: slippery, factory-smooth or oil-painted trim with zero mechanical bite. This is where trim sanding earns its keep. Done right, scuff sanding turns that slick plastic-like surface into a paint-friendly foundation that your primer and topcoat can lock onto.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/26.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/23/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/23/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/23/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/23/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding/cards/instagram/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/23/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding/cards/instagram/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/23/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding/cards/instagram/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/23/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/23/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/23/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/23/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/23/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/23/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Use Hard Backing Pads For Flat Panels</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/27/use-hard-backing-pads-for-flat-panels-sander-interface-pad/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/27/use-hard-backing-pads-for-flat-panels-sander-interface-pad/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 27 Nov 2025 14:34:47 +0000</pubDate><category>Interface Pads &amp; Backing Pads</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-360</category><category>paint prep</category><description>Get pro-flat panels with hard backing pads.

&lt;p&gt;There’s a certain hush that falls over the shop when a panel finally reads flat. The lights reflect in a clean, uninterrupted glide across the grain, and you can feel the promise of that finish under your fingertips. I remember a maple tabletop that fought me for three late nights. I had a soft pad on my sander, a foam disc, and the hope that “gentle” would keep me safe. Instead, the board smiled back at me with a washboard of highs and lows. Swirls near the edges, dipped corners, and a telegraphed glue line that wouldn’t die. The fix wasn’t more time; it was the right pad. I swapped to a hard backing pad, parked a sander interface pad for the profiles and inside corners, and the surface transformed—crisp, even, and ready to finish. That day, I stopped thinking of pads as accessories and started treating them like cutting tools.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/01.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/27/use-hard-backing-pads-for-flat-panels-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/use-hard-backing-pads-for-flat-panels-sander-interface-pad.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/27/use-hard-backing-pads-for-flat-panels-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/use-hard-backing-pads-for-flat-panels-sander-interface-pad.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/27/use-hard-backing-pads-for-flat-panels-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/use-hard-backing-pads-for-flat-panels-sander-interface-pad.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/27/use-hard-backing-pads-for-flat-panels-sander-interface-pad/cards/instagram/use-hard-backing-pads-for-flat-panels-sander-interface-pad.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/27/use-hard-backing-pads-for-flat-panels-sander-interface-pad/cards/instagram/use-hard-backing-pads-for-flat-panels-sander-interface-pad.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/27/use-hard-backing-pads-for-flat-panels-sander-interface-pad/cards/instagram/use-hard-backing-pads-for-flat-panels-sander-interface-pad.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/27/use-hard-backing-pads-for-flat-panels-sander-interface-pad/cards/pinterest/use-hard-backing-pads-for-flat-panels-sander-interface-pad.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/27/use-hard-backing-pads-for-flat-panels-sander-interface-pad/cards/pinterest/use-hard-backing-pads-for-flat-panels-sander-interface-pad.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/27/use-hard-backing-pads-for-flat-panels-sander-interface-pad/cards/pinterest/use-hard-backing-pads-for-flat-panels-sander-interface-pad.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/27/use-hard-backing-pads-for-flat-panels-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/use-hard-backing-pads-for-flat-panels-sander-interface-pad.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/27/use-hard-backing-pads-for-flat-panels-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/use-hard-backing-pads-for-flat-panels-sander-interface-pad.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/27/use-hard-backing-pads-for-flat-panels-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/use-hard-backing-pads-for-flat-panels-sander-interface-pad.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Psa Discs For Aggressive Stock Removal</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/27/psa-discs-for-aggressive-stock-removal-psa-sanding-discs/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/27/psa-discs-for-aggressive-stock-removal-psa-sanding-discs/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 27 Nov 2025 13:37:06 +0000</pubDate><category>PSA Discs</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-360</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Engineer-tested guide to PSA sanding discs for rapid stock removal: materials, grit strategy, heat control, and setup tips for wood and metal.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="psa-sanding-discs-for-aggressive-stock-removal"&gt;PSA Sanding Discs for Aggressive Stock Removal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still remember the first time I leveled a twisted maple slab on a big, humming disc sander. The shop was quiet except for the steady hiss of grit meeting wood and the faint thrum of a balanced steel plate spinning up to speed. It was a late night build—coffee cooling on the bench, layout pencil lines still on the slab. I needed flat and fast, not pretty. Hook-and-loop discs had been slipping and smearing, and I was burning edges before I even got close to level. Swapping to psa sanding discs felt mundane in the moment—peel, align, stick—but the result wasn’t. The interface stopped flexing. The contact became honest. Stock disappeared, angles held, and the surface came out flat enough that a straightedge was suddenly interesting again.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/28.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/27/psa-discs-for-aggressive-stock-removal-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/psa-discs-for-aggressive-stock-removal-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/27/psa-discs-for-aggressive-stock-removal-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/psa-discs-for-aggressive-stock-removal-psa-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/27/psa-discs-for-aggressive-stock-removal-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/psa-discs-for-aggressive-stock-removal-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/27/psa-discs-for-aggressive-stock-removal-psa-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/psa-discs-for-aggressive-stock-removal-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/27/psa-discs-for-aggressive-stock-removal-psa-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/psa-discs-for-aggressive-stock-removal-psa-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/27/psa-discs-for-aggressive-stock-removal-psa-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/psa-discs-for-aggressive-stock-removal-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/27/psa-discs-for-aggressive-stock-removal-psa-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/psa-discs-for-aggressive-stock-removal-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/27/psa-discs-for-aggressive-stock-removal-psa-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/psa-discs-for-aggressive-stock-removal-psa-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/27/psa-discs-for-aggressive-stock-removal-psa-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/psa-discs-for-aggressive-stock-removal-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/27/psa-discs-for-aggressive-stock-removal-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/psa-discs-for-aggressive-stock-removal-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/27/psa-discs-for-aggressive-stock-removal-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/psa-discs-for-aggressive-stock-removal-psa-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/27/psa-discs-for-aggressive-stock-removal-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/psa-discs-for-aggressive-stock-removal-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>13</readingTime></item><item><title>Best Grits For Automotive Sanding Discs</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/26/best-grits-for-automotive-sanding-discs-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/26/best-grits-for-automotive-sanding-discs-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 26 Nov 2025 14:17:48 +0000</pubDate><category>Hook-and-Loop Discs</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-360</category><category>dust control</category><description>Learn the best grits for automotive sanding discs, with precise workflows, abrasive choices, and pro tips for faster, flatter finishes using hook and loop</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="best-grits-for-automotive-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs"&gt;Best Grits for Automotive Hook and Loop Sanding Discs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The garage is quiet except for the soft thrum of a dual-action sander spooling up, and the faint sweetness of primer in the air. Your project is a faded fender you’ve stared at for months—part nostalgia, part challenge. You’ve taped edges, set a new backup pad, and slipped on a fresh pack of hook and loop sanding discs, ready to erase rust blooms and orange peel like they were never there. It’s a simple plan: coarse to fine, feather the old paint, level the filler, bury the scratches. Yet if you’ve ever lost the plot mid-sand—loading discs in minutes, burning through edges, or chasing mysterious swirl marks—you know grit choice and workflow make or break the job.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/26.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/26/best-grits-for-automotive-sanding-discs-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/best-grits-for-automotive-sanding-discs-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/26/best-grits-for-automotive-sanding-discs-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/best-grits-for-automotive-sanding-discs-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/26/best-grits-for-automotive-sanding-discs-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/best-grits-for-automotive-sanding-discs-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/26/best-grits-for-automotive-sanding-discs-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/best-grits-for-automotive-sanding-discs-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/26/best-grits-for-automotive-sanding-discs-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/best-grits-for-automotive-sanding-discs-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/26/best-grits-for-automotive-sanding-discs-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/best-grits-for-automotive-sanding-discs-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/26/best-grits-for-automotive-sanding-discs-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/best-grits-for-automotive-sanding-discs-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/26/best-grits-for-automotive-sanding-discs-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/best-grits-for-automotive-sanding-discs-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/26/best-grits-for-automotive-sanding-discs-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/best-grits-for-automotive-sanding-discs-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/26/best-grits-for-automotive-sanding-discs-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/best-grits-for-automotive-sanding-discs-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/26/best-grits-for-automotive-sanding-discs-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/best-grits-for-automotive-sanding-discs-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/26/best-grits-for-automotive-sanding-discs-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/best-grits-for-automotive-sanding-discs-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Belt Sander Safety And Technique</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/26/belt-sander-safety-and-technique-sanding-belts/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/26/belt-sander-safety-and-technique-sanding-belts/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 26 Nov 2025 13:39:50 +0000</pubDate><category>Sanding Belts &amp; Machines</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-360</category><description>A practical guide to sanding belts, belt sander safety, smart setup, and precise techniques for clean, consistent results at the workbench.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="sanding-belts-and-belt-sander-safety-essentials"&gt;Sanding Belts and Belt Sander Safety Essentials&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a moment most makers know: you flick on the shop light before dawn, coffee warming your hands, and the room hums awake. The bench is still a little chaotic from the last session—pencils buried under shavings, the faint maple scent lingering, and a project that almost looks finished. Almost. You run your fingers over a tabletop and feel what the eye can’t see: a slight wave, a glue line sitting a hair proud, a corner that needs softening. The belt sander is there, steadfast, promising speed and control. It can erase hours of awkward hand sanding—but only if you guide it with care.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/24.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/26/belt-sander-safety-and-technique-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/belt-sander-safety-and-technique-sanding-belts.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/26/belt-sander-safety-and-technique-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/belt-sander-safety-and-technique-sanding-belts.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/26/belt-sander-safety-and-technique-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/belt-sander-safety-and-technique-sanding-belts.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/26/belt-sander-safety-and-technique-sanding-belts/cards/instagram/belt-sander-safety-and-technique-sanding-belts.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/26/belt-sander-safety-and-technique-sanding-belts/cards/instagram/belt-sander-safety-and-technique-sanding-belts.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/26/belt-sander-safety-and-technique-sanding-belts/cards/instagram/belt-sander-safety-and-technique-sanding-belts.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/26/belt-sander-safety-and-technique-sanding-belts/cards/pinterest/belt-sander-safety-and-technique-sanding-belts.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/26/belt-sander-safety-and-technique-sanding-belts/cards/pinterest/belt-sander-safety-and-technique-sanding-belts.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/26/belt-sander-safety-and-technique-sanding-belts/cards/pinterest/belt-sander-safety-and-technique-sanding-belts.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/26/belt-sander-safety-and-technique-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/belt-sander-safety-and-technique-sanding-belts.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/26/belt-sander-safety-and-technique-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/belt-sander-safety-and-technique-sanding-belts.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/26/belt-sander-safety-and-technique-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/belt-sander-safety-and-technique-sanding-belts.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Let Epoxy Cure Fully Before Sanding</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 07 Nov 2025 16:25:05 +0000</pubDate><category>Plastic &amp; Epoxy Sanding</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-360</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit progression</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>Learn why letting epoxy fully cure before sanding is essential, plus timelines, tests, grit progressions, and pro tips for flawless, clear finishes.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="epoxy-sanding-why-waiting-to-cure-pays-off"&gt;Epoxy Sanding: Why Waiting to Cure Pays Off&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a point in every resin project when anticipation and restraint collide. You’ve de‑molded a river board you poured last weekend or set down a glossy flood coat on a tabletop, and the surface is whispering promises of glass-like clarity. You picture the final reveal: the light catching the grain, the resin depth turning everyday moments into a small ceremony. You also see the last mile between what is and what could be—the smoothing, refining, and polishing phase—also known as epoxy sanding. Your hands ache to pick up the sander. But this is where patience protects your craftsmanship.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding/cards/instagram/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding/cards/instagram/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding/cards/instagram/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding/cards/pinterest/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding/cards/pinterest/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding/cards/pinterest/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Soap To Water Ratio For Lubrication</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 07 Nov 2025 14:24:10 +0000</pubDate><category>Waterproof &amp; Wet/Dry Paper</category><category>grit-360</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-1200</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-2500</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>sanding block</category><description>Engineer-tested soap-to-water ratios for lubricating wet dry sandpaper on paint, wood, and metal.

&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning, a quiet garage, and a project you’ve promised yourself you’d finally finish. The headlight lenses are foggy. The table top has those telltale dust nibs in the polyurethane. A chef’s knife hangs dull on the magnetic strip, begging for bite. You fill a bucket, reach for a bottle of soap, and lay out sheets of wet dry sandpaper—ready to get to work. And then you pause. How much soap should actually go into the water? One drop? A teaspoon? More? You’ve heard “soapy water helps it glide,” but glide isn’t the only variable that matters. There’s also bite, swarf transport, scratch control, and heat. The soap-to-water ratio dictates whether you refine fast and clean—or skate on a film that kills cutting speed and blurs feedback.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/instagram/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/instagram/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/instagram/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Longer Life Versus Standard Abrasives</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/longer-life-versus-standard-abrasives-ceramic-sanding-discs/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/longer-life-versus-standard-abrasives-ceramic-sanding-discs/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 07 Nov 2025 13:31:19 +0000</pubDate><category>Ceramic &amp; Premium Abrasives</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-360</category><category>dust control</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Compare ceramic sanding discs to standard abrasives, with actionable setup tips, workflows, and cost math to extend life and elevate surface quality.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="ceramic-sanding-discs-vs-standard-longer-life"&gt;Ceramic sanding discs vs standard: longer life&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dust collector hummed like a steady metronome as Marcus leaned into the oak tabletop, fighting a familiar battle against swirl marks and rising heat. He’d already burned through three conventional discs by mid-afternoon, each one cutting hard for a minute and then fading into a smear of loading and noise. With dinner guests arriving at seven and the table still scarred from yesterday’s router tear-out, frustration felt inevitable. His phone chimed: a colleague’s message, short and to the point—“Try ceramic sanding discs. Run lighter pressure. Keep it moving.” He shrugged, swapped the pad, and clipped on a mesh-backed ceramic disc he’d picked up on a whim.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/longer-life-versus-standard-abrasives-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/longer-life-versus-standard-abrasives-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/longer-life-versus-standard-abrasives-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/longer-life-versus-standard-abrasives-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/longer-life-versus-standard-abrasives-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/longer-life-versus-standard-abrasives-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/longer-life-versus-standard-abrasives-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/longer-life-versus-standard-abrasives-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/longer-life-versus-standard-abrasives-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/longer-life-versus-standard-abrasives-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/longer-life-versus-standard-abrasives-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/longer-life-versus-standard-abrasives-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/longer-life-versus-standard-abrasives-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/longer-life-versus-standard-abrasives-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/longer-life-versus-standard-abrasives-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/longer-life-versus-standard-abrasives-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/longer-life-versus-standard-abrasives-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/longer-life-versus-standard-abrasives-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/longer-life-versus-standard-abrasives-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/longer-life-versus-standard-abrasives-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/longer-life-versus-standard-abrasives-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/longer-life-versus-standard-abrasives-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/longer-life-versus-standard-abrasives-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/longer-life-versus-standard-abrasives-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item></channel></rss>

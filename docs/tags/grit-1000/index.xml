&lt;p&gt;The first time you chase a flawless finish across a curving fender, a hand-turned wooden bowl, or the bell of an aluminum bike frame, you learn quickly that flat-surface habits don’t translate. On a crown or complex radius, the surface fights back—edges burn through, pressure spikes leave troughs, and scratches creep in from directions you didn’t intend. The instinct is to push harder or switch to a coarser abrasive; the better move is to refine the contact mechanics. This is where a soft interface pad and properly chosen wet dry sandpaper change the game. Together, they transform an unpredictable contour into a controllable contact patch, preserving geometry while delivering consistent cut and uniform scratch.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/12.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/04/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/04/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/04/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/04/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/instagram/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/04/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/instagram/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/04/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/instagram/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/04/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/04/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/04/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/04/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/04/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/04/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Film Backed Ceramics For Uniform Scratch</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jan 2026 15:06:46 +0000</pubDate><category>Ceramic &amp; Premium Abrasives</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-280</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>dust control</category><category>clear coat</category><description>Learn how film-backed ceramic sanding discs deliver a uniform scratch pattern with better cut and control.

&lt;p&gt;You notice it first in the light. That telltale halo that appears when you shift the panel under a shop lamp, the swirl that refuses to quit even after another pass with the sander. Maybe it’s a cabinet door you’ve been nursing back to life, a car fender in primer that has to be perfect for color, or a guitar body on its third clear coat. You’re not chasing shine yet—you’re chasing uniformity. A clean, even scratch pattern is the quiet foundation of every flawless finish, and when it isn’t there, everything downstream becomes harder: filler prints through, paint mottles, topcoats telegraph the tiniest inconsistencies. The solution often starts earlier than we think—at the abrasive itself.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/10.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Avoid Cutting Through Color Coats When Sanding Between</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/29/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/29/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 13:42:54 +0000</pubDate><category>Between-Coats Sanding</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>clear coat</category><category>grit progression</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>Avoid sand-through on stained or painted projects.

&lt;p&gt;The first time I cut through a beautifully shaded guitar body, it was 11:30 p.m. in a quiet shop. The color was perfect—warm amber base, a gentle burst on the edges, and just enough depth to make the figure dance. I’d laid down two clear coats, feeling confident, and went in for a “quick scuff” before the third. Ten strokes in, the block slipped off a radius and I saw it: a pale witness line peeking through the color, a little halo of heartbreak. If you’ve ever felt that knot in your gut, you know that between coats sanding can make or break a project.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/13.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/29/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/29/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/29/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/29/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding/cards/instagram/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/29/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding/cards/instagram/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/29/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding/cards/instagram/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/29/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding/cards/pinterest/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/29/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding/cards/pinterest/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/29/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding/cards/pinterest/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/29/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/29/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/29/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Soak Time For Wet Sanding Paper Or Discs Before Use</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/26/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-paper-or-discs-before-use-wet-sanding-clear-coat/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/26/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-paper-or-discs-before-use-wet-sanding-clear-coat/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 13:38:12 +0000</pubDate><category>Wet Sanding Clear Coat</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>clear coat</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Master soak time for wet sanding paper and discs before use.

&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning in the shop, coffee steaming on the bench, the hood you painted last weekend stares back with a stubborn peel and a couple of dust nibs. There’s a bucket by your boots and a fistful of dark gray sheets curling at the corners. You know the next hour will make or break the finish—this is the moment where patience and process turn wavy reflections into a razor-straight mirror. When you’re wet sanding clear coat, the way you prepare your abrasives—specifically how long you soak them—can be the difference between an easy, controlled cut and a chewed-up mess that forces a respray. I’ve watched pros ruin perfect paint because they rushed the soak. I’ve also seen hobbyists hit glass-smooth results their first time by dialing in this one simple variable.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/05.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/26/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-paper-or-discs-before-use-wet-sanding-clear-coat/cards/facebook/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-paper-or-discs-before-use-wet-sanding-clear-coat.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/26/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-paper-or-discs-before-use-wet-sanding-clear-coat/cards/facebook/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-paper-or-discs-before-use-wet-sanding-clear-coat.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/26/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-paper-or-discs-before-use-wet-sanding-clear-coat/cards/facebook/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-paper-or-discs-before-use-wet-sanding-clear-coat.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/26/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-paper-or-discs-before-use-wet-sanding-clear-coat/cards/instagram/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-paper-or-discs-before-use-wet-sanding-clear-coat.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/26/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-paper-or-discs-before-use-wet-sanding-clear-coat/cards/instagram/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-paper-or-discs-before-use-wet-sanding-clear-coat.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/26/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-paper-or-discs-before-use-wet-sanding-clear-coat/cards/instagram/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-paper-or-discs-before-use-wet-sanding-clear-coat.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/26/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-paper-or-discs-before-use-wet-sanding-clear-coat/cards/pinterest/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-paper-or-discs-before-use-wet-sanding-clear-coat.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/26/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-paper-or-discs-before-use-wet-sanding-clear-coat/cards/pinterest/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-paper-or-discs-before-use-wet-sanding-clear-coat.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/26/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-paper-or-discs-before-use-wet-sanding-clear-coat/cards/pinterest/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-paper-or-discs-before-use-wet-sanding-clear-coat.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/26/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-paper-or-discs-before-use-wet-sanding-clear-coat/cards/facebook/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-paper-or-discs-before-use-wet-sanding-clear-coat.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/26/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-paper-or-discs-before-use-wet-sanding-clear-coat/cards/facebook/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-paper-or-discs-before-use-wet-sanding-clear-coat.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/26/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-paper-or-discs-before-use-wet-sanding-clear-coat/cards/facebook/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-paper-or-discs-before-use-wet-sanding-clear-coat.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Clean Pads To Prevent Micro Marring</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 17 Dec 2025 16:21:55 +0000</pubDate><category>Resin Polishing</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>clear coat</category><category>polishing pads</category><description>Stop swirls and haze.

&lt;p&gt;I’ve watched the same scene a hundred times: you finish a long day of shaping, sanding, and dialing in the gloss. The shop is quiet, the floor swept, your coffee cold. You swing the work light across the panel—maybe it’s a black hood, a river table, or a batch of resin bangles—and your stomach sinks. There it is: a faint gray haze of tiny trails that weren’t visible under the shop lights. That’s micro marring, and nine times out of ten it’s not your machine, polish, or even your technique—it’s what’s happening at the pad face. This is where cleaning while you work becomes the difference between “almost” and “absolutely flawless,” whether you’re finishing paint or doing resin polishing on jewelry and tabletops.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/02.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing/cards/instagram/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing/cards/instagram/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing/cards/instagram/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing/cards/pinterest/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing/cards/pinterest/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing/cards/pinterest/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Keep Heat Low To Prevent Softening</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 17 Dec 2025 14:27:08 +0000</pubDate><category>Plastic &amp; Epoxy Sanding</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>wet sanding</category><description>Engineer-tested guide to epoxy sanding without softening.

&lt;p&gt;The room is quiet except for the soft whirr of a 5-inch random orbital sander. You’ve invested hours pouring a resin river through a slab of maple, watched the swirl of pigment lock under crystal clarity, and now you’re finally leveling the surface for that glass-smooth finish. Then it happens—under the pad, the epoxy feels different. The sander drags, the dust turns to smeary ribbons, and the finish dulls into a gummy haze. If you’ve experienced that sinking feeling, you’ve already met the enemy of precision finishing: heat buildup.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/29.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding/cards/instagram/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding/cards/instagram/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding/cards/instagram/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding/cards/pinterest/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding/cards/pinterest/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding/cards/pinterest/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Finish Out Micro Marring And Haze</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 10 Dec 2025 13:42:22 +0000</pubDate><category>Polishing &amp; Finishing</category><category>mirror finish</category><category>polishing pads</category><category>grit progression</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>clear coat</category><description>Learn how to finish out micro marring and haze using polishing sandpaper, pads, and polish.

&lt;p&gt;It’s 9 p.m., the shop lights are humming, and the panel you’ve been nursing all day looks perfect—until you hit it with a tight, cool LED beam. There it is: a faint cloudy halo that follows the light like a shadow. Micro marring. Haze. It doesn’t ruin a job, but it steals the depth that makes a finish sing. I’ve seen it a thousand times—after wet sanding runs, after cutting with a heavy compound, even after a rushed “final” pass. The good news is you can bring the gloss back. You just need the right sequence, the right pressure, and (yes) the right polishing sandpaper so every step sets up the next.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/28.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper/cards/instagram/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper/cards/instagram/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper/cards/instagram/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Grind Out Rust And Feather Edges For Patch Repair</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 14:44:40 +0000</pubDate><category>Metal Polishing &amp; Rust Repair</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>rust removal</category><description>Learn rust repair the right way: grind out corrosion, feather paint edges, and patch cleanly for durable, near-invisible automotive fixes.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="rust-repair-101-grind-feather-and-patch-like-pro"&gt;Rust Repair 101: Grind, Feather, and Patch Like Pro&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The moment you notice it is rarely dramatic. Maybe you’re pouring your first cup of coffee, the driveway still cool in the morning shade, when a small bubble on the wheel arch catches your eye. It wasn’t there last summer. You press lightly; the paint flexes and flattens like a blister. It’s a tiny flaw, easy to ignore while the engine warms and the day rushes in. But you know how rust works. It doesn’t wait. It keeps chewing, one quiet day after another, under glossy paint where you can’t see it.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/22.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair/cards/facebook/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair/cards/facebook/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair/cards/facebook/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair/cards/instagram/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair/cards/instagram/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair/cards/instagram/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair/cards/pinterest/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair/cards/pinterest/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair/cards/pinterest/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair/cards/facebook/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair/cards/facebook/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair/cards/facebook/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Open Coat Versus Closed Coat Impacts</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 13:41:49 +0000</pubDate><category>Abrasive Materials &amp; Compounds</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-1200</category><description>Open vs closed coat sanding explained with lab-tested data.

&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning in the shop is supposed to be simple: one mug of coffee, a walnut desktop to final-sand, and a couple of hours of quiet before the house wakes up. Instead, at pass number fifteen, the paper glazes over. The dust lines smear into the grain, and the sander’s pitch changes—a small but telling protest. I switch sheets, still chasing that consistent, haze-free scratch pattern. When I move to wet-sand a lacquer test panel, silicon carbide sandpaper comes out of the drawer—its black grit and smooth backing a distinct contrast to the tan aluminum oxide I’ve used on the walnut. Ten minutes later, I’m flattening a glued-up end-grain cutting board, then stepping over to clean up a steel plane body. Same sander, same operator, but suddenly my results diverge depending on one detail I often overlook: how densely the abrasive grains were packed onto the paper in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/23.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/instagram/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/instagram/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/instagram/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Refine To 2000–3000 For Quick Polish</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 01 Dec 2025 15:17:23 +0000</pubDate><category>Plastic &amp; Epoxy Sanding</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>Master epoxy sanding from 800 to 2000–3000 grit for a fast, haze-free polish with pro-level technique, abrasives, and workflow control.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="epoxy-sanding-quick-polish-at-20003000-grit"&gt;Epoxy Sanding: Quick Polish at 2000–3000 Grit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You set the project down with both hands, the way you place a full coffee mug on a brand-new table—carefully, like it could bruise. Yesterday it was a cloudy slab: dust nibs, tiny ripples, a faint orange peel. Today, it’s close. Under the shop LEDs, you can already see straight lines in the reflection, but not a perfect mirror—still a little fog, still a couple of shallow witness lines that your eyes keep returning to. The moment is tempting: grab a compound and try to bully the gloss into existence. But you’ve done this long enough to know that shine doesn’t come from polish alone; it’s earned in the scratch pattern. This is where epoxy sanding decides whether you’ll be buffing for minutes or for hours, whether the finish will hold up in sunlight or betray you with haloed swirls.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/13.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding/cards/instagram/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding/cards/instagram/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding/cards/instagram/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding/cards/pinterest/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding/cards/pinterest/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding/cards/pinterest/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Wet Sanding Sequence 1000 To 3000 Grit</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/30/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/30/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 30 Nov 2025 13:32:41 +0000</pubDate><category>Waterproof &amp; Wet/Dry Paper</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-2500</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>clear coat</category><category>dry sanding</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Learn a pro-approved wet sanding sequence from 1000 to 3000 grit using wet dry sandpaper.

&lt;p&gt;The garage is quiet except for the steady drip from a hose into a plastic pail. You’ve taped off the washer nozzles, masked the edges, and laid out your gear like a surgeon. A foam block, a spray bottle with soapy water, microfiber towels, and a neat stack of wet dry sandpaper—1000, 2000, and 3000 grit—each sheet pre-cut and soaking. If you’ve ever stared at a hood that looked great at sunset but awful under the driveway floodlight—orange peel, dust nibs, faint sanding traces from an old repair—you know the itch to fix it properly. Today’s the day you turn that itch into an even, glassy finish with a controlled wet sanding sequence from 1000 to 3000 grit.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/09.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/30/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/30/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/30/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/30/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/instagram/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/30/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/instagram/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/30/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/instagram/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/30/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/30/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/30/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/30/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/30/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/30/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Why Uv Protective Clear Coat Is Required After Restoration</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 23 Nov 2025 13:28:43 +0000</pubDate><category>Headlight Restoration</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>clear coat</category><category>wet sanding</category><description>Discover why a UV clear coat is vital after restoration.

&lt;p&gt;You know that moment when the shop door rolls up, the morning light hits your freshly restored project, and you catch the reflection—crisp, glassy, and clean? Whether it’s a set of previously cloudy headlights, an oxidized hood you’ve cut and polished, or a faded motorcycle fairing you’ve brought back to life, it feels like breathing new air. I’ve been there on a Saturday morning, rag in one hand, inspection light in the other, admiring that deep clarity. It’s the quiet pride of a job well done. But here’s the tough-love truth: without a UV clear coat to seal that clarity, the sun will start undoing your work the second you roll outside.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/06.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat/cards/facebook/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat/cards/facebook/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat/cards/facebook/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat/cards/instagram/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat/cards/instagram/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat/cards/instagram/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat/cards/pinterest/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat/cards/pinterest/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat/cards/pinterest/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat/cards/facebook/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat/cards/facebook/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat/cards/facebook/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>How To Apply Grain Filler On Open Pore Woods Like Oak</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 21 Nov 2025 13:33:23 +0000</pubDate><category>Furniture Refinishing</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>orbital sander</category><description>Learn precise grain filling for oak: abrasives, sanding workflow, filler selection, and application to achieve a glass-smooth finish on open-pore woods.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="grain-filling-oak-pro-sanding-and-filler-workflow"&gt;Grain Filling Oak: Pro Sanding and Filler Workflow&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a moment every woodworker recognizes: fingertips tracing a new oak tabletop, catching on the earlywood valleys that step across the surface like tiny terraces. Under shop lights, the finish looks glossy, almost perfect—until the raking light at sunrise reveals a topography of pores telegraphing through the film. That’s when grain filling stops being a nice-to-have and becomes a requirement. On open-pore woods like oak, ash, and mahogany, achieving a piano-flat finish asks for a deliberate sequence: correct abrasive selection, controlled scratch management, filler chemistry that matches your topcoat, and disciplined leveling. Skip any step and the pores will betray your shortcuts weeks later.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/23.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling/cards/facebook/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling/cards/facebook/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling/cards/facebook/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling/cards/instagram/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling/cards/instagram/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling/cards/instagram/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling/cards/pinterest/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling/cards/pinterest/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling/cards/pinterest/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling/cards/facebook/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling/cards/facebook/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling/cards/facebook/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Cut Rate And Loading Behavior By Grain</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2025 00:57:05 +0000</pubDate><category>Abrasive Materials &amp; Compounds</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>clear coat</category><category>orbital sander</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>Engineer’s guide to silicon carbide sandpaper—cut rate, loading, grain physics, and practical tips to choose the right abrasive for paint, metal, and</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="silicon-carbide-sandpaper-cut-rate-and-loading"&gt;Silicon Carbide Sandpaper: Cut Rate and Loading&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning in the garage, the air smelled faintly of cut clear coat and soapy water. A half-finished motorcycle tank sat on a foam cradle, its orange peel and dust nibs highlighted by a raking LED panel. I’d already tried a few sheets of 1500 grit from a contractor pack, but they stalled after a few passes, loading with milky slurry and leaving stray scratches that would require more polish later. This is the moment that separates a casual sand from a dependable workflow—the point where abrasive choice dictates not just speed, but consistency and finish quality. Swapping to silicon carbide sandpaper felt like a small change, but it reset the process: faster leveling, more controllable scratch patterns, and fewer surprise defects.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/09.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/instagram/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/instagram/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/instagram/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Densifier Timing For Stronger Surface</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/densifier-timing-for-stronger-surface-concrete-polishing/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/densifier-timing-for-stronger-surface-concrete-polishing/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2025 15:46:00 +0000</pubDate><category>Stone &amp; Concrete Polishing</category><category>grit-40</category><category>grit-50</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-1000</category><description>Master densifier timing in concrete polishing to unlock higher hardness, gloss, and abrasion resistance with reliable, step-by-step workflow guidance.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="densifier-timing-for-stronger-concrete-polishing"&gt;Densifier Timing for Stronger Concrete Polishing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first time you walk across a newly polished shop floor, the sound underfoot tells you nearly everything: tight, crystalline, with no chalky whisper at your heel. A good concrete polish isn’t only about sheen; it’s the tactile confirmation that the surface has been chemically tightened and mechanically refined in harmony. Yet that harmony is fragile. If you’ve ever watched slurry smear instead of cutting, or seen a gloss peak early and then plateau—no matter how many passes—you’ve felt how unforgiving poor timing can be. The densifier you choose, and more importantly when you put it down, can either lock in a fine scratch pattern and raise surface hardness or entomb flaws and waste abrasive life.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/07.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/densifier-timing-for-stronger-surface-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/densifier-timing-for-stronger-surface-concrete-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/densifier-timing-for-stronger-surface-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/densifier-timing-for-stronger-surface-concrete-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/densifier-timing-for-stronger-surface-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/densifier-timing-for-stronger-surface-concrete-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/densifier-timing-for-stronger-surface-concrete-polishing/cards/instagram/densifier-timing-for-stronger-surface-concrete-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/densifier-timing-for-stronger-surface-concrete-polishing/cards/instagram/densifier-timing-for-stronger-surface-concrete-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/densifier-timing-for-stronger-surface-concrete-polishing/cards/instagram/densifier-timing-for-stronger-surface-concrete-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/densifier-timing-for-stronger-surface-concrete-polishing/cards/pinterest/densifier-timing-for-stronger-surface-concrete-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/densifier-timing-for-stronger-surface-concrete-polishing/cards/pinterest/densifier-timing-for-stronger-surface-concrete-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/densifier-timing-for-stronger-surface-concrete-polishing/cards/pinterest/densifier-timing-for-stronger-surface-concrete-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/densifier-timing-for-stronger-surface-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/densifier-timing-for-stronger-surface-concrete-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/densifier-timing-for-stronger-surface-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/densifier-timing-for-stronger-surface-concrete-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/densifier-timing-for-stronger-surface-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/densifier-timing-for-stronger-surface-concrete-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Choose Pad And Compound For Plastics</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 13:37:22 +0000</pubDate><category>Resin Polishing</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>grit progression</category><category>sanding block</category><category>polishing pads</category><description>Engineer’s guide to resin polishing: pick the right pad and compound for acrylic, polycarbonate, and epoxy.

&lt;p&gt;On a quiet Saturday, I watched a friend slowly lower a buffing pad onto the cloudy edge of his epoxy river table. The coffee mugs had left fine scuffs; sunlight turned them into halos. He’d already tried an all-purpose metal polish and a “universal” wool pad—both grabbed hard, smeared the surface, and left the epoxy warmer than I liked. He looked at me and asked the question I hear weekly: “Which pad and which compound do I actually use for plastics?” It’s an honest question with costly consequences if you guess wrong. Unlike metal paint systems that tolerate a surprising amount of heat and pressure, plastics and cured resins can haze, smear, or stress-craze from a few seconds of the wrong contact.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/01.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/cards/instagram/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/cards/instagram/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/cards/instagram/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/cards/pinterest/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/cards/pinterest/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/cards/pinterest/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>13</readingTime></item><item><title>Use Graded Micron Steps For Polishing</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/17/use-graded-micron-steps-for-polishing-microfinishing-film/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/17/use-graded-micron-steps-for-polishing-microfinishing-film/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 17 Nov 2025 13:37:17 +0000</pubDate><category>Specialty Abrasives</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>mirror finish</category><description>Learn how to use graded micron steps with microfinishing film to achieve flawless, repeatable polishing on knives, tools, jewelry, and precision parts.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="master-micron-steps-with-microfinishing-film"&gt;Master Micron Steps with microfinishing film&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’ve ever tried to slice a ripe tomato with a “sharp” knife that snagged and crushed instead of gliding cleanly, you’ve felt the cost of a rough edge. Maybe it was during a weekend project: you chamfered a piece of walnut for a picture frame, then paused, disappointed by the faint haze that dulled the grain’s depth. Or you inspected a watch case under a bright lamp and saw fine tracks that only appear when the light hits just right—marks that steal the mirror finish you were hoping for. In those moments, perfection seems close but just out of reach.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/26.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/17/use-graded-micron-steps-for-polishing-microfinishing-film/cards/facebook/use-graded-micron-steps-for-polishing-microfinishing-film.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/17/use-graded-micron-steps-for-polishing-microfinishing-film/cards/facebook/use-graded-micron-steps-for-polishing-microfinishing-film.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/17/use-graded-micron-steps-for-polishing-microfinishing-film/cards/facebook/use-graded-micron-steps-for-polishing-microfinishing-film.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/17/use-graded-micron-steps-for-polishing-microfinishing-film/cards/instagram/use-graded-micron-steps-for-polishing-microfinishing-film.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/17/use-graded-micron-steps-for-polishing-microfinishing-film/cards/instagram/use-graded-micron-steps-for-polishing-microfinishing-film.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/17/use-graded-micron-steps-for-polishing-microfinishing-film/cards/instagram/use-graded-micron-steps-for-polishing-microfinishing-film.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/17/use-graded-micron-steps-for-polishing-microfinishing-film/cards/pinterest/use-graded-micron-steps-for-polishing-microfinishing-film.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/17/use-graded-micron-steps-for-polishing-microfinishing-film/cards/pinterest/use-graded-micron-steps-for-polishing-microfinishing-film.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/17/use-graded-micron-steps-for-polishing-microfinishing-film/cards/pinterest/use-graded-micron-steps-for-polishing-microfinishing-film.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/17/use-graded-micron-steps-for-polishing-microfinishing-film/cards/facebook/use-graded-micron-steps-for-polishing-microfinishing-film.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/17/use-graded-micron-steps-for-polishing-microfinishing-film/cards/facebook/use-graded-micron-steps-for-polishing-microfinishing-film.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/17/use-graded-micron-steps-for-polishing-microfinishing-film/cards/facebook/use-graded-micron-steps-for-polishing-microfinishing-film.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Remove Dust Nibs Between Clear Coat Layers</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 14:29:42 +0000</pubDate><category>Between-Coats Sanding</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-500</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>clear coat</category><category>dust control</category><category>wet sanding</category><description>Expert guide to between coats sanding—how to remove dust nibs, choose abrasives, and perfect clear coat finishes with pro-level workflows.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="between-coats-sanding-remove-dust-nibs-in-clear-coats"&gt;between coats sanding: remove dust nibs in clear coats&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A flawless clear coat is more than gloss; it’s the tactile confidence you feel when your hand glides across a panel with zero grit or drag. If you’ve ever stepped back from a gorgeous piece—be it a walnut tabletop, a painted cabinet door, or a guitar body—only to see and feel the specks of dust that settled into the finish, you know the sting. Those tiny dust nibs are an inevitable reality of shop air, static, and curing dynamics. Fortunately, they’re also manageable with disciplined surface prep, controlled technique, and smart abrasive choices. That’s the core of between coats sanding: deliberate, minimal-material removal focused on de-nibbing without compromising film build or clarity.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/25.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding/cards/instagram/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding/cards/instagram/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding/cards/instagram/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding/cards/pinterest/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding/cards/pinterest/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding/cards/pinterest/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Compound Versus Polish Differences For Clear Coat Finishing</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2025 05:56:37 +0000</pubDate><category>Wet Sanding Clear Coat</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-2500</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>clear coat</category><category>wet sanding</category><description>Understand compound vs polish for clear coat finishing with sanding workflows, abrasive selection, and process control for defect-free paint polishing.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="paint-polishing-compound-vs-polish-for-clear-coat"&gt;Paint polishing: compound vs polish for clear coat&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Saturday morning sun can be the most unforgiving inspector you’ll ever meet. You back the car out after a late-night respray—coffee in hand, optimism high—and the light slices across the hood like a straightedge. Orange peel you knew about, sure. But then the swirls appear, whisper-fine arcs barely visible at dusk now glaring at full volume. You feel them before you see them: the drag of a microfiber catching on texture, the way your eyes follow a ghosty hologram around a curved fender. This is the moment when “wash and wax” ends and craft begins—where surface preparation, abrasive control, and paint polishing decide whether you get a mirror or a mirage.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/17.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing/cards/facebook/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing/cards/facebook/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing/cards/facebook/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing/cards/instagram/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing/cards/instagram/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing/cards/instagram/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing/cards/pinterest/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing/cards/pinterest/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing/cards/pinterest/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing/cards/facebook/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing/cards/facebook/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing/cards/facebook/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Wet Sanding To Control Marine Dust</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 08 Nov 2025 00:54:10 +0000</pubDate><category>Marine Sanding</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>orbital sander</category><category>dry sanding</category><category>sanding block</category><category>mirror finish</category><description>Learn wet boat sanding to cut toxic dust, protect waterways, and prep your hull right.

&lt;p&gt;There’s a particular quiet to the yard before sunrise. The halyards ping, the coffee steams in a chipped thermos, and the hull you’ve been avoiding stands there like a promise you can’t put off. I’ve been on both sides of that moment—rushing, dusty, and regretting shortcuts later—and the method that changed the game for me was wet boat sanding. Not because it’s pretty, but because it’s efficient, safer for your lungs, and easier to keep the neighbors and the yard manager happy. You control the mess. You protect the water you love. And you end the day with a hull that’s flatter, cooler, and ready to bond.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding/cards/instagram/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding/cards/instagram/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding/cards/instagram/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding/cards/pinterest/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding/cards/pinterest/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding/cards/pinterest/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Progressive Micron Steps For Clarity</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 08 Nov 2025 00:41:16 +0000</pubDate><category>Glass &amp; Ceramics Sanding</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-500</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>Engineer-tested guide to glass sanding using progressive micron steps for optical clarity, with media choices, wet technique, and polishing workflow.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="glass-sanding-progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity"&gt;Glass Sanding: Progressive Micron Steps for Clarity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You notice it first at breakfast—the way the morning light breaks into a haze across your coffee table. A scratch the length of a paperclip sits dead center, scattering highlights into a milky halo that wasn’t there last week. You run a fingernail across it. The catch is slight, but it’s there. It’s the same story with a watch crystal that met a brick wall one hurried afternoon, or a window panel that’s accumulated fine swirls from years of cleaning. Replacing glass is one option, but it’s expensive, wasteful, and impractical for built-ins. As a product engineer who spends an unreasonable amount of time testing abrasives, I prefer another route: controlled, progressive glass sanding that restores optical clarity rather than hides damage.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding/cards/instagram/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding/cards/instagram/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding/cards/instagram/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding/cards/pinterest/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding/cards/pinterest/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding/cards/pinterest/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Remove 1500–2000 Grit Marks On Resin</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 07 Nov 2025 23:56:25 +0000</pubDate><category>Resin Polishing</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-1200</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-2500</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>dust control</category><description>Expert workflows to remove 1500–2000 grit marks on resin and achieve optical clarity with the right abrasives, compounds, and heat control.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="resin-polishing-erasing-15002000-grit-scratches"&gt;Resin Polishing: Erasing 1500–2000 Grit Scratches&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pendant looked flawless on the bench last night—glassy, color suspended in amber, edges softened just so. Then morning light hit it. Under a low-angle window beam, micro-scratches flared across the surface like frost on a windshield. You could feel your shoulders sag. You did the careful wet-sand through 1500 and 2000, kept the strokes even, swirled the slurry away. It should be done. But resin is unforgiving under raking light, and 1500–2000 grit marks hang on, whisper-thin but brutally visible. This is the moment where the craft turns from “sanding” to resin polishing: closing the cut, controlling heat, and stepping the abrasive system with intent until the surface stops being a surface and becomes a reflection.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing/cards/instagram/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing/cards/instagram/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing/cards/instagram/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing/cards/pinterest/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing/cards/pinterest/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing/cards/pinterest/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>9</readingTime></item><item><title>Let Epoxy Cure Fully Before Sanding</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 07 Nov 2025 16:25:05 +0000</pubDate><category>Plastic &amp; Epoxy Sanding</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-360</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit progression</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>Learn why letting epoxy fully cure before sanding is essential, plus timelines, tests, grit progressions, and pro tips for flawless, clear finishes.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="epoxy-sanding-why-waiting-to-cure-pays-off"&gt;Epoxy Sanding: Why Waiting to Cure Pays Off&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a point in every resin project when anticipation and restraint collide. You’ve de‑molded a river board you poured last weekend or set down a glossy flood coat on a tabletop, and the surface is whispering promises of glass-like clarity. You picture the final reveal: the light catching the grain, the resin depth turning everyday moments into a small ceremony. You also see the last mile between what is and what could be—the smoothing, refining, and polishing phase—also known as epoxy sanding. Your hands ache to pick up the sander. But this is where patience protects your craftsmanship.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding/cards/instagram/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding/cards/instagram/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding/cards/instagram/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding/cards/pinterest/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding/cards/pinterest/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding/cards/pinterest/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Keep Surfaces Flat With Rigid Blocks</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 05 Nov 2025 15:23:32 +0000</pubDate><category>Sanding Blocks</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>sanding block</category><description>Learn how rigid sanding blocks keep surfaces flat, when to use them, and the techniques, materials, and tips that deliver flawless, true results.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="keep-surfaces-flat-with-a-rigid-sanding-block"&gt;Keep Surfaces Flat with a Rigid Sanding Block&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a moment in any refinishing project when your eye catches the light just right and you see it: subtle waves in a tabletop, a faint ripple in primer, a break in the reflections across a glossy guitar body. You feel it with your fingertips too—those barely-there rises and dips that make the difference between “good enough” and “crafted.” I remember the first time I noticed how my results changed when I switched from a soft pad to a rigid sanding block. The surface I thought was “close” suddenly told the truth. Within a few careful passes, the highs dulled evenly and the lows showed as untouched pencil marks. In minutes, the surface was flatter than I’d ever achieved before.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/cards/facebook/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/cards/facebook/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/cards/facebook/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/cards/instagram/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/cards/instagram/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/cards/instagram/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/cards/facebook/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/cards/facebook/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/cards/facebook/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>13</readingTime></item><item><title>Best Wet Sanding Sequence For Plastic Headlight Lenses</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 05 Nov 2025 03:51:43 +0000</pubDate><category>Headlight Restoration</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-1200</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-2500</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>A precise, technical guide to wet lens sanding for plastic headlights—abrasives, workflows, and UV protection to restore clear, durable optics.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="best-lens-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlights"&gt;Best Lens Sanding Sequence for Plastic Headlights&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twilight is the worst time to discover your headlights are lying to you. Streetlights smear into blurry halos; lane markers fade into a matte wash. You feel yourself leaning forward in the seat as if posture could coax more lumens from the housings. But the problem isn’t the bulb; it’s the lens. Polycarbonate oxidizes, turns porous, and grows a diffuse surface that scatters light instead of transmitting it. That’s fixable if you stop thinking of restoration as a wipe-on miracle and start treating it like precision surface engineering. This guide is about real lens sanding—structured, wet, and sequential—not guessing with a single pad until it “looks better.”&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding/cards/facebook/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding/cards/facebook/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding/cards/facebook/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding/cards/instagram/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding/cards/instagram/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding/cards/instagram/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding/cards/pinterest/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding/cards/pinterest/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding/cards/pinterest/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding/cards/facebook/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding/cards/facebook/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding/cards/facebook/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>How To Repair Chipped Or Lifting Veneer Before Refinishing</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-repair-chipped-or-lifting-veneer-before-refinishing-furniture-restoration/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-repair-chipped-or-lifting-veneer-before-refinishing-furniture-restoration/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 04 Nov 2025 15:40:12 +0000</pubDate><category>Furniture Refinishing</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-1000</category><description>Learn how to repair chipped or lifting veneer before refinishing.

&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning, shop lights warm, coffee cooling on the bench. I slide a hand over a walnut dresser that’s outlived two generations. It has presence—clean lines, true drawers, the kind of proportions you can’t fake—but the veneer tells a rougher story. One front edge is chipped back to the substrate. A corner has lifted into a sharp little tent. Water once sat beneath a pot, raising a blister the size of a thumb. You could pass this piece over at a thrift store and never know what it could become. Or you can see it for what it is: a solid candidate for furniture restoration with a few smart, careful veneer repairs.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-repair-chipped-or-lifting-veneer-before-refinishing-furniture-restoration/cards/facebook/how-to-repair-chipped-or-lifting-veneer-before-refinishing-furniture-restoration.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-repair-chipped-or-lifting-veneer-before-refinishing-furniture-restoration/cards/facebook/how-to-repair-chipped-or-lifting-veneer-before-refinishing-furniture-restoration.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-repair-chipped-or-lifting-veneer-before-refinishing-furniture-restoration/cards/facebook/how-to-repair-chipped-or-lifting-veneer-before-refinishing-furniture-restoration.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-repair-chipped-or-lifting-veneer-before-refinishing-furniture-restoration/cards/instagram/how-to-repair-chipped-or-lifting-veneer-before-refinishing-furniture-restoration.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-repair-chipped-or-lifting-veneer-before-refinishing-furniture-restoration/cards/instagram/how-to-repair-chipped-or-lifting-veneer-before-refinishing-furniture-restoration.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-repair-chipped-or-lifting-veneer-before-refinishing-furniture-restoration/cards/instagram/how-to-repair-chipped-or-lifting-veneer-before-refinishing-furniture-restoration.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-repair-chipped-or-lifting-veneer-before-refinishing-furniture-restoration/cards/pinterest/how-to-repair-chipped-or-lifting-veneer-before-refinishing-furniture-restoration.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-repair-chipped-or-lifting-veneer-before-refinishing-furniture-restoration/cards/pinterest/how-to-repair-chipped-or-lifting-veneer-before-refinishing-furniture-restoration.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-repair-chipped-or-lifting-veneer-before-refinishing-furniture-restoration/cards/pinterest/how-to-repair-chipped-or-lifting-veneer-before-refinishing-furniture-restoration.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-repair-chipped-or-lifting-veneer-before-refinishing-furniture-restoration/cards/facebook/how-to-repair-chipped-or-lifting-veneer-before-refinishing-furniture-restoration.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-repair-chipped-or-lifting-veneer-before-refinishing-furniture-restoration/cards/facebook/how-to-repair-chipped-or-lifting-veneer-before-refinishing-furniture-restoration.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-repair-chipped-or-lifting-veneer-before-refinishing-furniture-restoration/cards/facebook/how-to-repair-chipped-or-lifting-veneer-before-refinishing-furniture-restoration.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Raise The Grain With Water Before Final Sanding</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/raise-the-grain-with-water-before-final-sanding-grain-preparation/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/raise-the-grain-with-water-before-final-sanding-grain-preparation/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 04 Nov 2025 13:36:49 +0000</pubDate><category>Wood sanding</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Engineer-tested methods for grain preparation: why wet-raising wood before final sanding improves stain uniformity and surface smoothness.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="grain-preparation-raise-the-grain-before-final-sanding"&gt;Grain Preparation: Raise the Grain Before Final Sanding&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first time I watched a walnut tabletop go from silky-smooth to prickly in minutes, I winced. I had sanded carefully through the grits, vacuumed, inspected under raking light—then I misted it with water. Within ten minutes, tiny “whiskers” stood up across the surface like a five o’clock shadow. If you’re new to this, the instinct is to panic. But as a product engineer who spends days measuring scratch patterns, fiber deformation, and finish adhesion, I’ve learned that moment is when control begins. What looks like backtracking is actually the most reliable path to a level, refined finish. It’s the heart of grain preparation.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/raise-the-grain-with-water-before-final-sanding-grain-preparation/cards/facebook/raise-the-grain-with-water-before-final-sanding-grain-preparation.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/raise-the-grain-with-water-before-final-sanding-grain-preparation/cards/facebook/raise-the-grain-with-water-before-final-sanding-grain-preparation.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/raise-the-grain-with-water-before-final-sanding-grain-preparation/cards/facebook/raise-the-grain-with-water-before-final-sanding-grain-preparation.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/raise-the-grain-with-water-before-final-sanding-grain-preparation/cards/instagram/raise-the-grain-with-water-before-final-sanding-grain-preparation.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/raise-the-grain-with-water-before-final-sanding-grain-preparation/cards/instagram/raise-the-grain-with-water-before-final-sanding-grain-preparation.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/raise-the-grain-with-water-before-final-sanding-grain-preparation/cards/instagram/raise-the-grain-with-water-before-final-sanding-grain-preparation.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/raise-the-grain-with-water-before-final-sanding-grain-preparation/cards/pinterest/raise-the-grain-with-water-before-final-sanding-grain-preparation.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/raise-the-grain-with-water-before-final-sanding-grain-preparation/cards/pinterest/raise-the-grain-with-water-before-final-sanding-grain-preparation.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/raise-the-grain-with-water-before-final-sanding-grain-preparation/cards/pinterest/raise-the-grain-with-water-before-final-sanding-grain-preparation.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/raise-the-grain-with-water-before-final-sanding-grain-preparation/cards/facebook/raise-the-grain-with-water-before-final-sanding-grain-preparation.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/raise-the-grain-with-water-before-final-sanding-grain-preparation/cards/facebook/raise-the-grain-with-water-before-final-sanding-grain-preparation.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/raise-the-grain-with-water-before-final-sanding-grain-preparation/cards/facebook/raise-the-grain-with-water-before-final-sanding-grain-preparation.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>How To Sand Wood By Hand For Smooth Finish</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 04 Nov 2025 03:41:00 +0000</pubDate><category>Hand Sanding Techniques</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>sanding block</category><category>grit progression</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>Learn hand sanding techniques, grit progression, and pro tips to achieve a flawless smooth wood finish with clear steps, tools, and troubleshooting.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="hand-sanding-for-a-glass-smooth-wood-finish"&gt;Hand sanding for a glass-smooth wood finish&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a quiet Saturday morning, the house is still enough to hear the tiny rasp of paper against wood. Sunlight falls across the table you’ve promised to restore—the one that’s been gathering keys, grocery bags, and happy-hour mail for years. At first glance, it seems fine. But run your fingertips from the center to the edge and you can feel a map of dents, glue drips, and faint chatter lines left by the last sander. This is where patience matters. This is where hand sanding earns its reputation.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding/cards/instagram/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding/cards/instagram/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding/cards/instagram/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Sic Versus Aluminum Oxide Differences</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 04 Nov 2025 02:51:33 +0000</pubDate><category>Abrasive Materials &amp; Compounds</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>dry sanding</category><category>clear coat</category><category>orbital sander</category><category>sanding block</category><description>Compare silicon carbide sandpaper and aluminum oxide to choose the right abrasive for wood, metal, and paint.

&lt;p&gt;On a quiet Saturday afternoon, you clamp down the last door of that heirloom dresser you’ve been restoring. The grain finally shows through the old varnish, but the surface still isn’t the mirror-smooth finish you pictured. You reach for a fresh sheet, feel the grit with your thumb, and hesitate—this is where the choice between silicon carbide sandpaper and aluminum oxide decides whether you’ll spend the evening admiring your work or chasing scratches you didn’t mean to make. Maybe you’re here because a paint finish went cloudy after dry sanding, or a clear coat took a hopscotch of swirls under shop lights. Or maybe your belt sander chewed through hook-and-loop discs like a wood chipper and you need something tougher and more predictable.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/instagram/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/instagram/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/instagram/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>13</readingTime></item><item><title>Progress From Metal Bond To Resin Pads</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/progress-from-metal-bond-to-resin-pads-concrete-polishing/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/progress-from-metal-bond-to-resin-pads-concrete-polishing/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 04 Nov 2025 01:54:08 +0000</pubDate><category>Stone &amp; Concrete Polishing</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Learn how to progress from metal bond to resin pads in concrete polishing with clear grit sequences, on-site tips, and pro workflows that deliver mirror</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="concrete-polishing-metal-to-resin-pad-mastery"&gt;Concrete Polishing: Metal to Resin Pad Mastery&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a moment in every shop or garage when the floor starts to tell your story. Early morning light spills under the door; you flick on the grinder, and the air lifts just a little with the smell of damp concrete and sawdust from yesterday’s build. You set your coffee down, lace up, and eye the slab—dusty in patches, shiny where years of foot traffic have burnished a path to your bench. This is where concrete polishing earns its keep. It’s not just about gloss. It’s about turning a stained, work-weary surface into a durable, cleanable plane that makes every task feel smoother. And like any good build, the finish depends on the foundation: the right tools, the right sequence, and the discipline to switch from metal to resin at the exact right moment.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/progress-from-metal-bond-to-resin-pads-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/progress-from-metal-bond-to-resin-pads-concrete-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/progress-from-metal-bond-to-resin-pads-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/progress-from-metal-bond-to-resin-pads-concrete-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/progress-from-metal-bond-to-resin-pads-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/progress-from-metal-bond-to-resin-pads-concrete-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/progress-from-metal-bond-to-resin-pads-concrete-polishing/cards/instagram/progress-from-metal-bond-to-resin-pads-concrete-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/progress-from-metal-bond-to-resin-pads-concrete-polishing/cards/instagram/progress-from-metal-bond-to-resin-pads-concrete-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/progress-from-metal-bond-to-resin-pads-concrete-polishing/cards/instagram/progress-from-metal-bond-to-resin-pads-concrete-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/progress-from-metal-bond-to-resin-pads-concrete-polishing/cards/pinterest/progress-from-metal-bond-to-resin-pads-concrete-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/progress-from-metal-bond-to-resin-pads-concrete-polishing/cards/pinterest/progress-from-metal-bond-to-resin-pads-concrete-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/progress-from-metal-bond-to-resin-pads-concrete-polishing/cards/pinterest/progress-from-metal-bond-to-resin-pads-concrete-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/progress-from-metal-bond-to-resin-pads-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/progress-from-metal-bond-to-resin-pads-concrete-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/progress-from-metal-bond-to-resin-pads-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/progress-from-metal-bond-to-resin-pads-concrete-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/progress-from-metal-bond-to-resin-pads-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/progress-from-metal-bond-to-resin-pads-concrete-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>15</readingTime></item><item><title>Polish Epoxy Resin To Glass Like Finish</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 21:00:08 +0000</pubDate><category>Resin Polishing</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-1500</category><description>Learn how to polish epoxy resin to a glass-like finish with step-by-step sanding, heat control, compounds, and pro tips for durable clarity.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="resin-polishing-for-a-glass-like-epoxy-finish"&gt;Resin Polishing for a Glass-Like Epoxy Finish&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first time you run a fingertip across an epoxy surface, it’s a little magic trick. The light catches, colors bloom, and you expect the kind of clarity you see on showroom glass. But if you’ve poured, leveled, and cured resin yourself, you also know the moment that follows: under sunlight or a raking lamp, faint haze, scratch patterns, or tiny undulations whisper that the job isn’t quite done. That’s where resonant craftsmanship meets patience—where resin polishing turns a good pour into a gleaming, glass-like finish.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing/cards/instagram/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing/cards/instagram/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing/cards/instagram/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing/cards/pinterest/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing/cards/pinterest/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing/cards/pinterest/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>14</readingTime></item><item><title>Soak Time For Wet Sanding Papers</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 19:47:57 +0000</pubDate><category>Waterproof &amp; Wet/Dry Paper</category><category>grit-280</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-1200</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>wet sanding</category><description>Learn the optimal soak times for wet dry sandpaper, how soaking affects abrasive performance, and precise workflows for wood, paint, and metal.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="wet-dry-sandpaper-soak-times-a-technical-guide"&gt;Wet Dry Sandpaper Soak Times: A Technical Guide&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shop is quiet except for the slow drip from a rinse bottle, pooling across a workbench where a clear-coated guitar body breathes under the lights. There’s a shallow tray of clean water, a few folded sheets of wet dry sandpaper, and a foam pad waiting like a promise. You press a fingertip to the lacquer—weeks of curing have left it hard, crisp, and unforgiving. You remember the last time you rushed the process and chased pigtails under a glaring shop light. Not today. Today, the water will do its work before the first stroke lands.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/instagram/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/instagram/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/instagram/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Difference Between Compounding And Polishing</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 02:16:29 +0000</pubDate><category>Polishing &amp; Finishing</category><category>mirror finish</category><category>polishing pads</category><category>grit progression</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-1200</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>clear coat</category><description>Learn the difference between compounding and polishing, how to choose polishing sandpaper and pads, and the step-by-step process for flawless finishes.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="compounding-vs-polishing-guide-to-polishing-sandpaper"&gt;Compounding vs Polishing: Guide to Polishing Sandpaper&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a moment every craftsperson recognizes: you step into the garage or studio, sunlight cuts across a painted panel or tabletop, and you see everything—swirls you never meant to leave, scratches that catch the light just so, a haze that dulls the color you spent hours applying. Your instinct might be to reach for the strongest product you own, but knowing the difference between compounding and polishing—and where polishing sandpaper fits—can save time, material, and the finish you’re trying to protect. Maybe it’s the clear coat on your daily driver, the lacquer on a guitar body, or the resin on a turned pen blank. Different surfaces, same goal: remove defects while preserving as much material as possible.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper/cards/instagram/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper/cards/instagram/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper/cards/instagram/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item></channel></rss>

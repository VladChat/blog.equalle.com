&lt;p&gt;Most of us have lived this scene: you tape off a narrow bead on a furniture leg, or cradle a sculpted car fender from a scale kit, intent on smoothing a few primer nibs. You reach for a sanding sponge because it feels safe and forgiving. Minutes later, the high spot that gave the profile its character looks muted. The curve is still there, but its line lost energy—softened by a tool that seemed tailor-made for finesse. As a product engineer and tester, I’ve flattened enough edges to learn that it isn’t clumsiness; it’s physics and material behavior conspiring against you.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/26.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/08/avoid-flattening-detail-with-flexible-sponge-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/avoid-flattening-detail-with-flexible-sponge-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/08/avoid-flattening-detail-with-flexible-sponge-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/avoid-flattening-detail-with-flexible-sponge-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/08/avoid-flattening-detail-with-flexible-sponge-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/avoid-flattening-detail-with-flexible-sponge-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/08/avoid-flattening-detail-with-flexible-sponge-sanding-sponge/cards/instagram/avoid-flattening-detail-with-flexible-sponge-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/08/avoid-flattening-detail-with-flexible-sponge-sanding-sponge/cards/instagram/avoid-flattening-detail-with-flexible-sponge-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/08/avoid-flattening-detail-with-flexible-sponge-sanding-sponge/cards/instagram/avoid-flattening-detail-with-flexible-sponge-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/08/avoid-flattening-detail-with-flexible-sponge-sanding-sponge/cards/pinterest/avoid-flattening-detail-with-flexible-sponge-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/08/avoid-flattening-detail-with-flexible-sponge-sanding-sponge/cards/pinterest/avoid-flattening-detail-with-flexible-sponge-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/08/avoid-flattening-detail-with-flexible-sponge-sanding-sponge/cards/pinterest/avoid-flattening-detail-with-flexible-sponge-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/08/avoid-flattening-detail-with-flexible-sponge-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/avoid-flattening-detail-with-flexible-sponge-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/08/avoid-flattening-detail-with-flexible-sponge-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/avoid-flattening-detail-with-flexible-sponge-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/08/avoid-flattening-detail-with-flexible-sponge-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/avoid-flattening-detail-with-flexible-sponge-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Match Block Hardness To The Surface Shape</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/07/match-block-hardness-to-the-surface-shape-sanding-block/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/07/match-block-hardness-to-the-surface-shape-sanding-block/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 07 Feb 2026 16:57:40 +0000</pubDate><category>Sanding Blocks</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>sanding block</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Learn how to match sanding block hardness to surface geometry for flat panels, contours, and edges.

&lt;p&gt;The memory is small but vivid: a late evening in the garage, raking light across a cherry drawer front that looked perfect from a distance. Under the lamp, the truth appeared—uneven sheen, slight hollows near the pull recess, and a treacherously rounded lower edge. Hours of sanding, and I had softened the geometry I meant to preserve. The culprit wasn’t the grit or the wood species; it was the mismatch between the workpiece shape and the hardness of the sanding block in my hand. I was using a foam block on flats that demanded something rigid, and a rigid block on contours that needed controlled compliance. That night I learned that selecting the correct backing hardness is as fundamental as choosing the right abrasive.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/24.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/07/match-block-hardness-to-the-surface-shape-sanding-block/cards/facebook/match-block-hardness-to-the-surface-shape-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/07/match-block-hardness-to-the-surface-shape-sanding-block/cards/facebook/match-block-hardness-to-the-surface-shape-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/07/match-block-hardness-to-the-surface-shape-sanding-block/cards/facebook/match-block-hardness-to-the-surface-shape-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/07/match-block-hardness-to-the-surface-shape-sanding-block/cards/instagram/match-block-hardness-to-the-surface-shape-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/07/match-block-hardness-to-the-surface-shape-sanding-block/cards/instagram/match-block-hardness-to-the-surface-shape-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/07/match-block-hardness-to-the-surface-shape-sanding-block/cards/instagram/match-block-hardness-to-the-surface-shape-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/07/match-block-hardness-to-the-surface-shape-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/match-block-hardness-to-the-surface-shape-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/07/match-block-hardness-to-the-surface-shape-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/match-block-hardness-to-the-surface-shape-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/07/match-block-hardness-to-the-surface-shape-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/match-block-hardness-to-the-surface-shape-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/07/match-block-hardness-to-the-surface-shape-sanding-block/cards/facebook/match-block-hardness-to-the-surface-shape-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/07/match-block-hardness-to-the-surface-shape-sanding-block/cards/facebook/match-block-hardness-to-the-surface-shape-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/07/match-block-hardness-to-the-surface-shape-sanding-block/cards/facebook/match-block-hardness-to-the-surface-shape-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Best Grit To Scuff Sand Previously Painted Baseboards</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/02/best-grit-to-scuff-sand-previously-painted-baseboards-baseboard-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/02/best-grit-to-scuff-sand-previously-painted-baseboards-baseboard-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 14:57:53 +0000</pubDate><category>Trim &amp; Molding Sanding</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>Find the best grit to scuff sand previously painted baseboards.

&lt;p&gt;By the time the morning light sweeps across the hallway, every flaw in your trim becomes a quiet distraction: a chipped edge near the doorstop, a line of roller orange peel above the shoe molding, the glossy band where furniture grazed the baseboard. You run a fingertip along a suspect stretch of paint, and it feels slick, impervious—more like a plastic shell than something ready to bond with a fresh coat. It’s a moment many of us know: the desire to fix everything before the day gets busy, weighed against the fear of making it worse. That’s exactly where baseboard sanding earns its keep. It’s the technician’s shortcut to predictability—matting the sheen, leveling micro-defects, and creating a uniformly keyed surface that primer and enamel can actually bite into.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/29.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/02/best-grit-to-scuff-sand-previously-painted-baseboards-baseboard-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-to-scuff-sand-previously-painted-baseboards-baseboard-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/02/best-grit-to-scuff-sand-previously-painted-baseboards-baseboard-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-to-scuff-sand-previously-painted-baseboards-baseboard-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/02/best-grit-to-scuff-sand-previously-painted-baseboards-baseboard-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-to-scuff-sand-previously-painted-baseboards-baseboard-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/02/best-grit-to-scuff-sand-previously-painted-baseboards-baseboard-sanding/cards/instagram/best-grit-to-scuff-sand-previously-painted-baseboards-baseboard-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/02/best-grit-to-scuff-sand-previously-painted-baseboards-baseboard-sanding/cards/instagram/best-grit-to-scuff-sand-previously-painted-baseboards-baseboard-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/02/best-grit-to-scuff-sand-previously-painted-baseboards-baseboard-sanding/cards/instagram/best-grit-to-scuff-sand-previously-painted-baseboards-baseboard-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/02/best-grit-to-scuff-sand-previously-painted-baseboards-baseboard-sanding/cards/pinterest/best-grit-to-scuff-sand-previously-painted-baseboards-baseboard-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/02/best-grit-to-scuff-sand-previously-painted-baseboards-baseboard-sanding/cards/pinterest/best-grit-to-scuff-sand-previously-painted-baseboards-baseboard-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/02/best-grit-to-scuff-sand-previously-painted-baseboards-baseboard-sanding/cards/pinterest/best-grit-to-scuff-sand-previously-painted-baseboards-baseboard-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/02/best-grit-to-scuff-sand-previously-painted-baseboards-baseboard-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-to-scuff-sand-previously-painted-baseboards-baseboard-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/02/best-grit-to-scuff-sand-previously-painted-baseboards-baseboard-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-to-scuff-sand-previously-painted-baseboards-baseboard-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/02/best-grit-to-scuff-sand-previously-painted-baseboards-baseboard-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-to-scuff-sand-previously-painted-baseboards-baseboard-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Support And Availability Of Grits</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/30/support-and-availability-of-grits-best-sandpaper-brand/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/30/support-and-availability-of-grits-best-sandpaper-brand/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 14:01:33 +0000</pubDate><category>Brand &amp; Quality Comparison</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-280</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><description>A workshop guide to picking the best sandpaper brand with the right grit range, formats, and support—plus real sanding sequences and pro tips.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="choosing-the-best-sandpaper-brand-for-every-grit"&gt;Choosing the Best Sandpaper Brand for Every Grit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Late Sunday, the shop is warm and a little loud—random orbitals humming, shop vac pulling a steady whirr, and a maple tabletop glowing under fresh shellac. You’re feeling that flow where the dust hangs like a halo and every pass lines up with the grain just right. Then it happens: you reach for P320 to close the gap between P240 and P400… and the drawer is empty. You try P280 from another pack but it’s a different brand; the cut is jumpier, the stearate loads different, and the paper tears at the clip. Now you’ve got swirl marks, a 30-minute detour to the store, and a finish window slipping away. That’s the moment you learn that the best sandpaper brand isn’t just about how sharp the grit is or how long it lasts—it’s about support, continuity, and having the right grits in the formats you use, when you need them.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/17.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/30/support-and-availability-of-grits-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/facebook/support-and-availability-of-grits-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/30/support-and-availability-of-grits-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/facebook/support-and-availability-of-grits-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/30/support-and-availability-of-grits-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/facebook/support-and-availability-of-grits-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/30/support-and-availability-of-grits-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/instagram/support-and-availability-of-grits-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/30/support-and-availability-of-grits-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/instagram/support-and-availability-of-grits-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/30/support-and-availability-of-grits-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/instagram/support-and-availability-of-grits-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/30/support-and-availability-of-grits-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/pinterest/support-and-availability-of-grits-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/30/support-and-availability-of-grits-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/pinterest/support-and-availability-of-grits-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/30/support-and-availability-of-grits-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/pinterest/support-and-availability-of-grits-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/30/support-and-availability-of-grits-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/facebook/support-and-availability-of-grits-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/30/support-and-availability-of-grits-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/facebook/support-and-availability-of-grits-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/30/support-and-availability-of-grits-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/facebook/support-and-availability-of-grits-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>13</readingTime></item><item><title>Inspect Under Raking Light For Chips</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/27/inspect-under-raking-light-for-chips-glass-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/27/inspect-under-raking-light-for-chips-glass-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 13:54:02 +0000</pubDate><category>Glass &amp; Ceramics Sanding</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1200</category><category>grit progression</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>sanding block</category><description>Learn how to inspect glass under raking light for chips, then repair and polish with controlled glass sanding, grit sequencing, and safety.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="raking-light-inspection-and-glass-sanding-basics"&gt;Raking Light Inspection and Glass Sanding Basics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A scratched backsplash, a hazy edge on a bottle you plan to turn into a lamp, the faint tick of a chip on a shower door—these are small things you don’t notice until the light hits just right. My moment was a kitchen island, late evening, phone flashlight resting on the quartz and aimed low across a new tempered-glass insert. In daylight it looked flawless. Under raking light, it told the truth: a constellation of micro-chips on the cut edge and a faint scratch arc where a coffee grinder once danced. I’ve worked on abrasive systems long enough to know two facts: defects hide in glare, and what you can’t see you can’t control. Raking light is the quickest way to see, and glass sanding—when done deliberately—is how you take control.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/07.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/27/inspect-under-raking-light-for-chips-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/inspect-under-raking-light-for-chips-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/27/inspect-under-raking-light-for-chips-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/inspect-under-raking-light-for-chips-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/27/inspect-under-raking-light-for-chips-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/inspect-under-raking-light-for-chips-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/27/inspect-under-raking-light-for-chips-glass-sanding/cards/instagram/inspect-under-raking-light-for-chips-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/27/inspect-under-raking-light-for-chips-glass-sanding/cards/instagram/inspect-under-raking-light-for-chips-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/27/inspect-under-raking-light-for-chips-glass-sanding/cards/instagram/inspect-under-raking-light-for-chips-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/27/inspect-under-raking-light-for-chips-glass-sanding/cards/pinterest/inspect-under-raking-light-for-chips-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/27/inspect-under-raking-light-for-chips-glass-sanding/cards/pinterest/inspect-under-raking-light-for-chips-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/27/inspect-under-raking-light-for-chips-glass-sanding/cards/pinterest/inspect-under-raking-light-for-chips-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/27/inspect-under-raking-light-for-chips-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/inspect-under-raking-light-for-chips-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/27/inspect-under-raking-light-for-chips-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/inspect-under-raking-light-for-chips-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/27/inspect-under-raking-light-for-chips-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/inspect-under-raking-light-for-chips-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Crosshatch Passes For Flat Panel Sanding</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/18/crosshatch-passes-for-flat-panel-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/18/crosshatch-passes-for-flat-panel-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 14:18:18 +0000</pubDate><category>Random Orbital Sanding</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-1000</category><description>Engineer-tested crosshatch passes for flat panel sanding with random orbital sanding.

&lt;p&gt;The first time I truly trusted a surface was under shop lights late on a Sunday, not at noon when everything looks perfect. I had a maple tabletop on trestles, pencil grid scribbled across the face, edges taped to protect the bevel. The shop was quiet except for the steady hum of the sander—a 5-inch random orbital—drawing dust through a tidy hose looped overhead. In that light, imperfections don’t yell; they whisper. High spots break the graphite lines first. Low spots hold onto them stubbornly. I moved the machine in a measured, crosshatch pattern, alternating angles like a metronome, and watched the pencil disappear in a uniform fade rather than blotches.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/04.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/18/crosshatch-passes-for-flat-panel-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/crosshatch-passes-for-flat-panel-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/18/crosshatch-passes-for-flat-panel-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/crosshatch-passes-for-flat-panel-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/18/crosshatch-passes-for-flat-panel-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/crosshatch-passes-for-flat-panel-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/18/crosshatch-passes-for-flat-panel-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/instagram/crosshatch-passes-for-flat-panel-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/18/crosshatch-passes-for-flat-panel-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/instagram/crosshatch-passes-for-flat-panel-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/18/crosshatch-passes-for-flat-panel-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/instagram/crosshatch-passes-for-flat-panel-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/18/crosshatch-passes-for-flat-panel-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/pinterest/crosshatch-passes-for-flat-panel-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/18/crosshatch-passes-for-flat-panel-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/pinterest/crosshatch-passes-for-flat-panel-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/18/crosshatch-passes-for-flat-panel-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/pinterest/crosshatch-passes-for-flat-panel-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/18/crosshatch-passes-for-flat-panel-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/crosshatch-passes-for-flat-panel-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/18/crosshatch-passes-for-flat-panel-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/crosshatch-passes-for-flat-panel-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/18/crosshatch-passes-for-flat-panel-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/crosshatch-passes-for-flat-panel-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>When To Choose Cloth Or Fiber Backings</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/07/when-to-choose-cloth-or-fiber-backings-open-coat-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/07/when-to-choose-cloth-or-fiber-backings-open-coat-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 15:23:39 +0000</pubDate><category>Backing Types &amp; Coatings</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><description>Learn when to choose cloth or fiber abrasive backings and how open coat sandpaper improves cut, reduces loading, and optimizes sanding workflows.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="cloth-vs-fiber-backings-with-open-coat-sandpaper"&gt;Cloth vs Fiber Backings with Open Coat Sandpaper&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It starts on a Saturday morning with a surface that matters. Maybe it’s a maple tabletop you milled last fall, or a set of welded brackets you promised to deliver before lunch. You switch on the dust extractor, index a fresh disc, and take the first pass. Within seconds, you know if the setup is right: the abrasive either cuts cleanly or smears; it either stays cool and sheds swarf or loads, glazing the face and burning the work. This isn’t luck. It’s backing selection, grain geometry, and coating density working together. For a lot of workflows—especially on resinous woods, body filler, aluminum, and painted surfaces—open coat sandpaper keeps the cut alive by leaving voids between abrasive grains that evacuate debris instead of embedding it. But even the right coat pattern underperforms if the backing can’t transmit force, resist heat, or conform to the surface you’re shaping.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/28.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/07/when-to-choose-cloth-or-fiber-backings-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-cloth-or-fiber-backings-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/07/when-to-choose-cloth-or-fiber-backings-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-cloth-or-fiber-backings-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/07/when-to-choose-cloth-or-fiber-backings-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-cloth-or-fiber-backings-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/07/when-to-choose-cloth-or-fiber-backings-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/instagram/when-to-choose-cloth-or-fiber-backings-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/07/when-to-choose-cloth-or-fiber-backings-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/instagram/when-to-choose-cloth-or-fiber-backings-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/07/when-to-choose-cloth-or-fiber-backings-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/instagram/when-to-choose-cloth-or-fiber-backings-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/07/when-to-choose-cloth-or-fiber-backings-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/when-to-choose-cloth-or-fiber-backings-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/07/when-to-choose-cloth-or-fiber-backings-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/when-to-choose-cloth-or-fiber-backings-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/07/when-to-choose-cloth-or-fiber-backings-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/when-to-choose-cloth-or-fiber-backings-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/07/when-to-choose-cloth-or-fiber-backings-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-cloth-or-fiber-backings-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/07/when-to-choose-cloth-or-fiber-backings-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-cloth-or-fiber-backings-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/07/when-to-choose-cloth-or-fiber-backings-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-cloth-or-fiber-backings-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Grit Sequence For Hardwood Versus Softwood</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/02/grit-sequence-for-hardwood-versus-softwood-sandpaper-grit-chart/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/02/grit-sequence-for-hardwood-versus-softwood-sandpaper-grit-chart/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 15:05:34 +0000</pubDate><category>Grit Guide &amp; Education</category><category>grit chart</category><category>abrasive standards</category><category>grit progression</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><description>Engineer-tested grit sequences for hardwood vs softwood, with a clear sandpaper grit chart, material science insights, and pro tips for faster, cleaner</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="sandpaper-grit-chart-hardwood-vs-softwood-guide"&gt;Sandpaper Grit Chart: Hardwood vs Softwood Guide&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a rainy Saturday in my small basement shop, I set a maple board on the bench next to a knotty piece of pine. The goal seemed simple: sand both to a flawless, finish-ready surface without wasting time or rounding edges. But if you’ve ever swapped back and forth between hardwood and softwood, you know the result can be anything but simple—soft pine can gum up a disc in minutes, while dense maple highlights every stray swirl you hoped wouldn’t show through the finish. I pulled out my sanding cart, a set of discs from P80 to P240, and the printed sandpaper grit chart I keep taped to a cabinet door. The right sequence is less about dogma and more about physics: grain hardness, resin content, abrasive mineral, and scratch geometry interacting in real time.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/06.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/02/grit-sequence-for-hardwood-versus-softwood-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/grit-sequence-for-hardwood-versus-softwood-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/02/grit-sequence-for-hardwood-versus-softwood-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/grit-sequence-for-hardwood-versus-softwood-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/02/grit-sequence-for-hardwood-versus-softwood-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/grit-sequence-for-hardwood-versus-softwood-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/02/grit-sequence-for-hardwood-versus-softwood-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/instagram/grit-sequence-for-hardwood-versus-softwood-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/02/grit-sequence-for-hardwood-versus-softwood-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/instagram/grit-sequence-for-hardwood-versus-softwood-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/02/grit-sequence-for-hardwood-versus-softwood-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/instagram/grit-sequence-for-hardwood-versus-softwood-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/02/grit-sequence-for-hardwood-versus-softwood-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/pinterest/grit-sequence-for-hardwood-versus-softwood-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/02/grit-sequence-for-hardwood-versus-softwood-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/pinterest/grit-sequence-for-hardwood-versus-softwood-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/02/grit-sequence-for-hardwood-versus-softwood-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/pinterest/grit-sequence-for-hardwood-versus-softwood-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/02/grit-sequence-for-hardwood-versus-softwood-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/grit-sequence-for-hardwood-versus-softwood-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/02/grit-sequence-for-hardwood-versus-softwood-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/grit-sequence-for-hardwood-versus-softwood-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/02/grit-sequence-for-hardwood-versus-softwood-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/grit-sequence-for-hardwood-versus-softwood-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>13</readingTime></item><item><title>Soft Interface Pad For Contour Sanding</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 13:38:32 +0000</pubDate><category>Hook-and-Loop Discs</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1200</category><description>Engineer-tested guide to soft interface pads for contour sanding and hook and loop sanding discs—materials, heat control, dust, and real-world results.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="hook-and-loop-sanding-discs-and-soft-interface-pads"&gt;Hook and Loop Sanding Discs and Soft Interface Pads&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early Sunday, the shop is quiet except for the soft thrum of a random-orbit sander. You’re easing into the inside radius of a chair arm, the kind of curve where the wood tells on you: one careless second and you’ve burned through stain on the edge. You swap to a softer setup—an interface pad between the pad and your hook and loop sanding discs—and the whole feel changes. The pad yields just enough to keep the abrasive in full contact along the curve, and the sander stops chattering. Your hands relax. The dust stream settles into the vacuum instead of fogging the bench light. The finish doesn’t scream for attention anymore; it whispers that you got the contour right.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/27.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Dust Extraction Setup For Belt Sanding</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/31/dust-extraction-setup-for-belt-sanding-sanding-belts/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/31/dust-extraction-setup-for-belt-sanding-sanding-belts/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 15:08:04 +0000</pubDate><category>Sanding Belts &amp; Machines</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-240</category><category>dust control</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Engineer a clean, safe, and efficient dust extraction setup for belt sanding with practical airflow targets, filtration choices, and abrasive performance tips.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="dust-extraction-setup-for-sanding-belts"&gt;Dust Extraction Setup for Sanding Belts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first time you switch on a belt sander in a quiet shop, the machine’s hum is almost soothing—until the air turns hazy and you feel grit settling on your forearms, your workbench, and the freshly glued panels waiting for finish. Dust isn’t just a nuisance; it’s process noise that blocks your ability to see scratch patterns, compromises adhesive bonds, and creates finish defects that telegraph through the final sheen. If you rely on sanding belts to prep edges, flatten stock, or break sharp corners, a sloppy extraction setup costs you time and quality. The target is not “less dust.” It’s controlled capture at the source, predictable airflow, and filtration that returns clean air to your breathing zone without starving your sander’s performance.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/25.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/31/dust-extraction-setup-for-belt-sanding-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/dust-extraction-setup-for-belt-sanding-sanding-belts.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/31/dust-extraction-setup-for-belt-sanding-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/dust-extraction-setup-for-belt-sanding-sanding-belts.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/31/dust-extraction-setup-for-belt-sanding-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/dust-extraction-setup-for-belt-sanding-sanding-belts.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/31/dust-extraction-setup-for-belt-sanding-sanding-belts/cards/instagram/dust-extraction-setup-for-belt-sanding-sanding-belts.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/31/dust-extraction-setup-for-belt-sanding-sanding-belts/cards/instagram/dust-extraction-setup-for-belt-sanding-sanding-belts.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/31/dust-extraction-setup-for-belt-sanding-sanding-belts/cards/instagram/dust-extraction-setup-for-belt-sanding-sanding-belts.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/31/dust-extraction-setup-for-belt-sanding-sanding-belts/cards/pinterest/dust-extraction-setup-for-belt-sanding-sanding-belts.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/31/dust-extraction-setup-for-belt-sanding-sanding-belts/cards/pinterest/dust-extraction-setup-for-belt-sanding-sanding-belts.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/31/dust-extraction-setup-for-belt-sanding-sanding-belts/cards/pinterest/dust-extraction-setup-for-belt-sanding-sanding-belts.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/31/dust-extraction-setup-for-belt-sanding-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/dust-extraction-setup-for-belt-sanding-sanding-belts.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/31/dust-extraction-setup-for-belt-sanding-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/dust-extraction-setup-for-belt-sanding-sanding-belts.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/31/dust-extraction-setup-for-belt-sanding-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/dust-extraction-setup-for-belt-sanding-sanding-belts.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Clean A Sanding Sponge To Restore Cut</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/31/clean-a-sanding-sponge-to-restore-cut-sanding-sponge/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/31/clean-a-sanding-sponge-to-restore-cut-sanding-sponge/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 13:37:47 +0000</pubDate><category>Sanding Sponges</category><category>grit-240</category><description>Revive clogged sanding sponges fast.

&lt;p&gt;You notice it mid-stroke: the surface stops changing, and the sound of sanding turns from a crisp hiss to a dull whisper. Your palm is steady, the motion is right—yet the finish barely budges. It’s not your technique. It’s the tool. The sanding sponge that felt sharp yesterday is now glazed with fine dust, paint nibs, and resin. You could toss it, but there’s a better, thriftier, and more sustainable option: clean it to restore the cut.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/23.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/31/clean-a-sanding-sponge-to-restore-cut-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/clean-a-sanding-sponge-to-restore-cut-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/31/clean-a-sanding-sponge-to-restore-cut-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/clean-a-sanding-sponge-to-restore-cut-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/31/clean-a-sanding-sponge-to-restore-cut-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/clean-a-sanding-sponge-to-restore-cut-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/31/clean-a-sanding-sponge-to-restore-cut-sanding-sponge/cards/instagram/clean-a-sanding-sponge-to-restore-cut-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/31/clean-a-sanding-sponge-to-restore-cut-sanding-sponge/cards/instagram/clean-a-sanding-sponge-to-restore-cut-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/31/clean-a-sanding-sponge-to-restore-cut-sanding-sponge/cards/instagram/clean-a-sanding-sponge-to-restore-cut-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/31/clean-a-sanding-sponge-to-restore-cut-sanding-sponge/cards/pinterest/clean-a-sanding-sponge-to-restore-cut-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/31/clean-a-sanding-sponge-to-restore-cut-sanding-sponge/cards/pinterest/clean-a-sanding-sponge-to-restore-cut-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/31/clean-a-sanding-sponge-to-restore-cut-sanding-sponge/cards/pinterest/clean-a-sanding-sponge-to-restore-cut-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/31/clean-a-sanding-sponge-to-restore-cut-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/clean-a-sanding-sponge-to-restore-cut-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/31/clean-a-sanding-sponge-to-restore-cut-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/clean-a-sanding-sponge-to-restore-cut-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/31/clean-a-sanding-sponge-to-restore-cut-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/clean-a-sanding-sponge-to-restore-cut-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Cross Sanding Method For Leveling Panels</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 15:55:05 +0000</pubDate><category>Sanding Blocks</category><category>grit-240</category><category>sanding block</category><category>clear coat</category><category>orbital sander</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Learn the cross sanding method for leveling panels.

&lt;p&gt;The first time you chase “flat” across a panel, it sneaks up on you. Early morning, bench light low and raking, coffee cooling by the vise. You sight across a tabletop you’ve glued up—a handsome mix of maple and walnut—certain you nailed the clamps this time. But you feel it before you see it: the slightest rise where two boards meet, a shallow dish near one corner that catches the light like a ripple on a still pond. It’s not bad, but it’s enough to make a finish telegraph every imperfection. You could reach for a random orbital and it would eventually get you there, but it’s like mowing a lawn in circles. There’s a faster, more controlled way to true a surface: cross sanding with a sanding block.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/21.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block/cards/facebook/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block/cards/facebook/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block/cards/facebook/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block/cards/instagram/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block/cards/instagram/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block/cards/instagram/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block/cards/facebook/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block/cards/facebook/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block/cards/facebook/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Sequence Grits For Profiles And Corners</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 14:25:34 +0000</pubDate><category>Detail Sander Sheets</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><description>Engineer’s guide to sequencing grits for profiles and corners with detail sander sheets, including test-backed grit orders and pro tips for crisp edges</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="detail-sander-sheets-sequencing-grits-for-profiles"&gt;Detail sander sheets: sequencing grits for profiles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a Saturday morning in the shop, you pull the tape off a freshly routed maple picture frame and hit it with raking light. The ogee looks clean at first glance—but your fingertips catch tiny ridges where the cutter eased in and out, and the inside corners still show faint milling lines. You grab a delta sander, slide on a fresh pack of detail sander sheets, and take a breath. This is the moment that separates a merely “good enough” piece from one that reads crisp at arm’s length and holds up under a client’s inspection light.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/19.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets/cards/instagram/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets/cards/instagram/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets/cards/instagram/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets/cards/pinterest/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets/cards/pinterest/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets/cards/pinterest/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>13</readingTime></item><item><title>Proper Hand Pressure And Speed Control</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/proper-hand-pressure-and-speed-control-random-orbital-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/proper-hand-pressure-and-speed-control-random-orbital-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 13:42:18 +0000</pubDate><category>Random Orbital Sanding</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-2100</category><category>orbital sander</category><description>Master hand pressure and speed control for random orbital sanding to boost surface prep quality, abrasive life, and finish consistency.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="random-orbital-sanding-pressure-and-speed-mastery"&gt;Random Orbital Sanding: Pressure and Speed Mastery&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning, shop lights humming, a fresh cup of coffee cooling beside a maple tabletop you’ve been saving for months. You click on the extractor, roll the hose into your elbow, and set the 5&amp;quot; sander on the surface. The pad spins up with that familiar soft whir. You start at the far corner, let the tool’s own weight settle, and begin to track across the grain. Two passes in, you see it: faint pigtails reflecting in the raking light. You aren’t new to sanding; you’re careful with grits, dust removal, and vacuum airflow. But random orbital sanding still has a way of punishing rushed technique. You realize your grip has tightened and your forearm is leaning into the head—too much pressure. The speed dial is still at max from the last adhesive removal task. Heat builds, the abrasive dulls, and the swirl gremlins come to life.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/17.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/proper-hand-pressure-and-speed-control-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/proper-hand-pressure-and-speed-control-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/proper-hand-pressure-and-speed-control-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/proper-hand-pressure-and-speed-control-random-orbital-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/proper-hand-pressure-and-speed-control-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/proper-hand-pressure-and-speed-control-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/proper-hand-pressure-and-speed-control-random-orbital-sanding/cards/instagram/proper-hand-pressure-and-speed-control-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/proper-hand-pressure-and-speed-control-random-orbital-sanding/cards/instagram/proper-hand-pressure-and-speed-control-random-orbital-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/proper-hand-pressure-and-speed-control-random-orbital-sanding/cards/instagram/proper-hand-pressure-and-speed-control-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/proper-hand-pressure-and-speed-control-random-orbital-sanding/cards/pinterest/proper-hand-pressure-and-speed-control-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/proper-hand-pressure-and-speed-control-random-orbital-sanding/cards/pinterest/proper-hand-pressure-and-speed-control-random-orbital-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/proper-hand-pressure-and-speed-control-random-orbital-sanding/cards/pinterest/proper-hand-pressure-and-speed-control-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/proper-hand-pressure-and-speed-control-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/proper-hand-pressure-and-speed-control-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/proper-hand-pressure-and-speed-control-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/proper-hand-pressure-and-speed-control-random-orbital-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/proper-hand-pressure-and-speed-control-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/proper-hand-pressure-and-speed-control-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Recycling Options For Used Abrasives</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/recycling-options-for-used-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/recycling-options-for-used-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 20 Dec 2025 15:27:17 +0000</pubDate><category>Eco &amp; Non-Toxic Abrasives</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>dry sanding</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Tested routes to recycle used abrasives—eco sandpaper, belts, discs, and media—with data-driven tips, partner options, and shop-ready sorting methods.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="eco-sandpaper-recycling-practical-paths-that-work"&gt;Eco Sandpaper Recycling: Practical Paths That Work&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning, the garage smells like cedar and coffee. My benchtop sander hums a steady rhythm while early light catches the swirls of dust in the air. I’m finishing a bookshelf for my daughter’s room, working through the grits like a metronome: P80, P120, P180. The stack of spent discs grows, their once-sharp grains dulled to amber haze. I pause—one hand on the vacuum hose, the other hovering over the trash bin—and feel that sting of waste. Ever since I switched to an eco sandpaper lineup for shop trials, I’ve noticed the tension more acutely: I want clean finishes and predictable cut rates, but I also want less landfill, fewer microplastics, and smarter material loops. Those disks, belts, and sheets are composites of minerals, resins, and fiber backings; they don’t slot neatly into a blue bin. Tossing them feels like erasing the upstream energy embedded in alumina and binders—the mining, firing, and curing that gave them bite.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/16.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/recycling-options-for-used-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/recycling-options-for-used-abrasives-eco-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/recycling-options-for-used-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/recycling-options-for-used-abrasives-eco-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/recycling-options-for-used-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/recycling-options-for-used-abrasives-eco-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/recycling-options-for-used-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/cards/instagram/recycling-options-for-used-abrasives-eco-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/recycling-options-for-used-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/cards/instagram/recycling-options-for-used-abrasives-eco-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/recycling-options-for-used-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/cards/instagram/recycling-options-for-used-abrasives-eco-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/recycling-options-for-used-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/recycling-options-for-used-abrasives-eco-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/recycling-options-for-used-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/recycling-options-for-used-abrasives-eco-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/recycling-options-for-used-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/recycling-options-for-used-abrasives-eco-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/recycling-options-for-used-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/recycling-options-for-used-abrasives-eco-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/recycling-options-for-used-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/recycling-options-for-used-abrasives-eco-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/recycling-options-for-used-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/recycling-options-for-used-abrasives-eco-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>13</readingTime></item><item><title>Price Versus Performance Over Time</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 20 Dec 2025 14:25:50 +0000</pubDate><category>Brand &amp; Quality Comparison</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><description>A technical guide to selecting the best sandpaper brand for long-term value—cut rate, lifespan, surface quality, and workflow efficiency.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="choosing-the-best-sandpaper-brand-for-long-term-value"&gt;Choosing the best sandpaper brand for long-term value&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning, the shop is quiet except for the steady whirr of a 5-inch random-orbit sander. You watch the dust plume flatten as the extractor spools up, then feel the pad settle onto a maple panel you’ve jointed and planed true. The first passes feel crisp—rapid cut, clean scratch pattern, no chatter. Then the feedback shifts. Heat creeps in. The pad skates slightly, cutting less and loading more. You flip the disc, glance at the resin smear, and do the quick math we all do when we care about price versus performance over time: how many panels per disc, and what did it actually cost to get this surface ready for finish? This is why the question of the best sandpaper brand is never just about brand—it’s about measurable throughput, surface quality, and the total cost of consistency.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/14.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/facebook/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/facebook/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/facebook/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/instagram/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/instagram/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/instagram/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/pinterest/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/pinterest/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/pinterest/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/facebook/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/facebook/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/facebook/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Film Versus Paper Backing With Grains</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 17:25:57 +0000</pubDate><category>Abrasive Materials &amp; Compounds</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><description>Film vs paper sandpaper backings explained with grain choices like silicon carbide, plus pro tips for wet/dry sanding and flawless finishes.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="film-vs-paper-backing-with-silicon-carbide-sandpaper"&gt;Film vs Paper Backing with Silicon Carbide Sandpaper&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday mornings in the shop start the same for me: kettle on, soft sun across the bench, and a project at that satisfying almost-there stage. I’d been chasing a glass-flat finish on a walnut desk with an epoxy river, and the last pass was fighting me—tiny swirls that only showed in raking light. I’d been sanding wet to keep dust down, but the paper kept going mushy at the edges. That’s when I swapped in film-backed silicon carbide sandpaper I’d stashed for auto body work. The difference was immediate: the sheet kept its shape, water beaded and carried the swarf away, and the scratch pattern evened out in a few clean passes. The surface went quiet—no chatter, just controlled cutting.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/10.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/instagram/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/instagram/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/instagram/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Edge Control Around Hardware And Seams</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 13:38:27 +0000</pubDate><category>Marine Sanding</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-280</category><category>grit-320</category><description>Advanced boat sanding techniques for edge control around hardware and seams, from abrasives and pads to workflows that protect profiles and finish quality.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="boat-sanding-mastery-edges-hardware-seams"&gt;Boat sanding mastery: edges, hardware, seams&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dock still smells of salt and diesel when you pull the cover back at first light. The hull prints the sunrise in dull reflections, beautiful from afar but cruel up close—pigtails, flat spots, and a halo of scuffs around the stanchion bases where an impatient hand once grazed the gelcoat. Today is about restraint as much as cutting power. Boat sanding isn’t hard in principle; it’s hard because boats are a collage of edges, radii, seams, and fasteners that punish every lapse in control. A random orbital can fair a panel in minutes, then choke at a cleat, overcut a toe rail, or trench a seam if you don’t recalibrate your technique and consumables for the geometry in front of you.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/06.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding/cards/instagram/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding/cards/instagram/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding/cards/instagram/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding/cards/pinterest/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding/cards/pinterest/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding/cards/pinterest/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Reduce Polishing Time With Fine Films</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 17 Dec 2025 13:38:35 +0000</pubDate><category>Specialty Abrasives</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-1200</category><category>grit-2000</category><description>Cut polishing time with microfinishing film.

&lt;p&gt;A Sunday evening shop quiets in that special way it does when the last coat finally flashes off. The blade you’ve ground all afternoon catches a line of light on the bench—almost there, but not quite. The scratch from the coarse stage is still telegraphing through, a shallow arc that you can feel more than see. You have two choices: keep chasing it with the same field-worn abrasive, or change the game. This is where microfinishing film earns its keep. With a stable, flat backing and precisely graded minerals, you can push the finish forward predictably instead of gambling time on inconsistent paper or tired belts. That predictability is what shaves hours, not minutes, from a polishing day.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/27.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film/cards/facebook/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film/cards/facebook/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film/cards/facebook/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film/cards/instagram/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film/cards/instagram/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film/cards/instagram/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film/cards/pinterest/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film/cards/pinterest/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film/cards/pinterest/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film/cards/facebook/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film/cards/facebook/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film/cards/facebook/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>When To Drop Back A Grit To Fix Defects</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/15/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/15/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 15 Dec 2025 13:46:21 +0000</pubDate><category>Grit Range &amp; Classification</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><description>Practical rules and tests to know when to drop back sandpaper grit to remove defects without over-sanding, from wood and resin to automotive clear coat.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="when-to-drop-back-sandpaper-grit-to-fix-defects"&gt;When to Drop Back Sandpaper Grit to Fix Defects&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning. Coffee cooling on the bench, raking light cutting across your project like a truth serum. You wanted a quick scuff-and-recoat—thirty minutes, tops. Instead, the panel keeps whispering back at you: that line near the edge, the mysterious dull patch that won’t clear, the faint spiral that appears only at a certain angle. You switch sheets, then pressure, then motion, but the micro-scratches stubbornly telegraph through. It’s the universal moment where your patience meets physics: do you keep climbing up the sequence or drop back a sandpaper grit to reset the scratch pattern?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/21.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/15/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/15/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/15/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/15/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit/cards/instagram/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/15/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit/cards/instagram/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/15/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit/cards/instagram/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/15/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit/cards/pinterest/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/15/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit/cards/pinterest/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/15/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit/cards/pinterest/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/15/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/15/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/15/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Apply Dry Guide Coat Evenly Over Primer Before Blocking</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2025 13:40:28 +0000</pubDate><category>Auto Body Sanding</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-500</category><category>grit-600</category><category>dust control</category><description>Learn how to apply a dry guide coat evenly over primer and block panels with precision.

&lt;p&gt;The shop is quiet except for the hiss of air through a regulator and the faint tick of cooling metal. You’ve just laid down a uniform film of high-build primer on a long quarter panel, the kind with a subtle crown that punishes any lapse in technique. Under raking LEDs, the surface looks good—flat at a glance, gray and matte like it should. But you know better. Until you perform disciplined guide coat sanding, there’s no honest way to read the surface. The panel has its history: tap-down marks from the last round of metalwork, a skim of filler you were careful not to overshape, and a featheredge that transitions into OEM finish along the dogleg. If any area is slightly low, the topcoat will amplify it like a megaphone.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/16.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding/cards/facebook/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding/cards/facebook/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding/cards/facebook/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding/cards/instagram/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding/cards/instagram/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding/cards/instagram/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding/cards/pinterest/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding/cards/pinterest/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding/cards/pinterest/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding/cards/facebook/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding/cards/facebook/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding/cards/facebook/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>13</readingTime></item><item><title>Figure Eight Motion For Pole Sander On Walls</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/figure-eight-motion-for-pole-sander-on-walls-pole-sander-drywall/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/figure-eight-motion-for-pole-sander-on-walls-pole-sander-drywall/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 07 Dec 2025 16:34:58 +0000</pubDate><category>Drywall Sanding</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit progression</category><category>orbital sander</category><category>dust control</category><description>Master the figure‑eight motion for pole sanding drywall.

&lt;p&gt;The first time I learned the figure‑eight, it was 6 a.m., coffee in a paint-stained thermos, and a living room taped up like a crime scene. The house belonged to a neighbor who’d done an earnest DIY skim coat. The seams were proud, ridges crisp as a credit card. I’d already spent too many nights fighting walls with the wrong motion: straight up and down, back and forth, carving tracks with a pole head that liked to dig in at the end of each stroke. If you’ve ever wrestled a pole sander drywall on a long seam, you know that end-of-stroke gouge—the one that laughs at you when the primer hits it.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/12.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/figure-eight-motion-for-pole-sander-on-walls-pole-sander-drywall/cards/facebook/figure-eight-motion-for-pole-sander-on-walls-pole-sander-drywall.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/figure-eight-motion-for-pole-sander-on-walls-pole-sander-drywall/cards/facebook/figure-eight-motion-for-pole-sander-on-walls-pole-sander-drywall.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/figure-eight-motion-for-pole-sander-on-walls-pole-sander-drywall/cards/facebook/figure-eight-motion-for-pole-sander-on-walls-pole-sander-drywall.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/figure-eight-motion-for-pole-sander-on-walls-pole-sander-drywall/cards/instagram/figure-eight-motion-for-pole-sander-on-walls-pole-sander-drywall.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/figure-eight-motion-for-pole-sander-on-walls-pole-sander-drywall/cards/instagram/figure-eight-motion-for-pole-sander-on-walls-pole-sander-drywall.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/figure-eight-motion-for-pole-sander-on-walls-pole-sander-drywall/cards/instagram/figure-eight-motion-for-pole-sander-on-walls-pole-sander-drywall.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/figure-eight-motion-for-pole-sander-on-walls-pole-sander-drywall/cards/pinterest/figure-eight-motion-for-pole-sander-on-walls-pole-sander-drywall.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/figure-eight-motion-for-pole-sander-on-walls-pole-sander-drywall/cards/pinterest/figure-eight-motion-for-pole-sander-on-walls-pole-sander-drywall.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/figure-eight-motion-for-pole-sander-on-walls-pole-sander-drywall/cards/pinterest/figure-eight-motion-for-pole-sander-on-walls-pole-sander-drywall.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/figure-eight-motion-for-pole-sander-on-walls-pole-sander-drywall/cards/facebook/figure-eight-motion-for-pole-sander-on-walls-pole-sander-drywall.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/figure-eight-motion-for-pole-sander-on-walls-pole-sander-drywall/cards/facebook/figure-eight-motion-for-pole-sander-on-walls-pole-sander-drywall.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/figure-eight-motion-for-pole-sander-on-walls-pole-sander-drywall/cards/facebook/figure-eight-motion-for-pole-sander-on-walls-pole-sander-drywall.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Best Sanding Sponge Grit For Trim Surface Prep</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 07 Dec 2025 15:12:05 +0000</pubDate><category>Trim &amp; Molding Sanding</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-280</category><category>grit-320</category><category>dry sanding</category><category>sanding block</category><category>dust control</category><description>Engineer-tested guide to pick the best sponge for trim, from grit selection to technique, for flawless adhesion and smooth paint on wood and MDF.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="best-sponge-for-trim-sanding-grits-that-last"&gt;Best sponge for trim: sanding grits that last&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning light spilled across the hallway, revealing every chip and ridge along the baseboards that I’d stopped seeing months ago. The kind of small defects you only notice when you decide to fix them. I laid out the drop cloths and opened the can of trim enamel, mentally penciling in a half-day project. Then I reached for a sponge for trim instead of paper. That choice seems small, but it’s the difference between a paint job that looks good today and one that still looks good next year. As an engineer, I’ve learned that coatings fail at interfaces, not in the middle of the film. And the interface—the mechanical “tooth” you cut into the substrate—comes from your abrasives.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/10.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim/cards/facebook/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim/cards/facebook/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim/cards/facebook/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim/cards/instagram/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim/cards/instagram/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim/cards/instagram/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim/cards/pinterest/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim/cards/pinterest/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim/cards/pinterest/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim/cards/facebook/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim/cards/facebook/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim/cards/facebook/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Microscope Inspection Of Scratch Patterns</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/microscope-inspection-of-scratch-patterns-abrasive-testing/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/microscope-inspection-of-scratch-patterns-abrasive-testing/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 05 Dec 2025 14:26:01 +0000</pubDate><category>Abrasive Innovation &amp; Testing</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Learn how to inspect scratch patterns under a microscope, link them to abrasive testing, and tune your workflow for sharper finishes and reliable results.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="microscope-scratch-inspection-for-abrasive-testing"&gt;Microscope Scratch Inspection for Abrasive Testing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know the feeling: the shop is quiet, the extractor hums, and that last pass felt right. You lift the part—maybe it’s a glass coupon, a knife bevel, a sanded guitar neck, or a brushed aluminum panel—and for a second it looks flawless. Then you slide it under the microscope, roll the focus, and the story changes. The surface that looked satin-smooth at arm’s length shows a lattice of scratches, smeared streaks from a loaded belt, and the ghost of an earlier grit you didn’t fully erase. That’s where abrasive testing and disciplined microscope work pay for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/04.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/microscope-inspection-of-scratch-patterns-abrasive-testing/cards/facebook/microscope-inspection-of-scratch-patterns-abrasive-testing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/microscope-inspection-of-scratch-patterns-abrasive-testing/cards/facebook/microscope-inspection-of-scratch-patterns-abrasive-testing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/microscope-inspection-of-scratch-patterns-abrasive-testing/cards/facebook/microscope-inspection-of-scratch-patterns-abrasive-testing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/microscope-inspection-of-scratch-patterns-abrasive-testing/cards/instagram/microscope-inspection-of-scratch-patterns-abrasive-testing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/microscope-inspection-of-scratch-patterns-abrasive-testing/cards/instagram/microscope-inspection-of-scratch-patterns-abrasive-testing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/microscope-inspection-of-scratch-patterns-abrasive-testing/cards/instagram/microscope-inspection-of-scratch-patterns-abrasive-testing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/microscope-inspection-of-scratch-patterns-abrasive-testing/cards/pinterest/microscope-inspection-of-scratch-patterns-abrasive-testing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/microscope-inspection-of-scratch-patterns-abrasive-testing/cards/pinterest/microscope-inspection-of-scratch-patterns-abrasive-testing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/microscope-inspection-of-scratch-patterns-abrasive-testing/cards/pinterest/microscope-inspection-of-scratch-patterns-abrasive-testing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/microscope-inspection-of-scratch-patterns-abrasive-testing/cards/facebook/microscope-inspection-of-scratch-patterns-abrasive-testing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/microscope-inspection-of-scratch-patterns-abrasive-testing/cards/facebook/microscope-inspection-of-scratch-patterns-abrasive-testing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/microscope-inspection-of-scratch-patterns-abrasive-testing/cards/facebook/microscope-inspection-of-scratch-patterns-abrasive-testing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Wrap Sandpaper Around Dowels For Curved Edges</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 05 Dec 2025 13:37:54 +0000</pubDate><category>Hand Sanding Techniques</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Practical guide to hand sanding curved edges by wrapping sandpaper around dowels; testing abrasives, grits, and jigs for consistent radii.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="hand-sanding-curves-wrap-paper-around-dowels"&gt;Hand Sanding Curves: Wrap Paper Around Dowels&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember the first time a curve made me question my craft. It was a walnut keepsake box with a lid that looked perfect on CAD: a soft 10 mm radius running cleanly along all four edges. On the bench, though, the radius fought back. My block sander flattened the apex, my random-orbit sander skated off the edge, and every “shortcut” I tried left flats and chatter marks that showed up under finish like neon. I finally reached for the simplest tool in the shop: a hardwood dowel, a strip of abrasive, and my hands. With careful hand sanding—wrapping the paper around a dowel that matched the profile—the radius began to read as a continuous curve instead of a sequence of mistakes. The tactile feedback told me where the high spots were; the scratch pattern told me when I was pushing too hard.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/02.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding/cards/instagram/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding/cards/instagram/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding/cards/instagram/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding/cards/pinterest/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding/cards/pinterest/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding/cards/pinterest/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Open Coat Versus Closed Coat Impacts</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 13:41:49 +0000</pubDate><category>Abrasive Materials &amp; Compounds</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-1200</category><description>Open vs closed coat sanding explained with lab-tested data.

&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning in the shop is supposed to be simple: one mug of coffee, a walnut desktop to final-sand, and a couple of hours of quiet before the house wakes up. Instead, at pass number fifteen, the paper glazes over. The dust lines smear into the grain, and the sander’s pitch changes—a small but telling protest. I switch sheets, still chasing that consistent, haze-free scratch pattern. When I move to wet-sand a lacquer test panel, silicon carbide sandpaper comes out of the drawer—its black grit and smooth backing a distinct contrast to the tan aluminum oxide I’ve used on the walnut. Ten minutes later, I’m flattening a glued-up end-grain cutting board, then stepping over to clean up a steel plane body. Same sander, same operator, but suddenly my results diverge depending on one detail I often overlook: how densely the abrasive grains were packed onto the paper in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/23.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/instagram/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/instagram/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/instagram/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>When To Choose Trizact Style Abrasives</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 01 Dec 2025 13:40:34 +0000</pubDate><category>Specialty Abrasives</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Learn when to choose Trizact style abrasives vs microfinishing film.

&lt;p&gt;The shop is quiet in the way only focused work can create—overhead lights humming, a small radio whispering in the corner, and the soft, steady rasp of a belt skimming steel. You’ve shaped a kitchen knife from bar stock, or maybe you’re prepping a classic car panel after welding in a patch. The hard work is done, but the finish is still miles away from what you picture: clean, even, and confident. You swap belts, try a different disc, lighten pressure, and still those stubborn lines hang on. Do you step to a more aggressive grit? Switch to a finer one? Or change the abrasive altogether?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/11.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film/cards/instagram/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film/cards/instagram/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film/cards/instagram/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film/cards/pinterest/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film/cards/pinterest/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film/cards/pinterest/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Verify Scratch Removal Before Moving Up</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/28/verify-scratch-removal-before-moving-up-sandpaper-grit-chart/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/28/verify-scratch-removal-before-moving-up-sandpaper-grit-chart/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 28 Nov 2025 14:38:49 +0000</pubDate><category>Grit Guide &amp; Education</category><category>grit chart</category><category>abrasive standards</category><category>grit progression</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><description>How to verify scratch removal before moving up grits, using a sandpaper grit chart, lighting, and workflow controls for flawless finishes.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="sandpaper-grit-chart-verify-scratches-before-upgrading"&gt;Sandpaper Grit Chart: Verify Scratches Before Upgrading&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a quiet Saturday morning, you clamp down a panel you’ve been saving for a fresh finish—maybe a guitar body, a dresser drawer front, or a primered door skin. Coffee’s cooling. The shop is clean, the plan is set, and your stack of abrasives sits like a neatly organized ladder next to your bench. You’ve mapped your progression: P120 for shaping, P180 to refine, P220 to remove print-through, then P320 for primer surfacing. A sandpaper grit chart is within reach, annotated with your go-to sequences. The temptation is strong to move briskly through those steps. After all, each finer grit will “clean up” the last, right?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/05.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/28/verify-scratch-removal-before-moving-up-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/verify-scratch-removal-before-moving-up-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/28/verify-scratch-removal-before-moving-up-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/verify-scratch-removal-before-moving-up-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/28/verify-scratch-removal-before-moving-up-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/verify-scratch-removal-before-moving-up-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/28/verify-scratch-removal-before-moving-up-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/instagram/verify-scratch-removal-before-moving-up-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/28/verify-scratch-removal-before-moving-up-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/instagram/verify-scratch-removal-before-moving-up-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/28/verify-scratch-removal-before-moving-up-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/instagram/verify-scratch-removal-before-moving-up-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/28/verify-scratch-removal-before-moving-up-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/pinterest/verify-scratch-removal-before-moving-up-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/28/verify-scratch-removal-before-moving-up-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/pinterest/verify-scratch-removal-before-moving-up-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/28/verify-scratch-removal-before-moving-up-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/pinterest/verify-scratch-removal-before-moving-up-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/28/verify-scratch-removal-before-moving-up-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/verify-scratch-removal-before-moving-up-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/28/verify-scratch-removal-before-moving-up-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/verify-scratch-removal-before-moving-up-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/28/verify-scratch-removal-before-moving-up-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/verify-scratch-removal-before-moving-up-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Best Interface Pad For Curved Surfaces</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 18:06:15 +0000</pubDate><category>Random Orbital Sanding</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>Learn how to choose the best interface pad for curved surfaces and master random orbital sanding for cleaner contours, fewer swirls, and better control.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="best-interface-pads-for-curves-in-random-orbital-sanding"&gt;Best Interface Pads for Curves in Random Orbital Sanding&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You notice it the moment you run your hand across a curved armrest you’ve just sanded: the shape is smoother, yet somehow flatter than you hoped. The ridge that gave the piece personality has softened a little too much; the transition from convex to concave feels vague. You step back, eyes scanning for the culprit, and there it is—tiny half-moons glinting in the light. Swirl marks. Anyone who’s tried to sand a contoured chair leg, a guitar body, a carved cabinet door, or even a rounded countertop edge has felt this mix of pride and frustration. You’ve done the hard work of shaping. Now the surface needs finesse without losing its curves.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/16.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding/cards/instagram/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding/cards/instagram/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding/cards/instagram/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding/cards/pinterest/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding/cards/pinterest/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding/cards/pinterest/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Light Sanding To Improve Adhesion Between Coats</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 14:39:05 +0000</pubDate><category>Between-Coats Sanding</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>dust control</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>Engineer’s guide to between coats sanding for stronger adhesion, right grits, abrasives, and timing.

&lt;p&gt;The first coat looked flawless under the shop lights. A fresh panel of maple, sealed in gloss, catching reflections like glass. Then morning sunlight cut through the window and told the truth: a constellation of dust nibs and a few faint brush marks the light had spared me the night before. If you’ve been there, you also know the impulse—grab more finish and try to bury the flaws. That almost always backfires. The next coat telegraphs the defects and, worse, may not bond optimally. That’s where the simple ritual of between coats sanding changes everything, not as a punishment, but as an engineering control.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/12.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding/cards/instagram/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding/cards/instagram/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding/cards/instagram/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding/cards/pinterest/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding/cards/pinterest/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding/cards/pinterest/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Step Down Rules To Erase Deep Scratches</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 15 Nov 2025 16:51:30 +0000</pubDate><category>Grit Range &amp; Classification</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><description>Pro techniques for stepping down sandpaper grit to erase deep scratches on wood, metal, and plastic with precise workflows and abrasive selection.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="mastering-sandpaper-grit-for-deep-scratch-removal"&gt;Mastering sandpaper grit for deep scratch removal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first pass felt promising. Under the raking light, your tabletop—once scored by a moving box staple—looked flatter after a few steady minutes with the sander. But as you wipe the dust and the surface flashes under a shop lamp, new lines appear, marching in a tidy, parallel pattern. You didn’t make the damage worse; you simply revealed the truth. Deep scratches are not single defects; they’re profiles with depth, flanks, and torn fibers or gouged metal. Managing that geometry is why sandpaper grit selection and step-down discipline matter as much as the tool in hand.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/20.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit/cards/instagram/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit/cards/instagram/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit/cards/instagram/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit/cards/pinterest/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit/cards/pinterest/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit/cards/pinterest/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Follow Contours With Foam Interface Pads</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 15 Nov 2025 13:28:35 +0000</pubDate><category>Interface Pads &amp; Backing Pads</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>clear coat</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Engineer-tested guide to sander interface pads: foam science, thickness choices, test data, and techniques for flawless curves and edges.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="sander-interface-pad-guide-follow-contours-better"&gt;Sander interface pad guide: follow contours better&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first time I tried to refinish a vintage guitar body with tight belly cuts and arm contours, I did what most of us do: I slapped a fresh disc on my random-orbit sander and went to town. Ten minutes in, the color had evened out, but the edges told a different story—flat spots where the soft curve should have been, and a constellation of pigtails where the disc burped dust across a ridge. I stopped, frustrated. This wasn’t a flat tabletop; this was a compound curve. The tool I had was fighting the surface I wanted. That project is when a mentor handed me a simple piece of foam: a sander interface pad.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/14.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/instagram/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/instagram/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/instagram/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/pinterest/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/pinterest/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/pinterest/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Remove Psa Residue From Backing Pads</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/remove-psa-residue-from-backing-pads-psa-sanding-discs/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/remove-psa-residue-from-backing-pads-psa-sanding-discs/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 14 Nov 2025 16:14:05 +0000</pubDate><category>PSA Discs</category><category>grit-240</category><description>Learn safe, effective methods to remove PSA adhesive residue from sander backing pads without damage.

&lt;p&gt;There’s a moment every finisher dreads. The shop is quiet, the first pass on a white oak tabletop is planned, and you’re chasing a flawless, flat reflection. You peel off a used adhesive disc, reach for a fresh one, and—snap—the new disc blisters away from the pad seconds after the machine spins up. You pull the pad and run a thumb across the face. It’s not flat rubber anymore; it’s a patchwork of glazed islands and stringy adhesive, the aftermath of a too-hot removal. If you rely on psa sanding discs for flatness-critical work—whether it’s a disc grinder, DA sander, or a 20-inch platen—you know how fast one gummy pad can unravel an entire day’s finishing plan.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/12.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/remove-psa-residue-from-backing-pads-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/remove-psa-residue-from-backing-pads-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/remove-psa-residue-from-backing-pads-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/remove-psa-residue-from-backing-pads-psa-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/remove-psa-residue-from-backing-pads-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/remove-psa-residue-from-backing-pads-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/remove-psa-residue-from-backing-pads-psa-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/remove-psa-residue-from-backing-pads-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/remove-psa-residue-from-backing-pads-psa-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/remove-psa-residue-from-backing-pads-psa-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/remove-psa-residue-from-backing-pads-psa-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/remove-psa-residue-from-backing-pads-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/remove-psa-residue-from-backing-pads-psa-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/remove-psa-residue-from-backing-pads-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/remove-psa-residue-from-backing-pads-psa-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/remove-psa-residue-from-backing-pads-psa-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/remove-psa-residue-from-backing-pads-psa-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/remove-psa-residue-from-backing-pads-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/remove-psa-residue-from-backing-pads-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/remove-psa-residue-from-backing-pads-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/remove-psa-residue-from-backing-pads-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/remove-psa-residue-from-backing-pads-psa-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/remove-psa-residue-from-backing-pads-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/remove-psa-residue-from-backing-pads-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Clean Hook And Loop Pads To Extend Life</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/clean-hook-and-loop-pads-to-extend-life-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/clean-hook-and-loop-pads-to-extend-life-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 14 Nov 2025 15:26:13 +0000</pubDate><category>Hook-and-Loop Discs</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Clean hook and loop pads to extend the life of hook and loop sanding discs.

&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning in the shop: coffee on the bench, a fresh board clamped up, and the familiar hum of the random orbit sander. You press a new disc onto the pad, pull the trigger, and start your first pass—only to feel the disk skate and skip. You lift the sander and find a fuzz of dust caked onto the hooks, a few bent over, and that telltale glossy sheen that means friction has had its way with the pad. The job slows, the finish suffers, and those hook and loop sanding discs seem to be losing their grip long before the abrasive is worn out.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/10.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/clean-hook-and-loop-pads-to-extend-life-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/clean-hook-and-loop-pads-to-extend-life-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/clean-hook-and-loop-pads-to-extend-life-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/clean-hook-and-loop-pads-to-extend-life-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/clean-hook-and-loop-pads-to-extend-life-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/clean-hook-and-loop-pads-to-extend-life-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/clean-hook-and-loop-pads-to-extend-life-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/clean-hook-and-loop-pads-to-extend-life-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/clean-hook-and-loop-pads-to-extend-life-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/clean-hook-and-loop-pads-to-extend-life-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/clean-hook-and-loop-pads-to-extend-life-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/clean-hook-and-loop-pads-to-extend-life-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/clean-hook-and-loop-pads-to-extend-life-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/clean-hook-and-loop-pads-to-extend-life-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/clean-hook-and-loop-pads-to-extend-life-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/clean-hook-and-loop-pads-to-extend-life-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/clean-hook-and-loop-pads-to-extend-life-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/clean-hook-and-loop-pads-to-extend-life-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/clean-hook-and-loop-pads-to-extend-life-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/clean-hook-and-loop-pads-to-extend-life-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/clean-hook-and-loop-pads-to-extend-life-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/clean-hook-and-loop-pads-to-extend-life-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/clean-hook-and-loop-pads-to-extend-life-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/clean-hook-and-loop-pads-to-extend-life-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Avoid Burn Marks With Belt Sanders</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 14 Nov 2025 13:35:38 +0000</pubDate><category>Sanding Belts &amp; Machines</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-240</category><description>Stop burn marks with belt sanders.

&lt;p&gt;You smell it before you see it—the faint sweet, acrid note that means heat has been winning. The shop is quiet except for the belt sander’s steady hum, dust hanging in the light like early fog. You’re two boards into a Saturday batch of maple shelves, and there it is: a brown kiss on the edge, curved perfectly to match your contact drum. It’s the same mark that has sent too many good pieces to the scrap bin. You lighten your touch, bump the feed, try another pass. The scorch grows one shade darker. If you’ve stood at a belt sander—handheld, benchtop, or wide-belt—you’ve had this moment. It’s not a lack of care. It’s heat, friction, and time teaming up faster than you can move.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/08.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts/cards/instagram/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts/cards/instagram/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts/cards/instagram/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts/cards/pinterest/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts/cards/pinterest/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts/cards/pinterest/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Choose Cork Or Rubber Blocks For Even Pressure</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 16:32:32 +0000</pubDate><category>Sanding Blocks</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>sanding block</category><description>Decide between cork and rubber sanding block for even pressure.

&lt;p&gt;You feel it before you see it: the drag of abrasive across primer, the subtle chatter in your wrist, the way dust plumes differently at the edge than it does in the center. The project might be a cabinet door with raised panels, an automotive quarter panel wearing its first coat of high-build, or a mid-century tabletop with a veneer you refuse to risk. Regardless of the substrate, the instrument in your hand—a sanding block—is the difference between flat and faceted, between crisp and crowned. When the pressure is wrong, the finish is wrong. The telltale symptoms appear later: telegraphed low spots under gloss, rounded edges where a sharp reveal should live, swirl hazing that refuses to die at the next grit.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/04.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/cards/facebook/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/cards/facebook/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/cards/facebook/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/cards/instagram/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/cards/instagram/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/cards/instagram/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/cards/facebook/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/cards/facebook/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/cards/facebook/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>13</readingTime></item><item><title>Scratch Pattern Control For Metal Panels Before Primer</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2025 15:09:37 +0000</pubDate><category>Metal Polishing &amp; Rust Repair</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><description>Learn expert scratch pattern control for metal panels before primer with step-by-step sanding, tool choices, and troubleshooting from a pro workshop</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="metal-surface-sanding-scratch-control-before-primer"&gt;Metal Surface Sanding: Scratch Control Before Primer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The evening a panel is finally quiet is when the real work begins. You kill the grinder, and suddenly it’s just you, a breath of solvent in the air, and sheet metal that shows everything—every ding mapped by light, every shallow wave you swore wasn’t there in the morning. I’ve been there with a door skin laid across sawhorses, work lamp low and unforgiving, palm testing the temperature of steel that still remembers the sander. This moment decides whether primer becomes a friend that hides your sins or a megaphone that announces every missed step.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/21.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding/cards/facebook/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding/cards/facebook/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding/cards/facebook/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding/cards/instagram/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding/cards/instagram/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding/cards/instagram/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding/cards/pinterest/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding/cards/pinterest/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding/cards/pinterest/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding/cards/facebook/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding/cards/facebook/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding/cards/facebook/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Level 4 Versus Level 5 Wall Finish Explained</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/level-4-versus-level-5-wall-finish-explained-wall-finishing/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/level-4-versus-level-5-wall-finish-explained-wall-finishing/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2025 21:32:57 +0000</pubDate><category>Drywall Sanding</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-800</category><category>joint compound</category><category>clear coat</category><description>Engineer’s guide to Level 4 vs Level 5 drywall: optics, materials, costs, tests, and tips to choose the right wall finishing for paint and lighting.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="level-4-vs-level-5-wall-finishing-explained"&gt;Level 4 vs Level 5 Wall Finishing Explained&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even before the paint dries, the room tells you what you need to know. You step into a newly built living room at dusk. The pendant over the kitchen island throws a narrow cone; the western window sends a low, grazing wash across the longest wall. With the light switch up, the seams show themselves—not as obvious ridges, but as faint bands where reflectance changes with every step. The drywallers did everything “by the book.” Joints are filled, feathered, and sanded. Primer looks even. But the optics betray the truth: the wall absorbs and reflects differently where paper meets compound. That’s the moment when wall finishing becomes the difference between “good” and “finished.”&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/level-4-versus-level-5-wall-finish-explained-wall-finishing/cards/facebook/level-4-versus-level-5-wall-finish-explained-wall-finishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/level-4-versus-level-5-wall-finish-explained-wall-finishing/cards/facebook/level-4-versus-level-5-wall-finish-explained-wall-finishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/level-4-versus-level-5-wall-finish-explained-wall-finishing/cards/facebook/level-4-versus-level-5-wall-finish-explained-wall-finishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/level-4-versus-level-5-wall-finish-explained-wall-finishing/cards/instagram/level-4-versus-level-5-wall-finish-explained-wall-finishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/level-4-versus-level-5-wall-finish-explained-wall-finishing/cards/instagram/level-4-versus-level-5-wall-finish-explained-wall-finishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/level-4-versus-level-5-wall-finish-explained-wall-finishing/cards/instagram/level-4-versus-level-5-wall-finish-explained-wall-finishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/level-4-versus-level-5-wall-finish-explained-wall-finishing/cards/pinterest/level-4-versus-level-5-wall-finish-explained-wall-finishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/level-4-versus-level-5-wall-finish-explained-wall-finishing/cards/pinterest/level-4-versus-level-5-wall-finish-explained-wall-finishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/level-4-versus-level-5-wall-finish-explained-wall-finishing/cards/pinterest/level-4-versus-level-5-wall-finish-explained-wall-finishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/level-4-versus-level-5-wall-finish-explained-wall-finishing/cards/facebook/level-4-versus-level-5-wall-finish-explained-wall-finishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/level-4-versus-level-5-wall-finish-explained-wall-finishing/cards/facebook/level-4-versus-level-5-wall-finish-explained-wall-finishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/level-4-versus-level-5-wall-finish-explained-wall-finishing/cards/facebook/level-4-versus-level-5-wall-finish-explained-wall-finishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>When To Choose Ceramic Over Sic</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 08 Nov 2025 02:26:28 +0000</pubDate><category>Abrasive Materials &amp; Compounds</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><description>Learn when ceramic abrasives outperform silicon carbide sandpaper for metals, composites, and coatings, with actionable workflows and pro surface-prep tips.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="choosing-ceramic-vs-silicon-carbide-sandpaper"&gt;Choosing Ceramic vs Silicon Carbide Sandpaper&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can hear it before you see it: the sander spins up, the deck light pools across a panel, and the first passes scratch a story into the surface. On a chilly Saturday morning, I’m in a small body shop with two stacks on the cart—one ceramic-oxide disc set, one pile of silicon carbide sandpaper sheets. The job is a split personality: strip rust from a welded bracket, level high-build primer on a fender, then color-sand a fresh clear coat. The wrong abrasive wastes time and ruins finish; the right abrasive turns minutes into clean geometry and predictable gloss. And the smartest choice changes as the substrate, coating, and workflow change.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/instagram/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/instagram/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/instagram/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Task Matching By Grit Range</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/task-matching-by-grit-range-sandpaper-grit/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/task-matching-by-grit-range-sandpaper-grit/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 06 Nov 2025 16:30:50 +0000</pubDate><category>Grit Range &amp; Classification</category><category>grit-40</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-101</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><description>Learn how to match tasks to sandpaper grit for wood, metal, and paint.

&lt;p&gt;The project usually begins with confidence: a sunny Saturday, a coffee within reach, and a table or bike part you’re finally ready to refresh. You pull out the sander, grab whatever sandpaper is on top, and get to work. Ten minutes later, the surface looks worse—deep scratches in one spot, shiny untouched coatings in another, and dust everywhere. It’s a moment most DIYers and even pros have felt: the work is happening, but progress isn’t. The missing piece is rarely effort. It’s almost always selection—specifically, matching the task to the right sandpaper grit.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/task-matching-by-grit-range-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/task-matching-by-grit-range-sandpaper-grit.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/task-matching-by-grit-range-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/task-matching-by-grit-range-sandpaper-grit.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/task-matching-by-grit-range-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/task-matching-by-grit-range-sandpaper-grit.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/task-matching-by-grit-range-sandpaper-grit/cards/instagram/task-matching-by-grit-range-sandpaper-grit.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/task-matching-by-grit-range-sandpaper-grit/cards/instagram/task-matching-by-grit-range-sandpaper-grit.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/task-matching-by-grit-range-sandpaper-grit/cards/instagram/task-matching-by-grit-range-sandpaper-grit.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/task-matching-by-grit-range-sandpaper-grit/cards/pinterest/task-matching-by-grit-range-sandpaper-grit.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/task-matching-by-grit-range-sandpaper-grit/cards/pinterest/task-matching-by-grit-range-sandpaper-grit.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/task-matching-by-grit-range-sandpaper-grit/cards/pinterest/task-matching-by-grit-range-sandpaper-grit.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/task-matching-by-grit-range-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/task-matching-by-grit-range-sandpaper-grit.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/task-matching-by-grit-range-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/task-matching-by-grit-range-sandpaper-grit.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/task-matching-by-grit-range-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/task-matching-by-grit-range-sandpaper-grit.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Reduce Swirls By Pairing Pad And Grit Correctly</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/reduce-swirls-by-pairing-pad-and-grit-correctly-sander-interface-pad/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/reduce-swirls-by-pairing-pad-and-grit-correctly-sander-interface-pad/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 06 Nov 2025 13:34:29 +0000</pubDate><category>Interface Pads &amp; Backing Pads</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><description>Learn how pairing a sander interface pad with the right grits reduces swirls, improves cut control, and optimizes dust extraction for flawless finishes.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="mastering-the-sander-interface-pad-to-erase-swirls"&gt;Mastering the sander interface pad to erase swirls&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It always shows up under raking light. You sweep your flashlight across a freshly primed cabinet door or a leveled epoxy table top, and there it is—faint haloing, tight hook-shaped pigtails, and a dull gray cast that just shouldn’t be there. You did the steps. You stepped up the grits. You vacuumed between passes. But the surface still whispers “machine marks.” The moment feels familiar to anyone chasing a clean finish on wood, primer, or clear coat. The fix isn’t more pressure, more passes, or a magic abrasive. It’s control—control of contact pressure, compliance, and cut geometry. And that’s exactly what a sander interface pad delivers when paired correctly with grit and machine settings.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/reduce-swirls-by-pairing-pad-and-grit-correctly-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/reduce-swirls-by-pairing-pad-and-grit-correctly-sander-interface-pad.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/reduce-swirls-by-pairing-pad-and-grit-correctly-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/reduce-swirls-by-pairing-pad-and-grit-correctly-sander-interface-pad.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/reduce-swirls-by-pairing-pad-and-grit-correctly-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/reduce-swirls-by-pairing-pad-and-grit-correctly-sander-interface-pad.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/reduce-swirls-by-pairing-pad-and-grit-correctly-sander-interface-pad/cards/instagram/reduce-swirls-by-pairing-pad-and-grit-correctly-sander-interface-pad.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/reduce-swirls-by-pairing-pad-and-grit-correctly-sander-interface-pad/cards/instagram/reduce-swirls-by-pairing-pad-and-grit-correctly-sander-interface-pad.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/reduce-swirls-by-pairing-pad-and-grit-correctly-sander-interface-pad/cards/instagram/reduce-swirls-by-pairing-pad-and-grit-correctly-sander-interface-pad.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/reduce-swirls-by-pairing-pad-and-grit-correctly-sander-interface-pad/cards/pinterest/reduce-swirls-by-pairing-pad-and-grit-correctly-sander-interface-pad.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/reduce-swirls-by-pairing-pad-and-grit-correctly-sander-interface-pad/cards/pinterest/reduce-swirls-by-pairing-pad-and-grit-correctly-sander-interface-pad.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/reduce-swirls-by-pairing-pad-and-grit-correctly-sander-interface-pad/cards/pinterest/reduce-swirls-by-pairing-pad-and-grit-correctly-sander-interface-pad.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/reduce-swirls-by-pairing-pad-and-grit-correctly-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/reduce-swirls-by-pairing-pad-and-grit-correctly-sander-interface-pad.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/reduce-swirls-by-pairing-pad-and-grit-correctly-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/reduce-swirls-by-pairing-pad-and-grit-correctly-sander-interface-pad.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/reduce-swirls-by-pairing-pad-and-grit-correctly-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/reduce-swirls-by-pairing-pad-and-grit-correctly-sander-interface-pad.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Washable Sanding Sponges For Longer Life</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 05 Nov 2025 16:30:43 +0000</pubDate><category>Sanding Sponges</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><description>Extend abrasive life with washable sanding sponges.

&lt;p&gt;You can hear it before you feel it: that faint change in pitch as a loaded abrasive skates across the surface rather than cutting it. In a small garage shop on a drizzly Saturday, a cabinetmaker pauses mid-pass, lifting his sanding sponge to the light. The face is clogged with a pale paste—sawdust and finish residue compacted into the foam’s pores. He hasn’t even reached final grit, but the cutting action is gone and heat is creeping in. In the past, this was when he would toss the sponge and reach for a new one, the cost quietly accumulating with every project. Today, he walks to the sink, rinses the sponge under lukewarm water, massages the face with a nylon brush, and watches the slurry shed away. Thirty seconds later, the abrasive bites again, the cut is cool and even, and the workflow stays on tempo.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge/cards/instagram/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge/cards/instagram/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge/cards/instagram/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge/cards/pinterest/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge/cards/pinterest/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge/cards/pinterest/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Difference Between Da And Random Orbital Sanding</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 05 Nov 2025 13:35:28 +0000</pubDate><category>Random Orbital Sanding</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>dust control</category><category>clear coat</category><category>orbital sander</category><description>An engineer’s guide to the difference between DA and random orbital sanding, with test-based advice on speed, finish, abrasives, and setup.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="da-vs-random-orbital-sanding-an-engineers-guide"&gt;DA vs random orbital sanding: an engineer’s guide&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning in the shop, the kettle clicks off as the garage door rolls up and a slab of maple waits on the sawhorses. The winter light is unforgiving; it shows every swirl that last year’s “good enough” sanding left behind. In one hand: a well-balanced 5-inch palm sander; in the other: a heavier, gear-driven unit that can bulldoze epoxy ridges like a planer. The decision—random orbital sanding or the so-called DA—doesn’t feel philosophical. It’s practical. Do I want a fast, aggressive cut to level those glue lines, or a controlled, low-risk finish for the final passes? If you’ve ever chased phantom swirls under a bright lamp or watched edges burn through because you leaned a degree too far, you know the stakes.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/instagram/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/instagram/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/instagram/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/pinterest/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/pinterest/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/pinterest/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Scuff Sand Glossy Paint To Improve Primer Adhesion</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 05 Nov 2025 04:18:59 +0000</pubDate><category>Paint Removal &amp; Surface Prep</category><category>paint prep</category><category>rust removal</category><category>primer coat</category><category>sanding block</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>dust control</category><description>Learn how to scuff sand glossy paint for superior primer adhesion.

&lt;p&gt;There’s a moment every DIYer knows: coffee in hand, paint tray loaded, roller whispering across the wall—and then the dreaded slip. The glossy trim or cabinet door you thought you tamed suddenly sheds the new coat like a rain jacket, beading, sliding, or peeling on touch. I’ve been in that room more times than I can count, from weekend bathrooms to full commercial corridors, and the conclusion’s always the same—before color comes control. That control starts with surface preparation. Not flashy, not glamorous, but it’s the one step that makes every coat after it look better and last longer.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation/cards/facebook/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation/cards/facebook/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation/cards/facebook/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation/cards/instagram/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation/cards/instagram/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation/cards/instagram/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation/cards/pinterest/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation/cards/pinterest/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation/cards/pinterest/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation/cards/facebook/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation/cards/facebook/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation/cards/facebook/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Low Voc Binder Options For Abrasives</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 04 Nov 2025 03:24:31 +0000</pubDate><category>Eco &amp; Non-Toxic Abrasives</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-800</category><category>sanding block</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>clear coat</category><description>Low-VOC binder guide for eco sandpaper: materials, performance tradeoffs, and a step-by-step shop workflow for cleaner, pro-grade sanding.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="eco-sandpaper-low-voc-binder-options-that-work"&gt;Eco Sandpaper: Low-VOC Binder Options That Work&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know that smell the minute you crack open the shop on a warm morning—the stale bite of solvents baked into the air, the stuff that lingers in your nose long after the last pass with the sanding block. That’s the old world of abrasives talking. As a cabinetmaker turned workshop coach, I’ve logged hundreds of hours testing sheets, belts, and discs that either left my head buzzing or my surfaces butter-smooth. These days, the best of both worlds is real: low-VOC binders in eco sandpaper that can hold grit like a bulldog, resist loading, and let you breathe easier in a small shop without a giant extractor humming all day.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/cards/instagram/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/cards/instagram/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/cards/instagram/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Open Versus Closed Coat Applications</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/open-versus-closed-coat-applications-open-coat-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/open-versus-closed-coat-applications-open-coat-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 04 Nov 2025 03:03:10 +0000</pubDate><category>Backing Types &amp; Coatings</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><description>Learn when to use open vs closed coat sandpaper for cleaner cuts, faster stock removal, and flawless finishes across wood, metal, and composites.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="open-coat-sandpaper-vs-closed-coat-pro-workflows"&gt;Open Coat Sandpaper vs Closed Coat: Pro Workflows&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fresh sheet on a random-orbit sander tells you a lot in the first few seconds: the pitch of the motor settles, dust streams through the holes, and the panel under your palm either glides or grabs. On a soft pine shelf heavy with resin, the wrong abrasive loads so fast you can smell the heat within a minute. The scratch blends into a smeared sheen, then the pad starts skating—not cutting. You lift the sander and the disc is glazed with gummy dust cakes. The fix isn’t more pressure or another pass; it’s choosing the right coat density. That’s where open coat sandpaper, with intentional spacing between grains, changes the whole day’s trajectory.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/open-versus-closed-coat-applications-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/open-versus-closed-coat-applications-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/open-versus-closed-coat-applications-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/open-versus-closed-coat-applications-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/open-versus-closed-coat-applications-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/open-versus-closed-coat-applications-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/open-versus-closed-coat-applications-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/instagram/open-versus-closed-coat-applications-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/open-versus-closed-coat-applications-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/instagram/open-versus-closed-coat-applications-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/open-versus-closed-coat-applications-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/instagram/open-versus-closed-coat-applications-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/open-versus-closed-coat-applications-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/open-versus-closed-coat-applications-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/open-versus-closed-coat-applications-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/open-versus-closed-coat-applications-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/open-versus-closed-coat-applications-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/open-versus-closed-coat-applications-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/open-versus-closed-coat-applications-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/open-versus-closed-coat-applications-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/open-versus-closed-coat-applications-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/open-versus-closed-coat-applications-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/open-versus-closed-coat-applications-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/open-versus-closed-coat-applications-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Use Diamond Or Sic For Glass Edges</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 23:29:24 +0000</pubDate><category>Glass &amp; Ceramics Sanding</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-280</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1200</category><category>grit-2500</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>wet sanding</category><description>Technical guide to glass sanding for chip‑free edges using diamond or SiC abrasives, with grit sequences, coolant control, and polishing workflows.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="glass-sanding-for-clean-safe-edges-diamond-vs-sic"&gt;Glass sanding for clean, safe edges: diamond vs SiC&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The moment you lift a freshly cut pane, you feel it: the edge that looks fine from arm’s length but carries invisible threats—micro-chips, stress risers, and the slight granular drag under a fingertip that says the finish is not ready for handling. Anyone who has ever fit a glass shelf, framed a museum-grade print, or repurposed a bottle knows that the edge is where projects succeed or fail. That’s where glass sanding earns its keep. Thoughtful abrasive selection and disciplined technique turn a risky raw cut into a safe, optically clean edge that won’t shed fragments, haze, or propagate cracks under load. Whether you’re tuning a small arris for furniture-grade touch or chasing an optical polish on a laminated panel, the goal is the same: remove damage quickly, control heat, and leave a tight subsurface that won’t surprise you months later.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding/cards/instagram/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding/cards/instagram/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding/cards/instagram/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding/cards/pinterest/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding/cards/pinterest/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding/cards/pinterest/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>14</readingTime></item><item><title>Fepa Versus Cami Grit Equivalence</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/fepa-versus-cami-grit-equivalence-sandpaper-grit-chart/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/fepa-versus-cami-grit-equivalence-sandpaper-grit-chart/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 05:30:23 +0000</pubDate><category>Grit Guide &amp; Education</category><category>grit chart</category><category>abrasive standards</category><category>grit progression</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><description>Engineer’s guide to FEPA vs CAMI grit equivalence with a practical sandpaper grit chart, testing data, and clear tips for wood, metal, and auto finishes.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="fepa-vs-cami-a-practical-sandpaper-grit-chart"&gt;FEPA vs CAMI: A Practical Sandpaper Grit Chart&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It starts with a Saturday I swore would stay simple: flatten the maple tabletop, ease the edges, oil by sunset. I had a stack of sheets from two shops—some labeled P120 and P240, others just 120 and 220. When sunlight hit the tabletop at a shallow angle, I could see crosshatched scratches ghosting under the grain. I stepped through abrasives the way I always do, yet the finish looked inconsistent. I grabbed a sandpaper grit chart I’d printed months ago, the kind that tries to equate FEPA “P” grades and U.S. CAMI numbers. The numbers lined up on paper, but my surface still didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/fepa-versus-cami-grit-equivalence-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/fepa-versus-cami-grit-equivalence-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/fepa-versus-cami-grit-equivalence-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/fepa-versus-cami-grit-equivalence-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/fepa-versus-cami-grit-equivalence-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/fepa-versus-cami-grit-equivalence-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/fepa-versus-cami-grit-equivalence-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/instagram/fepa-versus-cami-grit-equivalence-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/fepa-versus-cami-grit-equivalence-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/instagram/fepa-versus-cami-grit-equivalence-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/fepa-versus-cami-grit-equivalence-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/instagram/fepa-versus-cami-grit-equivalence-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/fepa-versus-cami-grit-equivalence-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/pinterest/fepa-versus-cami-grit-equivalence-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/fepa-versus-cami-grit-equivalence-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/pinterest/fepa-versus-cami-grit-equivalence-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/fepa-versus-cami-grit-equivalence-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/pinterest/fepa-versus-cami-grit-equivalence-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/fepa-versus-cami-grit-equivalence-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/fepa-versus-cami-grit-equivalence-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/fepa-versus-cami-grit-equivalence-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/fepa-versus-cami-grit-equivalence-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/fepa-versus-cami-grit-equivalence-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/fepa-versus-cami-grit-equivalence-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>13</readingTime></item><item><title>Set Up Hepa Dust Extractors For Sanding</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/set-up-hepa-dust-extractors-for-sanding-dustless-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/set-up-hepa-dust-extractors-for-sanding-dustless-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 05:22:40 +0000</pubDate><category>Dust Extraction Systems</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>dust control</category><description>Learn how to configure HEPA dust extractors for dustless sanding, optimize airflow, and choose abrasives for superior surface prep and cleaner results.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="dustless-sanding-setup-with-hepa-dust-extractors"&gt;Dustless Sanding Setup with HEPA Dust Extractors&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a quiet Saturday morning, you roll your sanding cart to the center of the room. The cabinets are masked, the floor is taped, and the sander’s pad lies face-up like a promise. The house is occupied—kids already drawing at the kitchen table—so emitting a fine fog of particulate is not an option. This is where dustless sanding becomes more than a phrase; it’s a standard of care. Switch on the extractor; it hums to life with a steady pitch, a different sound than a shop vac—lower, tighter, purposeful. The sander’s brush skirt seals to the workpiece, and the paper’s multi-hole pattern lines up with the pad like a gasket. Your first pass is a whisper of rotation and consistent cut. No haze in the light shafts, no grit on your tongue, no need to pause when someone walks by. The job feels clean in a way that’s as much about process control as it is about comfort.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/set-up-hepa-dust-extractors-for-sanding-dustless-sanding/cards/facebook/set-up-hepa-dust-extractors-for-sanding-dustless-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/set-up-hepa-dust-extractors-for-sanding-dustless-sanding/cards/facebook/set-up-hepa-dust-extractors-for-sanding-dustless-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/set-up-hepa-dust-extractors-for-sanding-dustless-sanding/cards/facebook/set-up-hepa-dust-extractors-for-sanding-dustless-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/set-up-hepa-dust-extractors-for-sanding-dustless-sanding/cards/instagram/set-up-hepa-dust-extractors-for-sanding-dustless-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/set-up-hepa-dust-extractors-for-sanding-dustless-sanding/cards/instagram/set-up-hepa-dust-extractors-for-sanding-dustless-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/set-up-hepa-dust-extractors-for-sanding-dustless-sanding/cards/instagram/set-up-hepa-dust-extractors-for-sanding-dustless-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/set-up-hepa-dust-extractors-for-sanding-dustless-sanding/cards/pinterest/set-up-hepa-dust-extractors-for-sanding-dustless-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/set-up-hepa-dust-extractors-for-sanding-dustless-sanding/cards/pinterest/set-up-hepa-dust-extractors-for-sanding-dustless-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/set-up-hepa-dust-extractors-for-sanding-dustless-sanding/cards/pinterest/set-up-hepa-dust-extractors-for-sanding-dustless-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/set-up-hepa-dust-extractors-for-sanding-dustless-sanding/cards/facebook/set-up-hepa-dust-extractors-for-sanding-dustless-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/set-up-hepa-dust-extractors-for-sanding-dustless-sanding/cards/facebook/set-up-hepa-dust-extractors-for-sanding-dustless-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/set-up-hepa-dust-extractors-for-sanding-dustless-sanding/cards/facebook/set-up-hepa-dust-extractors-for-sanding-dustless-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>When To Use Soft Versus Firm Interface Pads</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 05:14:43 +0000</pubDate><category>Interface Pads &amp; Backing Pads</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>clear coat</category><description>Learn when to use soft vs firm sander interface pads for smoother finishes, faster leveling, and fewer defects across woodworking and auto refinishing.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="soft-vs-firm-sander-interface-pad-when-to-choose"&gt;Soft vs Firm Sander Interface Pad: When to Choose&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It starts with dust floating in the morning light and a project that matters. Maybe it’s a maple dresser you’ve promised to refinish before the baby arrives, or a fender blend on a car that’s taken you months to prep. Your sander hums to life, and the first pass feels promising—until you notice faint scratches where the grain curves, or a rounded edge where you wanted a crisp line. The tool didn’t change. The abrasive didn’t change. The difference is the cushion between them: the sander interface pad. It’s a small layer, but it decides how much pressure reaches the surface, how evenly the grit cuts, and whether the final result shows craftsmanship or compromise.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/instagram/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/instagram/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/instagram/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/pinterest/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/pinterest/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/pinterest/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Apply Psa Discs Without Air Bubbles</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/apply-psa-discs-without-air-bubbles-psa-sanding-discs/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/apply-psa-discs-without-air-bubbles-psa-sanding-discs/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 05:01:14 +0000</pubDate><category>PSA Discs</category><category>grit-240</category><description>Learn a pro’s step-by-step method to apply PSA sanding discs without bubbles.

&lt;p&gt;The first time I realized a tiny air bubble could ruin an entire finish, I was staring at a walnut tabletop under raking light. It was early Saturday, the shop still cool from the night, and my coffee hadn’t even hit lukewarm. I’d just switched from a 120-grit PSA disc to 180 to chase out swirl marks. The sander spun up, felt a little wobbly, and within 30 seconds I’d carved a faint, ghostly halo into the surface. Not a crater—just a subtle distortion that caught the light like a fingerprint. I pulled the disc back and saw it: a pea-sized bubble two inches off center. That tiny pocket of air had turned my random orbit into a tiny hammer.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/apply-psa-discs-without-air-bubbles-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/apply-psa-discs-without-air-bubbles-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/apply-psa-discs-without-air-bubbles-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/apply-psa-discs-without-air-bubbles-psa-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/apply-psa-discs-without-air-bubbles-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/apply-psa-discs-without-air-bubbles-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/apply-psa-discs-without-air-bubbles-psa-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/apply-psa-discs-without-air-bubbles-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/apply-psa-discs-without-air-bubbles-psa-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/apply-psa-discs-without-air-bubbles-psa-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/apply-psa-discs-without-air-bubbles-psa-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/apply-psa-discs-without-air-bubbles-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/apply-psa-discs-without-air-bubbles-psa-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/apply-psa-discs-without-air-bubbles-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/apply-psa-discs-without-air-bubbles-psa-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/apply-psa-discs-without-air-bubbles-psa-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/apply-psa-discs-without-air-bubbles-psa-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/apply-psa-discs-without-air-bubbles-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/apply-psa-discs-without-air-bubbles-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/apply-psa-discs-without-air-bubbles-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/apply-psa-discs-without-air-bubbles-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/apply-psa-discs-without-air-bubbles-psa-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/apply-psa-discs-without-air-bubbles-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/apply-psa-discs-without-air-bubbles-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>13</readingTime></item><item><title>Velcro Disc Attachment For Orbital Sanders</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 04:51:13 +0000</pubDate><category>Hook-and-Loop Discs</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>orbital sander</category><description>Engineer-tested guide to hook and loop sanding discs, from pad heat and disc selection to failure modes, setup tips, and performance tests.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="hook-and-loop-sanding-discs-for-orbital-sanders"&gt;Hook and Loop Sanding Discs for Orbital Sanders&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Saturday morning in the shop starts with optimism—the kind that comes with fresh coffee, a new sheet of maple, and the subtle hum of a random orbital sander spooling up. Ten minutes later, optimism hits the floor with the sanding disc. If you’ve been there, you know the feeling: the Velcro-style backing is glazed, the pad hooks are shiny and rounded over, and every new disc lasts a little shorter than the last. The culprit isn’t just cheap consumables; more often it’s heat, pressure, and a mismatch between tool, pad, and abrasive. This is where hook and loop sanding discs earn both their reputation for convenience and the blame when the system isn’t set up correctly.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>15</readingTime></item><item><title>Grit Sequence For Wood Belt Sanding</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/grit-sequence-for-wood-belt-sanding-sanding-belts/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/grit-sequence-for-wood-belt-sanding-sanding-belts/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 04:05:03 +0000</pubDate><category>Sanding Belts &amp; Machines</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Master the optimal grit sequence for wood belt sanding.

&lt;p&gt;You notice it the moment the light angles in—those faint stripes that refuse to disappear, telegraphing through the first coat of finish like ghosted fingerprints. They’re the memory of rushed prep, of skipped grits and overheated passes. Anyone who has carried a tabletop into the sun and watched it betray a thousand micro-scratches knows the sting. Precision starts long before the finish can, and the most reliable way to get there is a disciplined grit sequence paired with the right sanding belts. Whether you run a 37-inch wide-belt sander in a small shop or rely on a handheld belt sander to flatten stubborn stock, the same physics apply: remove the deepest scratches with efficiency, generate finer, uniform scratches, and stop at the highest grit that supports your finish system without burnishing the surface.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/grit-sequence-for-wood-belt-sanding-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/grit-sequence-for-wood-belt-sanding-sanding-belts.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/grit-sequence-for-wood-belt-sanding-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/grit-sequence-for-wood-belt-sanding-sanding-belts.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/grit-sequence-for-wood-belt-sanding-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/grit-sequence-for-wood-belt-sanding-sanding-belts.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/grit-sequence-for-wood-belt-sanding-sanding-belts/cards/instagram/grit-sequence-for-wood-belt-sanding-sanding-belts.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/grit-sequence-for-wood-belt-sanding-sanding-belts/cards/instagram/grit-sequence-for-wood-belt-sanding-sanding-belts.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/grit-sequence-for-wood-belt-sanding-sanding-belts/cards/instagram/grit-sequence-for-wood-belt-sanding-sanding-belts.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/grit-sequence-for-wood-belt-sanding-sanding-belts/cards/pinterest/grit-sequence-for-wood-belt-sanding-sanding-belts.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/grit-sequence-for-wood-belt-sanding-sanding-belts/cards/pinterest/grit-sequence-for-wood-belt-sanding-sanding-belts.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/grit-sequence-for-wood-belt-sanding-sanding-belts/cards/pinterest/grit-sequence-for-wood-belt-sanding-sanding-belts.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/grit-sequence-for-wood-belt-sanding-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/grit-sequence-for-wood-belt-sanding-sanding-belts.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/grit-sequence-for-wood-belt-sanding-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/grit-sequence-for-wood-belt-sanding-sanding-belts.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/grit-sequence-for-wood-belt-sanding-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/grit-sequence-for-wood-belt-sanding-sanding-belts.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>13</readingTime></item><item><title>Best Grit Sheets For Detail Sanding Tools</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/best-grit-sheets-for-detail-sanding-tools-detail-sander-sheets/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/best-grit-sheets-for-detail-sanding-tools-detail-sander-sheets/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 02:40:19 +0000</pubDate><category>Detail Sander Sheets</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>paint prep</category><description>Engineer-tested guide to detail sander sheets: grit selection, backings, dust control, and brand picks for wood, paint, and plastics.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="best-grit-detail-sander-sheets-an-engineers-guide"&gt;Best Grit Detail Sander Sheets: An Engineer’s Guide&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a moment in every restoration project when the big tools step aside and the small corners decide the result. I hit that moment last winter, hunched over a mid-century nightstand with tapered legs and a drawer pull recess shaped like a teardrop. My random orbit sander took care of the top in minutes, but the tight inside curves and the sharp transitions around the pull were a different story. I swapped to a detail sander and discovered what many DIYers learn the hard way: the tool is only as precise as the sheet you mount on it. The right detail sander sheets determine whether you get crisp edges and a uniform scratch or burnished tips and clogged grit.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/best-grit-sheets-for-detail-sanding-tools-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/best-grit-sheets-for-detail-sanding-tools-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/best-grit-sheets-for-detail-sanding-tools-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/best-grit-sheets-for-detail-sanding-tools-detail-sander-sheets.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/best-grit-sheets-for-detail-sanding-tools-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/best-grit-sheets-for-detail-sanding-tools-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/best-grit-sheets-for-detail-sanding-tools-detail-sander-sheets/cards/instagram/best-grit-sheets-for-detail-sanding-tools-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/best-grit-sheets-for-detail-sanding-tools-detail-sander-sheets/cards/instagram/best-grit-sheets-for-detail-sanding-tools-detail-sander-sheets.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/best-grit-sheets-for-detail-sanding-tools-detail-sander-sheets/cards/instagram/best-grit-sheets-for-detail-sanding-tools-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/best-grit-sheets-for-detail-sanding-tools-detail-sander-sheets/cards/pinterest/best-grit-sheets-for-detail-sanding-tools-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/best-grit-sheets-for-detail-sanding-tools-detail-sander-sheets/cards/pinterest/best-grit-sheets-for-detail-sanding-tools-detail-sander-sheets.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/best-grit-sheets-for-detail-sanding-tools-detail-sander-sheets/cards/pinterest/best-grit-sheets-for-detail-sanding-tools-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/best-grit-sheets-for-detail-sanding-tools-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/best-grit-sheets-for-detail-sanding-tools-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/best-grit-sheets-for-detail-sanding-tools-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/best-grit-sheets-for-detail-sanding-tools-detail-sander-sheets.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/best-grit-sheets-for-detail-sanding-tools-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/best-grit-sheets-for-detail-sanding-tools-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>13</readingTime></item><item><title>What Grit To Remove Peeling Paint From Wood Trim</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/what-grit-to-remove-peeling-paint-from-wood-trim-paint-removal-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/what-grit-to-remove-peeling-paint-from-wood-trim-paint-removal-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 00:03:42 +0000</pubDate><category>Paint Removal &amp; Surface Prep</category><category>paint prep</category><category>rust removal</category><category>primer coat</category><category>sanding block</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><description>Discover expert tips on paint removal sanding for wood trim.

Whether you’re a seasoned DIY enthusiast or a curious beginner, the task of removing paint from wood trim might seem daunting.

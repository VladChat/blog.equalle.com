&lt;p&gt;You run a hand across the tabletop you’ve been refinishing, and it feels… almost right. The color looks clean, and the first coat of water-based polyurethane flashes off in minutes. But when you turn your head, you see tiny scratches that weren’t there before. The surface feels slightly fuzzy, as if the grain has lifted. You wonder whether your sandpaper grit was too fine, too coarse, or used at the wrong time. You think about starting over—again—but what if the solution is simply understanding how grit choices change when your finish is water-based?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/24.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/24/grit-changes-for-water-based-finishes-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/grit-changes-for-water-based-finishes-sandpaper-grit.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/24/grit-changes-for-water-based-finishes-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/grit-changes-for-water-based-finishes-sandpaper-grit.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/24/grit-changes-for-water-based-finishes-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/grit-changes-for-water-based-finishes-sandpaper-grit.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/24/grit-changes-for-water-based-finishes-sandpaper-grit/cards/instagram/grit-changes-for-water-based-finishes-sandpaper-grit.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/24/grit-changes-for-water-based-finishes-sandpaper-grit/cards/instagram/grit-changes-for-water-based-finishes-sandpaper-grit.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/24/grit-changes-for-water-based-finishes-sandpaper-grit/cards/instagram/grit-changes-for-water-based-finishes-sandpaper-grit.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/24/grit-changes-for-water-based-finishes-sandpaper-grit/cards/pinterest/grit-changes-for-water-based-finishes-sandpaper-grit.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/24/grit-changes-for-water-based-finishes-sandpaper-grit/cards/pinterest/grit-changes-for-water-based-finishes-sandpaper-grit.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/24/grit-changes-for-water-based-finishes-sandpaper-grit/cards/pinterest/grit-changes-for-water-based-finishes-sandpaper-grit.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/24/grit-changes-for-water-based-finishes-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/grit-changes-for-water-based-finishes-sandpaper-grit.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/24/grit-changes-for-water-based-finishes-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/grit-changes-for-water-based-finishes-sandpaper-grit.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/24/grit-changes-for-water-based-finishes-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/grit-changes-for-water-based-finishes-sandpaper-grit.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>How Long To Soak Wet Dry Papers Before Lens Sanding</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/15/how-long-to-soak-wet-dry-papers-before-lens-sanding-lens-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/15/how-long-to-soak-wet-dry-papers-before-lens-sanding-lens-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 17:04:07 +0000</pubDate><category>Headlight Restoration</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>clear coat</category><category>grit progression</category><category>wet sanding</category><description>Learn precise soak times for wet-dry papers before lens sanding, plus pro tips on abrasives, lubrication, grit progression, and workflow for clear results.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="how-long-to-soak-wet-dry-paper-for-lens-sanding"&gt;How Long to Soak Wet-Dry Paper for Lens Sanding&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first time you watch dusk turn your road into a tunnel of glare, you realize how much clarity lives in the small things. Haze, pitting, and a cataract-like film build slowly on headlight lenses until the world looks permanently overexposed. You pull into the garage, set a bucket by the bumper, and stare at a stack of wet-dry papers—silicon carbide sheets curling slightly at the edges. You’ve polished paint before, maybe even cut orange peel out of clear coat, but lenses are different. They’re optically functional components. Every scratch you leave behind scatters photons that should have stayed focused on the road. This is why prep matters. And one deceptively simple choice—how long to soak wet-dry papers before lens sanding—will decide whether you cut cleanly with predictable scratch geometry or fight galling, loading, and inconsistent finish all evening.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/23.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/15/how-long-to-soak-wet-dry-papers-before-lens-sanding-lens-sanding/cards/facebook/how-long-to-soak-wet-dry-papers-before-lens-sanding-lens-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/15/how-long-to-soak-wet-dry-papers-before-lens-sanding-lens-sanding/cards/facebook/how-long-to-soak-wet-dry-papers-before-lens-sanding-lens-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/15/how-long-to-soak-wet-dry-papers-before-lens-sanding-lens-sanding/cards/facebook/how-long-to-soak-wet-dry-papers-before-lens-sanding-lens-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/15/how-long-to-soak-wet-dry-papers-before-lens-sanding-lens-sanding/cards/instagram/how-long-to-soak-wet-dry-papers-before-lens-sanding-lens-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/15/how-long-to-soak-wet-dry-papers-before-lens-sanding-lens-sanding/cards/instagram/how-long-to-soak-wet-dry-papers-before-lens-sanding-lens-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/15/how-long-to-soak-wet-dry-papers-before-lens-sanding-lens-sanding/cards/instagram/how-long-to-soak-wet-dry-papers-before-lens-sanding-lens-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/15/how-long-to-soak-wet-dry-papers-before-lens-sanding-lens-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-long-to-soak-wet-dry-papers-before-lens-sanding-lens-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/15/how-long-to-soak-wet-dry-papers-before-lens-sanding-lens-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-long-to-soak-wet-dry-papers-before-lens-sanding-lens-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/15/how-long-to-soak-wet-dry-papers-before-lens-sanding-lens-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-long-to-soak-wet-dry-papers-before-lens-sanding-lens-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/15/how-long-to-soak-wet-dry-papers-before-lens-sanding-lens-sanding/cards/facebook/how-long-to-soak-wet-dry-papers-before-lens-sanding-lens-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/15/how-long-to-soak-wet-dry-papers-before-lens-sanding-lens-sanding/cards/facebook/how-long-to-soak-wet-dry-papers-before-lens-sanding-lens-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/15/how-long-to-soak-wet-dry-papers-before-lens-sanding-lens-sanding/cards/facebook/how-long-to-soak-wet-dry-papers-before-lens-sanding-lens-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Flatten Texture Without Exposing Basecoat On High Spots</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/15/flatten-texture-without-exposing-basecoat-on-high-spots-clear-coat-leveling/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/15/flatten-texture-without-exposing-basecoat-on-high-spots-clear-coat-leveling/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 15:40:14 +0000</pubDate><category>Wet Sanding Clear Coat</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>clear coat</category><category>mirror finish</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>Learn how to flatten clear coat texture without burning through the base.

&lt;p&gt;You know the moment: the car looks incredible under garage lights, glossy and deep. But then you pull into bright midday sun and see the texture—orange peel, a few dust nibs, maybe a mild wave on a hood that deserves to be glass-smooth. Your stomach drops. You want that mirror finish, yet the fear of sanding through the high spots into basecoat is real. It’s not just about shine; it’s about preserving the integrity (and value) of the paint system. That’s where clear coat leveling comes in—methodical, careful, and entirely achievable with the right approach.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/21.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/15/flatten-texture-without-exposing-basecoat-on-high-spots-clear-coat-leveling/cards/facebook/flatten-texture-without-exposing-basecoat-on-high-spots-clear-coat-leveling.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/15/flatten-texture-without-exposing-basecoat-on-high-spots-clear-coat-leveling/cards/facebook/flatten-texture-without-exposing-basecoat-on-high-spots-clear-coat-leveling.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/15/flatten-texture-without-exposing-basecoat-on-high-spots-clear-coat-leveling/cards/facebook/flatten-texture-without-exposing-basecoat-on-high-spots-clear-coat-leveling.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/15/flatten-texture-without-exposing-basecoat-on-high-spots-clear-coat-leveling/cards/instagram/flatten-texture-without-exposing-basecoat-on-high-spots-clear-coat-leveling.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/15/flatten-texture-without-exposing-basecoat-on-high-spots-clear-coat-leveling/cards/instagram/flatten-texture-without-exposing-basecoat-on-high-spots-clear-coat-leveling.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/15/flatten-texture-without-exposing-basecoat-on-high-spots-clear-coat-leveling/cards/instagram/flatten-texture-without-exposing-basecoat-on-high-spots-clear-coat-leveling.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/15/flatten-texture-without-exposing-basecoat-on-high-spots-clear-coat-leveling/cards/pinterest/flatten-texture-without-exposing-basecoat-on-high-spots-clear-coat-leveling.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/15/flatten-texture-without-exposing-basecoat-on-high-spots-clear-coat-leveling/cards/pinterest/flatten-texture-without-exposing-basecoat-on-high-spots-clear-coat-leveling.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/15/flatten-texture-without-exposing-basecoat-on-high-spots-clear-coat-leveling/cards/pinterest/flatten-texture-without-exposing-basecoat-on-high-spots-clear-coat-leveling.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/15/flatten-texture-without-exposing-basecoat-on-high-spots-clear-coat-leveling/cards/facebook/flatten-texture-without-exposing-basecoat-on-high-spots-clear-coat-leveling.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/15/flatten-texture-without-exposing-basecoat-on-high-spots-clear-coat-leveling/cards/facebook/flatten-texture-without-exposing-basecoat-on-high-spots-clear-coat-leveling.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/15/flatten-texture-without-exposing-basecoat-on-high-spots-clear-coat-leveling/cards/facebook/flatten-texture-without-exposing-basecoat-on-high-spots-clear-coat-leveling.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Sanding Techniques For Curved And Detailed Molding</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/12/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/12/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 13:48:46 +0000</pubDate><category>Trim &amp; Molding Sanding</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>clear coat</category><category>orbital sander</category><category>sanding block</category><description>Learn expert molding sanding techniques for curved and detailed trim.

&lt;p&gt;The afternoon light hit the hallway just right—the kind of slant that makes crisp edges glow and tiny flaws stand out like little shadows. The old crown molding you’d decided to keep (and just refresh) looked less romantic up close: nicks where movers grazed it, soft ridges from past paint jobs, and a few dips where a power sander had been a touch too enthusiastic. You ran a fingertip along the ogee, felt a wave where a clean curve should be, and realized this was not a job for brute force. It was a job for patience and precision. If you’ve tried molding sanding before, you know the paradox: the more you try to fix a profile, the easier it is to flatten it.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/13.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/12/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding/cards/facebook/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/12/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding/cards/facebook/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/12/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding/cards/facebook/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/12/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding/cards/instagram/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/12/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding/cards/instagram/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/12/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding/cards/instagram/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/12/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding/cards/pinterest/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/12/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding/cards/pinterest/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/12/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding/cards/pinterest/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/12/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding/cards/facebook/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/12/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding/cards/facebook/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/12/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding/cards/facebook/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Fix Dents And White Rings Before Applying New Finish</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 15:12:04 +0000</pubDate><category>Furniture Refinishing</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>sanding block</category><category>clear coat</category><category>dust control</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Learn how to fix dents and white rings before applying a new finish.

&lt;p&gt;Saturday light hits the dining table just right, and that’s both a blessing and a curse. You can see everything: the tiny crater where a laptop corner sank into soft oak during a late-night email sprint, the ghostly white ring from a forgotten coffee mug, the faint scratch where a science project met an impatient sponge. These are the little scars of a life well-lived—until you decide it’s time to refinish. As a workshop guy who lives for clean joins, crisp edges, and silky finishes, I’ve learned that great furniture restoration lives or dies before you ever open a finish can. If you don’t fix dents and lift white rings properly, your “new finish” just spotlights old mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/11.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration/cards/facebook/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration/cards/facebook/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration/cards/facebook/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration/cards/instagram/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration/cards/instagram/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration/cards/instagram/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration/cards/pinterest/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration/cards/pinterest/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration/cards/pinterest/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration/cards/facebook/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration/cards/facebook/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration/cards/facebook/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>User Tests For Swirl Mark Reduction</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/08/user-tests-for-swirl-mark-reduction-best-sandpaper-brand/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/08/user-tests-for-swirl-mark-reduction-best-sandpaper-brand/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 13:46:39 +0000</pubDate><category>Brand &amp; Quality Comparison</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-1200</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>clear coat</category><category>mirror finish</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Engineer-tested guide to swirl mark reduction.

&lt;p&gt;The first time I noticed swirl marks, I wasn’t looking for them. A Saturday sunbreak hit my hood just right, and the paint—washed, waxed, and baby’d—looked like a galaxy of faint holograms. If you’ve had the same moment, you know how stubborn those arcs can be. As a product engineer who tests abrasives for a living, I’ve learned swirls aren’t just cosmetic annoyances; they’re microscopic signatures of process, pressure, and particle geometry. And when you’re chasing a mirror finish—whether on automotive clear coat, a guitar body, or a lacquered tabletop—the choice of abrasive is not an afterthought. Selecting the best sandpaper brand for your workflow often determines whether you finish the job in one polishing cycle or chase haze all afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/01.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/08/user-tests-for-swirl-mark-reduction-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/facebook/user-tests-for-swirl-mark-reduction-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/08/user-tests-for-swirl-mark-reduction-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/facebook/user-tests-for-swirl-mark-reduction-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/08/user-tests-for-swirl-mark-reduction-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/facebook/user-tests-for-swirl-mark-reduction-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/08/user-tests-for-swirl-mark-reduction-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/instagram/user-tests-for-swirl-mark-reduction-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/08/user-tests-for-swirl-mark-reduction-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/instagram/user-tests-for-swirl-mark-reduction-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/08/user-tests-for-swirl-mark-reduction-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/instagram/user-tests-for-swirl-mark-reduction-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/08/user-tests-for-swirl-mark-reduction-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/pinterest/user-tests-for-swirl-mark-reduction-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/08/user-tests-for-swirl-mark-reduction-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/pinterest/user-tests-for-swirl-mark-reduction-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/08/user-tests-for-swirl-mark-reduction-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/pinterest/user-tests-for-swirl-mark-reduction-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/08/user-tests-for-swirl-mark-reduction-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/facebook/user-tests-for-swirl-mark-reduction-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/08/user-tests-for-swirl-mark-reduction-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/facebook/user-tests-for-swirl-mark-reduction-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/08/user-tests-for-swirl-mark-reduction-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/facebook/user-tests-for-swirl-mark-reduction-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Waterproof Binders For Wet Sanding</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/07/waterproof-binders-for-wet-sanding-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/07/waterproof-binders-for-wet-sanding-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 14:17:23 +0000</pubDate><category>Abrasive Materials &amp; Compounds</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>dry sanding</category><category>clear coat</category><category>resin casting</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Learn how waterproof binders and silicon carbide sandpaper work together for flawless wet sanding, from materials to technique, tips, and troubleshooting.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="silicon-carbide-sandpaper-and-waterproof-binders"&gt;Silicon carbide sandpaper and waterproof binders&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a moment in every finishing project when you catch the light just right and see everything: the soft glow of a guitar body after hours of smoothing, the mirror sheen on a freshly clear-coated fender, or the glassy countertop you’ve sanded patiently between pours. Wet sanding is often the bridge to that moment—quiet, controlled, and surprisingly meditative. But if you’ve ever had a sheet turn mushy halfway through, watched abrasive grains shed from the backing, or dealt with that relentless gummy slurry, you’ve met the hidden variable many overlook: the waterproof binder.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/26.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/07/waterproof-binders-for-wet-sanding-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/waterproof-binders-for-wet-sanding-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/07/waterproof-binders-for-wet-sanding-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/waterproof-binders-for-wet-sanding-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/07/waterproof-binders-for-wet-sanding-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/waterproof-binders-for-wet-sanding-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/07/waterproof-binders-for-wet-sanding-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/instagram/waterproof-binders-for-wet-sanding-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/07/waterproof-binders-for-wet-sanding-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/instagram/waterproof-binders-for-wet-sanding-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/07/waterproof-binders-for-wet-sanding-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/instagram/waterproof-binders-for-wet-sanding-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/07/waterproof-binders-for-wet-sanding-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/waterproof-binders-for-wet-sanding-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/07/waterproof-binders-for-wet-sanding-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/waterproof-binders-for-wet-sanding-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/07/waterproof-binders-for-wet-sanding-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/waterproof-binders-for-wet-sanding-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/07/waterproof-binders-for-wet-sanding-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/waterproof-binders-for-wet-sanding-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/07/waterproof-binders-for-wet-sanding-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/waterproof-binders-for-wet-sanding-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/07/waterproof-binders-for-wet-sanding-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/waterproof-binders-for-wet-sanding-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Film Backed Ceramics For Uniform Scratch</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jan 2026 15:06:46 +0000</pubDate><category>Ceramic &amp; Premium Abrasives</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-280</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>dust control</category><category>clear coat</category><description>Learn how film-backed ceramic sanding discs deliver a uniform scratch pattern with better cut and control.

&lt;p&gt;You notice it first in the light. That telltale halo that appears when you shift the panel under a shop lamp, the swirl that refuses to quit even after another pass with the sander. Maybe it’s a cabinet door you’ve been nursing back to life, a car fender in primer that has to be perfect for color, or a guitar body on its third clear coat. You’re not chasing shine yet—you’re chasing uniformity. A clean, even scratch pattern is the quiet foundation of every flawless finish, and when it isn’t there, everything downstream becomes harder: filler prints through, paint mottles, topcoats telegraph the tiniest inconsistencies. The solution often starts earlier than we think—at the abrasive itself.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/10.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Cross Sanding Method For Leveling Panels</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 15:55:05 +0000</pubDate><category>Sanding Blocks</category><category>grit-240</category><category>sanding block</category><category>clear coat</category><category>orbital sander</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Learn the cross sanding method for leveling panels.

&lt;p&gt;The first time you chase “flat” across a panel, it sneaks up on you. Early morning, bench light low and raking, coffee cooling by the vise. You sight across a tabletop you’ve glued up—a handsome mix of maple and walnut—certain you nailed the clamps this time. But you feel it before you see it: the slightest rise where two boards meet, a shallow dish near one corner that catches the light like a ripple on a still pond. It’s not bad, but it’s enough to make a finish telegraph every imperfection. You could reach for a random orbital and it would eventually get you there, but it’s like mowing a lawn in circles. There’s a faster, more controlled way to true a surface: cross sanding with a sanding block.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/21.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block/cards/facebook/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block/cards/facebook/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block/cards/facebook/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block/cards/instagram/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block/cards/instagram/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block/cards/instagram/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block/cards/facebook/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block/cards/facebook/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block/cards/facebook/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Panel Wipe To Verify True Finish Clarity</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/29/panel-wipe-to-verify-true-finish-clarity-polishing-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/29/panel-wipe-to-verify-true-finish-clarity-polishing-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 14:42:54 +0000</pubDate><category>Polishing &amp; Finishing</category><category>mirror finish</category><category>polishing pads</category><category>grit progression</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>clear coat</category><description>Learn how to use panel wipe to verify true finish clarity, plus smart grit choices and polishing sandpaper tips for a mirror-like result.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="panel-wipe-and-polishing-sandpaper-for-true-clarity"&gt;Panel Wipe and Polishing Sandpaper for True Clarity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a quiet thrill in the moment you pull a freshly corrected car into the light. You’ve cleared your afternoon, put on a playlist that fades into the background, and laid out your towels like a chef sets knives before service. The paint catches the sun and answers back with depth—sharp reflections, color that seems a shade richer, the kind of shine that makes you stand still and just look. But then the doubts arrive. You switch to a handheld light and tilt your head. Is that a faint arc? A smudge? A ghosted swirl at the edge of a panel? It’s hard to tell whether you’ve achieved true clarity or whether polishing oils are quietly filling and masking your work.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/15.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/29/panel-wipe-to-verify-true-finish-clarity-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/panel-wipe-to-verify-true-finish-clarity-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/29/panel-wipe-to-verify-true-finish-clarity-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/panel-wipe-to-verify-true-finish-clarity-polishing-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/29/panel-wipe-to-verify-true-finish-clarity-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/panel-wipe-to-verify-true-finish-clarity-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/29/panel-wipe-to-verify-true-finish-clarity-polishing-sandpaper/cards/instagram/panel-wipe-to-verify-true-finish-clarity-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/29/panel-wipe-to-verify-true-finish-clarity-polishing-sandpaper/cards/instagram/panel-wipe-to-verify-true-finish-clarity-polishing-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/29/panel-wipe-to-verify-true-finish-clarity-polishing-sandpaper/cards/instagram/panel-wipe-to-verify-true-finish-clarity-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/29/panel-wipe-to-verify-true-finish-clarity-polishing-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/panel-wipe-to-verify-true-finish-clarity-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/29/panel-wipe-to-verify-true-finish-clarity-polishing-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/panel-wipe-to-verify-true-finish-clarity-polishing-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/29/panel-wipe-to-verify-true-finish-clarity-polishing-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/panel-wipe-to-verify-true-finish-clarity-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/29/panel-wipe-to-verify-true-finish-clarity-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/panel-wipe-to-verify-true-finish-clarity-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/29/panel-wipe-to-verify-true-finish-clarity-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/panel-wipe-to-verify-true-finish-clarity-polishing-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/29/panel-wipe-to-verify-true-finish-clarity-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/panel-wipe-to-verify-true-finish-clarity-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Avoid Cutting Through Color Coats When Sanding Between</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/29/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/29/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 13:42:54 +0000</pubDate><category>Between-Coats Sanding</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>clear coat</category><category>grit progression</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>Avoid sand-through on stained or painted projects.

&lt;p&gt;The first time I cut through a beautifully shaded guitar body, it was 11:30 p.m. in a quiet shop. The color was perfect—warm amber base, a gentle burst on the edges, and just enough depth to make the figure dance. I’d laid down two clear coats, feeling confident, and went in for a “quick scuff” before the third. Ten strokes in, the block slipped off a radius and I saw it: a pale witness line peeking through the color, a little halo of heartbreak. If you’ve ever felt that knot in your gut, you know that between coats sanding can make or break a project.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/13.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/29/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/29/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/29/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/29/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding/cards/instagram/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/29/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding/cards/instagram/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/29/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding/cards/instagram/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/29/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding/cards/pinterest/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/29/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding/cards/pinterest/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/29/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding/cards/pinterest/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/29/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/29/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/29/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Soak Time For Wet Sanding Paper Or Discs Before Use</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/26/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-paper-or-discs-before-use-wet-sanding-clear-coat/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/26/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-paper-or-discs-before-use-wet-sanding-clear-coat/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 13:38:12 +0000</pubDate><category>Wet Sanding Clear Coat</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>clear coat</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Master soak time for wet sanding paper and discs before use.

&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning in the shop, coffee steaming on the bench, the hood you painted last weekend stares back with a stubborn peel and a couple of dust nibs. There’s a bucket by your boots and a fistful of dark gray sheets curling at the corners. You know the next hour will make or break the finish—this is the moment where patience and process turn wavy reflections into a razor-straight mirror. When you’re wet sanding clear coat, the way you prepare your abrasives—specifically how long you soak them—can be the difference between an easy, controlled cut and a chewed-up mess that forces a respray. I’ve watched pros ruin perfect paint because they rushed the soak. I’ve also seen hobbyists hit glass-smooth results their first time by dialing in this one simple variable.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/05.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/26/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-paper-or-discs-before-use-wet-sanding-clear-coat/cards/facebook/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-paper-or-discs-before-use-wet-sanding-clear-coat.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/26/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-paper-or-discs-before-use-wet-sanding-clear-coat/cards/facebook/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-paper-or-discs-before-use-wet-sanding-clear-coat.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/26/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-paper-or-discs-before-use-wet-sanding-clear-coat/cards/facebook/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-paper-or-discs-before-use-wet-sanding-clear-coat.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/26/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-paper-or-discs-before-use-wet-sanding-clear-coat/cards/instagram/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-paper-or-discs-before-use-wet-sanding-clear-coat.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/26/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-paper-or-discs-before-use-wet-sanding-clear-coat/cards/instagram/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-paper-or-discs-before-use-wet-sanding-clear-coat.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/26/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-paper-or-discs-before-use-wet-sanding-clear-coat/cards/instagram/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-paper-or-discs-before-use-wet-sanding-clear-coat.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/26/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-paper-or-discs-before-use-wet-sanding-clear-coat/cards/pinterest/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-paper-or-discs-before-use-wet-sanding-clear-coat.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/26/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-paper-or-discs-before-use-wet-sanding-clear-coat/cards/pinterest/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-paper-or-discs-before-use-wet-sanding-clear-coat.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/26/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-paper-or-discs-before-use-wet-sanding-clear-coat/cards/pinterest/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-paper-or-discs-before-use-wet-sanding-clear-coat.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/26/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-paper-or-discs-before-use-wet-sanding-clear-coat/cards/facebook/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-paper-or-discs-before-use-wet-sanding-clear-coat.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/26/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-paper-or-discs-before-use-wet-sanding-clear-coat/cards/facebook/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-paper-or-discs-before-use-wet-sanding-clear-coat.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/26/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-paper-or-discs-before-use-wet-sanding-clear-coat/cards/facebook/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-paper-or-discs-before-use-wet-sanding-clear-coat.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Clean Pads To Prevent Micro Marring</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 17 Dec 2025 16:21:55 +0000</pubDate><category>Resin Polishing</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>clear coat</category><category>polishing pads</category><description>Stop swirls and haze.

&lt;p&gt;I’ve watched the same scene a hundred times: you finish a long day of shaping, sanding, and dialing in the gloss. The shop is quiet, the floor swept, your coffee cold. You swing the work light across the panel—maybe it’s a black hood, a river table, or a batch of resin bangles—and your stomach sinks. There it is: a faint gray haze of tiny trails that weren’t visible under the shop lights. That’s micro marring, and nine times out of ten it’s not your machine, polish, or even your technique—it’s what’s happening at the pad face. This is where cleaning while you work becomes the difference between “almost” and “absolutely flawless,” whether you’re finishing paint or doing resin polishing on jewelry and tabletops.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/02.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing/cards/instagram/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing/cards/instagram/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing/cards/instagram/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing/cards/pinterest/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing/cards/pinterest/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing/cards/pinterest/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Avoid Edge Burn Through While Wet Sanding</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/16/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/16/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 14:26:25 +0000</pubDate><category>Waterproof &amp; Wet/Dry Paper</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>clear coat</category><category>mirror finish</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>sanding block</category><description>Learn how to avoid edge burn-through while wet sanding using wet dry sandpaper, smart pressure control, and safe techniques around panels and body lines.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="avoid-edge-burn-through-with-wet-dry-sandpaper"&gt;Avoid Edge Burn-Through with Wet Dry Sandpaper&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday light pools across the driveway. Your project—clear coat mottled with orange peel and a few dust nibs—waits patiently. You’ve gathered your bucket, a soft block, and a stack of wet dry sandpaper sheets, promising yourself you’ll go slow and do it right this time. The first passes are almost meditative: water beads, slurry darkens, and the surface gradually evens out. Then, edging along a fender crease, your heart stutters—you feel it grab. One careless swipe, one ounce too much pressure, and suddenly the gloss gives way to dull haze. You squeegee and look closer. A whisper of primer peeks through at the ridge.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/25.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/16/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/16/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/16/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/16/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/instagram/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/16/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/instagram/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/16/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/instagram/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/16/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/16/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/16/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/16/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/16/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/16/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Best Grits For Leveling Primer</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 12 Dec 2025 14:45:24 +0000</pubDate><category>PSA Discs</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-500</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>clear coat</category><category>wet sanding</category><description>Engineer-tested guide to the best grits for leveling primer.

&lt;p&gt;Saturday mornings in my garage start with coffee, a quiet radio, and a panel that still holds a map of yesterday’s imperfections. The primer is flat gray, but under a raking light you can read it like topography—little ridges around a dent repair, faint peel from a heavy pass, and that one shallow wave you only see when you step back. I’ve learned that this is where the paint job is actually won or lost, not in the clear coat. And the tools matter: the block, the sander orbit, the mineral in the abrasive, even the adhesive that bonds the disc. When I swapped to psa sanding discs on a rigid interface for the first “leveling” cut, I noticed two things right away—straighter panels and fewer surprises after sealer.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/13.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Denibbing With Ultra Fine Sponge Abrasives</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 11 Dec 2025 14:14:40 +0000</pubDate><category>Sanding Sponges</category><category>grit-280</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>mirror finish</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>dry sanding</category><category>clear coat</category><category>dust control</category><description>Learn denibbing with ultra fine sponge abrasives.

&lt;p&gt;The shop was quiet except for the gentle hum of the dust extractor and the tick of cooling lights. I’d just laid the final coat on a black cabinet door—high-gloss lacquer, deep and mirror-like. It looked perfect under the booth lamps… until I rolled it into raking light. There they were: tiny raised specks scattered like stars—dust nibs. No drama, no panic. I’ve been here before. This is where an ultra fine sanding sponge earns its keep. It doesn’t scream for attention like a sander or a buffer; it just quietly, precisely knocks down the dots that ruin a perfect finish.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/07.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge/cards/instagram/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge/cards/instagram/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge/cards/instagram/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge/cards/pinterest/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge/cards/pinterest/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge/cards/pinterest/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Finish Out Micro Marring And Haze</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 10 Dec 2025 13:42:22 +0000</pubDate><category>Polishing &amp; Finishing</category><category>mirror finish</category><category>polishing pads</category><category>grit progression</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>clear coat</category><description>Learn how to finish out micro marring and haze using polishing sandpaper, pads, and polish.

&lt;p&gt;It’s 9 p.m., the shop lights are humming, and the panel you’ve been nursing all day looks perfect—until you hit it with a tight, cool LED beam. There it is: a faint cloudy halo that follows the light like a shadow. Micro marring. Haze. It doesn’t ruin a job, but it steals the depth that makes a finish sing. I’ve seen it a thousand times—after wet sanding runs, after cutting with a heavy compound, even after a rushed “final” pass. The good news is you can bring the gloss back. You just need the right sequence, the right pressure, and (yes) the right polishing sandpaper so every step sets up the next.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/28.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper/cards/instagram/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper/cards/instagram/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper/cards/instagram/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Tack Cloth And Vacuum Steps After Scuff Sanding</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 17:33:26 +0000</pubDate><category>Between-Coats Sanding</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>dust control</category><category>clear coat</category><description>Engineer-tested steps for between coats sanding: how to vacuum, tack, and scuff for flawless finishes without dust nibs or witness lines.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="between-coats-sanding-with-tack-cloth-and-vacuum"&gt;Between Coats Sanding with Tack Cloth and Vacuum&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first time I cared about finish quality was on a cold Saturday, kneeling on a drop cloth, cradling a cabinet door that looked perfect—until light from the window slid across it. That raking beam turned gentle amber into a topography of dust nibs, witness lines, and a faint, scratchy haze. I’d rushed the cleaning between scuff passes and relied on a single wipe with an old T‑shirt. The result was predictable in hindsight: dust trapped in clear coat, uneven adhesion, and a finish that only looked good under dim light. That afternoon I learned what every disciplined finisher knows: between coats sanding isn’t about aggression—it’s about control.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/26.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding/cards/instagram/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding/cards/instagram/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding/cards/instagram/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding/cards/pinterest/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding/cards/pinterest/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding/cards/pinterest/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Identify Hard Factory Coating Versus Simple Surface Oxidation</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 13:41:15 +0000</pubDate><category>Headlight Restoration</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>clear coat</category><description>Learn to spot hard factory coatings vs. simple oxidation on plastics, then restore safely with step-by-step sanding, polishing, and protection.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="plastic-oxidation-removal-coating-vs-surface-oxide"&gt;Plastic Oxidation Removal: Coating vs. Surface Oxide&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning in the shop, coffee ring on the bench, you wipe a thumb across a chalky ATV fender and it ghosts your finger white. Ten feet away, the headlight lens on your daily driver looks foggy and amber; a quick pass with glass cleaner does nothing. On a trailer, the kayak’s once-deep orange now reads as flat and pinkish. If you’ve been hunting for plastic oxidation removal tips, you’re halfway there—but here’s the catch: not all dull plastic is just oxidation. Sometimes you’re seeing degradation of a hard factory coating, and sometimes it’s a thin film of chalk oxidized from the base material itself. Treat them the same and you’ll either stop too early—leaving haze—or go too far—burning through a protective layer you actually needed.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/20.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation/cards/facebook/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation/cards/facebook/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation/cards/facebook/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation/cards/instagram/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation/cards/instagram/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation/cards/instagram/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation/cards/pinterest/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation/cards/pinterest/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation/cards/pinterest/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation/cards/facebook/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation/cards/facebook/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation/cards/facebook/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>When To Choose 2000 Versus 3000 Grit For Clear Refining</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/when-to-choose-2000-versus-3000-grit-for-clear-refining-2000-3000-grit-wet-sandi/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/when-to-choose-2000-versus-3000-grit-for-clear-refining-2000-3000-grit-wet-sandi/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2025 14:35:11 +0000</pubDate><category>Wet Sanding Clear Coat</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>clear coat</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>Engineer’s guide to choosing 2000 vs 3000 grit for wet sanding clear.

&lt;p&gt;On a clear autumn morning I watched a black coupe roll into our test bay, its hood shimmering in early light—beautiful from five meters, troubling at fifty centimeters. The owner had tried to fix a few nibs and orange peel with a single pass of 3000 grit, then compounded. The result was a glossy mirror with a faint gray cast in the sun and a couple of nibs still telegraphing through. I’ve seen the inverse too: a shop tech leveling clear with 2000, only to chase out deep sanding marks all afternoon because the paint had cured hard and the compound wasn’t cutting efficiently. Both scenarios point to the same decision inflection: picking the right end of the 2000–3000 grit wet sanding range for clear refining.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/18.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/when-to-choose-2000-versus-3000-grit-for-clear-refining-2000-3000-grit-wet-sandi/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-2000-versus-3000-grit-for-clear-refining-2000-3000-grit-wet-sandi.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/when-to-choose-2000-versus-3000-grit-for-clear-refining-2000-3000-grit-wet-sandi/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-2000-versus-3000-grit-for-clear-refining-2000-3000-grit-wet-sandi.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/when-to-choose-2000-versus-3000-grit-for-clear-refining-2000-3000-grit-wet-sandi/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-2000-versus-3000-grit-for-clear-refining-2000-3000-grit-wet-sandi.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/when-to-choose-2000-versus-3000-grit-for-clear-refining-2000-3000-grit-wet-sandi/cards/instagram/when-to-choose-2000-versus-3000-grit-for-clear-refining-2000-3000-grit-wet-sandi.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/when-to-choose-2000-versus-3000-grit-for-clear-refining-2000-3000-grit-wet-sandi/cards/instagram/when-to-choose-2000-versus-3000-grit-for-clear-refining-2000-3000-grit-wet-sandi.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/when-to-choose-2000-versus-3000-grit-for-clear-refining-2000-3000-grit-wet-sandi/cards/instagram/when-to-choose-2000-versus-3000-grit-for-clear-refining-2000-3000-grit-wet-sandi.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/when-to-choose-2000-versus-3000-grit-for-clear-refining-2000-3000-grit-wet-sandi/cards/pinterest/when-to-choose-2000-versus-3000-grit-for-clear-refining-2000-3000-grit-wet-sandi.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/when-to-choose-2000-versus-3000-grit-for-clear-refining-2000-3000-grit-wet-sandi/cards/pinterest/when-to-choose-2000-versus-3000-grit-for-clear-refining-2000-3000-grit-wet-sandi.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/when-to-choose-2000-versus-3000-grit-for-clear-refining-2000-3000-grit-wet-sandi/cards/pinterest/when-to-choose-2000-versus-3000-grit-for-clear-refining-2000-3000-grit-wet-sandi.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/when-to-choose-2000-versus-3000-grit-for-clear-refining-2000-3000-grit-wet-sandi/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-2000-versus-3000-grit-for-clear-refining-2000-3000-grit-wet-sandi.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/when-to-choose-2000-versus-3000-grit-for-clear-refining-2000-3000-grit-wet-sandi/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-2000-versus-3000-grit-for-clear-refining-2000-3000-grit-wet-sandi.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/when-to-choose-2000-versus-3000-grit-for-clear-refining-2000-3000-grit-wet-sandi/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-2000-versus-3000-grit-for-clear-refining-2000-3000-grit-wet-sandi.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>How To Find Hidden Cross Grain Scratches Before Finishing</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/06/how-to-find-hidden-cross-grain-scratches-before-finishing-cross-grain-scratch-re/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/06/how-to-find-hidden-cross-grain-scratches-before-finishing-cross-grain-scratch-re/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 06 Dec 2025 13:32:43 +0000</pubDate><category>Wood sanding</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit progression</category><category>clear coat</category><description>Learn how to spot hidden cross-grain scratches before finishing, with lighting, guide coats, and sanding strategies for flawless results.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="cross-grain-scratch-removal-find-flaws-before-finish"&gt;Cross-grain scratch removal: find flaws before finish&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s late in the day, and the shop is quiet enough to hear your own breath. You’ve planed, scraped, and sanded a walnut tabletop into a silky plane that reflects light like calm water. The first wipe of finish goes on and your shoulders loosen—until the sheen turns and a faint zebra pattern ghosts across the surface. There they are: those fine cross-grain scratches that seemed invisible a moment ago, now stark under the finish. We talk a lot about sanding sequences, but the real craft is knowing how to find the marks you can’t yet see—and to do it before a finish locks them in forever. That’s the heart of cross-grain scratch removal: finding and fixing the tiny, off-direction lines that explode under dye, oil, or film, and keeping them from stealing focus from the piece you worked so hard to build.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/06.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/06/how-to-find-hidden-cross-grain-scratches-before-finishing-cross-grain-scratch-re/cards/facebook/how-to-find-hidden-cross-grain-scratches-before-finishing-cross-grain-scratch-re.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/06/how-to-find-hidden-cross-grain-scratches-before-finishing-cross-grain-scratch-re/cards/facebook/how-to-find-hidden-cross-grain-scratches-before-finishing-cross-grain-scratch-re.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/06/how-to-find-hidden-cross-grain-scratches-before-finishing-cross-grain-scratch-re/cards/facebook/how-to-find-hidden-cross-grain-scratches-before-finishing-cross-grain-scratch-re.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/06/how-to-find-hidden-cross-grain-scratches-before-finishing-cross-grain-scratch-re/cards/instagram/how-to-find-hidden-cross-grain-scratches-before-finishing-cross-grain-scratch-re.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/06/how-to-find-hidden-cross-grain-scratches-before-finishing-cross-grain-scratch-re/cards/instagram/how-to-find-hidden-cross-grain-scratches-before-finishing-cross-grain-scratch-re.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/06/how-to-find-hidden-cross-grain-scratches-before-finishing-cross-grain-scratch-re/cards/instagram/how-to-find-hidden-cross-grain-scratches-before-finishing-cross-grain-scratch-re.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/06/how-to-find-hidden-cross-grain-scratches-before-finishing-cross-grain-scratch-re/cards/pinterest/how-to-find-hidden-cross-grain-scratches-before-finishing-cross-grain-scratch-re.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/06/how-to-find-hidden-cross-grain-scratches-before-finishing-cross-grain-scratch-re/cards/pinterest/how-to-find-hidden-cross-grain-scratches-before-finishing-cross-grain-scratch-re.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/06/how-to-find-hidden-cross-grain-scratches-before-finishing-cross-grain-scratch-re/cards/pinterest/how-to-find-hidden-cross-grain-scratches-before-finishing-cross-grain-scratch-re.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/06/how-to-find-hidden-cross-grain-scratches-before-finishing-cross-grain-scratch-re/cards/facebook/how-to-find-hidden-cross-grain-scratches-before-finishing-cross-grain-scratch-re.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/06/how-to-find-hidden-cross-grain-scratches-before-finishing-cross-grain-scratch-re/cards/facebook/how-to-find-hidden-cross-grain-scratches-before-finishing-cross-grain-scratch-re.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/06/how-to-find-hidden-cross-grain-scratches-before-finishing-cross-grain-scratch-re/cards/facebook/how-to-find-hidden-cross-grain-scratches-before-finishing-cross-grain-scratch-re.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Wet Sanding Sequence 1000 To 3000 Grit</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/30/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/30/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 30 Nov 2025 13:32:41 +0000</pubDate><category>Waterproof &amp; Wet/Dry Paper</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-2500</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>clear coat</category><category>dry sanding</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Learn a pro-approved wet sanding sequence from 1000 to 3000 grit using wet dry sandpaper.

&lt;p&gt;The garage is quiet except for the steady drip from a hose into a plastic pail. You’ve taped off the washer nozzles, masked the edges, and laid out your gear like a surgeon. A foam block, a spray bottle with soapy water, microfiber towels, and a neat stack of wet dry sandpaper—1000, 2000, and 3000 grit—each sheet pre-cut and soaking. If you’ve ever stared at a hood that looked great at sunset but awful under the driveway floodlight—orange peel, dust nibs, faint sanding traces from an old repair—you know the itch to fix it properly. Today’s the day you turn that itch into an even, glassy finish with a controlled wet sanding sequence from 1000 to 3000 grit.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/09.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/30/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/30/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/30/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/30/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/instagram/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/30/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/instagram/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/30/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/instagram/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/30/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/30/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/30/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/30/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/30/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/30/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Best Polishing Sequence After Wet Sanding</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-polishing-sequence-after-wet-sanding-polishing-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-polishing-sequence-after-wet-sanding-polishing-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 16:16:32 +0000</pubDate><category>Polishing &amp; Finishing</category><category>mirror finish</category><category>polishing pads</category><category>grit progression</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>clear coat</category><description>Learn the best polishing sequence after wet sanding.

&lt;p&gt;Picture this: late Saturday, lights humming in the garage, a quiet radio in the background, and the last sheet of wet/dry in your hand. The clear coat is dead-flat from your final passes, but it looks dull and grey—like all the gloss vanished. You run a finger across the panel and the surface feels flawless, almost sticky-smooth. That’s the moment when most DIYers wonder, “Now what?” The answer is a deliberate polishing sequence—and the right polishing sandpaper setup before you even plug in the machine. Whether you’re chasing a mirror finish on a freshly sprayed fender, a varnished guitar body, or a gelcoat corner on a boat hatch, what happens next determines whether you get a show-car sheen or a halo of haze.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/14.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-polishing-sequence-after-wet-sanding-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/best-polishing-sequence-after-wet-sanding-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-polishing-sequence-after-wet-sanding-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/best-polishing-sequence-after-wet-sanding-polishing-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-polishing-sequence-after-wet-sanding-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/best-polishing-sequence-after-wet-sanding-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-polishing-sequence-after-wet-sanding-polishing-sandpaper/cards/instagram/best-polishing-sequence-after-wet-sanding-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-polishing-sequence-after-wet-sanding-polishing-sandpaper/cards/instagram/best-polishing-sequence-after-wet-sanding-polishing-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-polishing-sequence-after-wet-sanding-polishing-sandpaper/cards/instagram/best-polishing-sequence-after-wet-sanding-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-polishing-sequence-after-wet-sanding-polishing-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/best-polishing-sequence-after-wet-sanding-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-polishing-sequence-after-wet-sanding-polishing-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/best-polishing-sequence-after-wet-sanding-polishing-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-polishing-sequence-after-wet-sanding-polishing-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/best-polishing-sequence-after-wet-sanding-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-polishing-sequence-after-wet-sanding-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/best-polishing-sequence-after-wet-sanding-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-polishing-sequence-after-wet-sanding-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/best-polishing-sequence-after-wet-sanding-polishing-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-polishing-sequence-after-wet-sanding-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/best-polishing-sequence-after-wet-sanding-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Why Uv Protective Clear Coat Is Required After Restoration</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 23 Nov 2025 13:28:43 +0000</pubDate><category>Headlight Restoration</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>clear coat</category><category>wet sanding</category><description>Discover why a UV clear coat is vital after restoration.

&lt;p&gt;You know that moment when the shop door rolls up, the morning light hits your freshly restored project, and you catch the reflection—crisp, glassy, and clean? Whether it’s a set of previously cloudy headlights, an oxidized hood you’ve cut and polished, or a faded motorcycle fairing you’ve brought back to life, it feels like breathing new air. I’ve been there on a Saturday morning, rag in one hand, inspection light in the other, admiring that deep clarity. It’s the quiet pride of a job well done. But here’s the tough-love truth: without a UV clear coat to seal that clarity, the sun will start undoing your work the second you roll outside.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/06.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat/cards/facebook/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat/cards/facebook/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat/cards/facebook/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat/cards/instagram/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat/cards/instagram/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat/cards/instagram/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat/cards/pinterest/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat/cards/pinterest/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat/cards/pinterest/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat/cards/facebook/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat/cards/facebook/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat/cards/facebook/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Recommended Grit Progression For Bare Wood Projects</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/recommended-grit-progression-for-bare-wood-projects-grit-progression/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/recommended-grit-progression-for-bare-wood-projects-grit-progression/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 21 Nov 2025 03:27:43 +0000</pubDate><category>Wood sanding</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit progression</category><category>clear coat</category><description>Learn the best grit progression for bare wood.

&lt;p&gt;The shop is quiet except for the low thrum of the dust collector warming up. A mug of coffee cools on the bench while you run your fingertips across a fresh board—straight from the planer, faint ridges under the grain. Last time, you started too fine and paid for it with stubborn tear-out lines that only became visible after stain. This time you want a better plan.

&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning in the garage, the air smelled faintly of cut clear coat and soapy water. A half-finished motorcycle tank sat on a foam cradle, its orange peel and dust nibs highlighted by a raking LED panel. I’d already tried a few sheets of 1500 grit from a contractor pack, but they stalled after a few passes, loading with milky slurry and leaving stray scratches that would require more polish later. This is the moment that separates a casual sand from a dependable workflow—the point where abrasive choice dictates not just speed, but consistency and finish quality. Swapping to silicon carbide sandpaper felt like a small change, but it reset the process: faster leveling, more controllable scratch patterns, and fewer surprise defects.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/09.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/instagram/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/instagram/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/instagram/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Flush Slurry To Prevent Loading</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/16/flush-slurry-to-prevent-loading-wet-dry-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/16/flush-slurry-to-prevent-loading-wet-dry-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 16 Nov 2025 15:10:09 +0000</pubDate><category>Waterproof &amp; Wet/Dry Paper</category><category>grit-280</category><category>clear coat</category><category>grit progression</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>sanding block</category><description>Learn how to flush slurry to prevent loading with wet dry sandpaper.

&lt;p&gt;The first time I noticed loading, I was hunched over a maple cutting board in a chilly garage, chasing a glass-smooth finish that never seemed to arrive. The sandpaper was supposed to be “the good stuff,” and I was stepping through the grits like a textbook. But after a few strokes, the sheet glazed over. Instead of cutting, it skated—leaving faint scorch marks and a haze of streaks. I swapped sheets, pressed harder, tried angles. Same story: the paper clogged, and the surface got warmer. That’s when the lightbulb went off. It wasn’t the grit. It wasn’t the wood. It was the slurry—swarf, resin, and water—hanging around and turning my abrasive into a slick.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/24.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/16/flush-slurry-to-prevent-loading-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/flush-slurry-to-prevent-loading-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/16/flush-slurry-to-prevent-loading-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/flush-slurry-to-prevent-loading-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/16/flush-slurry-to-prevent-loading-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/flush-slurry-to-prevent-loading-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/16/flush-slurry-to-prevent-loading-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/instagram/flush-slurry-to-prevent-loading-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/16/flush-slurry-to-prevent-loading-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/instagram/flush-slurry-to-prevent-loading-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/16/flush-slurry-to-prevent-loading-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/instagram/flush-slurry-to-prevent-loading-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/16/flush-slurry-to-prevent-loading-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/flush-slurry-to-prevent-loading-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/16/flush-slurry-to-prevent-loading-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/flush-slurry-to-prevent-loading-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/16/flush-slurry-to-prevent-loading-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/flush-slurry-to-prevent-loading-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/16/flush-slurry-to-prevent-loading-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/flush-slurry-to-prevent-loading-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/16/flush-slurry-to-prevent-loading-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/flush-slurry-to-prevent-loading-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/16/flush-slurry-to-prevent-loading-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/flush-slurry-to-prevent-loading-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Follow Contours With Foam Interface Pads</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 15 Nov 2025 13:28:35 +0000</pubDate><category>Interface Pads &amp; Backing Pads</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>clear coat</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Engineer-tested guide to sander interface pads: foam science, thickness choices, test data, and techniques for flawless curves and edges.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="sander-interface-pad-guide-follow-contours-better"&gt;Sander interface pad guide: follow contours better&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first time I tried to refinish a vintage guitar body with tight belly cuts and arm contours, I did what most of us do: I slapped a fresh disc on my random-orbit sander and went to town. Ten minutes in, the color had evened out, but the edges told a different story—flat spots where the soft curve should have been, and a constellation of pigtails where the disc burped dust across a ridge. I stopped, frustrated. This wasn’t a flat tabletop; this was a compound curve. The tool I had was fighting the surface I wanted. That project is when a mentor handed me a simple piece of foam: a sander interface pad.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/14.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/instagram/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/instagram/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/instagram/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/pinterest/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/pinterest/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/pinterest/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Select Correct Orbit Size For Performance</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/select-correct-orbit-size-for-performance-random-orbital-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/select-correct-orbit-size-for-performance-random-orbital-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 18:01:30 +0000</pubDate><category>Random Orbital Sanding</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>clear coat</category><category>orbital sander</category><description>Learn how to pick the right orbit size for random orbital sanding to boost speed, control, and surface quality, with pro tips, setups, and troubleshooting.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="random-orbital-sanding-choose-the-right-orbit-size"&gt;Random Orbital Sanding: Choose the Right Orbit Size&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s early, coffee is hot, and the workshop has that quiet hum before saws and vacs kick off. On the bench sits a maple tabletop you’ve been coaxing toward a flawless finish all week. You line up abrasives, check the vacuum hose, and reach for your sander—then pause. The sticker says 5 mm orbit, but you’ve also got a 2.5 mm model in the drawer. Which one delivers the fastest path to dead‑flat without leaving those annoying pigtails under a clear coat? This is where random orbital sanding really becomes a craft decision, not just a tool choice. Orbit size is the lever that moves your workflow. Choose it well, and you remove stock quickly, steer around swirl risks, and hit finish-quality scratch patterns faster. Choose it poorly, and you burn time, clog discs, and inherit defects you can only fix by stepping back several grits.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/29.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/select-correct-orbit-size-for-performance-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/select-correct-orbit-size-for-performance-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/select-correct-orbit-size-for-performance-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/select-correct-orbit-size-for-performance-random-orbital-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/select-correct-orbit-size-for-performance-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/select-correct-orbit-size-for-performance-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/select-correct-orbit-size-for-performance-random-orbital-sanding/cards/instagram/select-correct-orbit-size-for-performance-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/select-correct-orbit-size-for-performance-random-orbital-sanding/cards/instagram/select-correct-orbit-size-for-performance-random-orbital-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/select-correct-orbit-size-for-performance-random-orbital-sanding/cards/instagram/select-correct-orbit-size-for-performance-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/select-correct-orbit-size-for-performance-random-orbital-sanding/cards/pinterest/select-correct-orbit-size-for-performance-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/select-correct-orbit-size-for-performance-random-orbital-sanding/cards/pinterest/select-correct-orbit-size-for-performance-random-orbital-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/select-correct-orbit-size-for-performance-random-orbital-sanding/cards/pinterest/select-correct-orbit-size-for-performance-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/select-correct-orbit-size-for-performance-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/select-correct-orbit-size-for-performance-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/select-correct-orbit-size-for-performance-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/select-correct-orbit-size-for-performance-random-orbital-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/select-correct-orbit-size-for-performance-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/select-correct-orbit-size-for-performance-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Choose Wool Foam Or Microfiber Pads</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 16:03:08 +0000</pubDate><category>Polishing &amp; Finishing</category><category>mirror finish</category><category>polishing pads</category><category>grit progression</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-2500</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>clear coat</category><category>sanding block</category><description>Engineer-tested guide to choosing wool, foam, or microfiber pads—and when to pair them with polishing sandpaper—for faster, safer, glossier results.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-with-polishing-sandpaper"&gt;Wool, Foam, or Microfiber Pads with Polishing Sandpaper&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a quiet Saturday morning, you tape off the trim, load your polisher, and stare at the paint under bright LEDs. Swirls dance across the clear coat, with a few deeper scratches that refuse to disappear. You’ve got compounds lined up, pads sorted into neatly labeled bins, and sheets of polishing sandpaper ready if the defects demand leveling. Yet the question lingers: which pad material will get you there fastest, without overheating, over-thinning the clear, or leaving haze to chase?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/27.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper/cards/instagram/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper/cards/instagram/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper/cards/instagram/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Remove Dust Nibs Between Clear Coat Layers</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 14:29:42 +0000</pubDate><category>Between-Coats Sanding</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-500</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>clear coat</category><category>dust control</category><category>wet sanding</category><description>Expert guide to between coats sanding—how to remove dust nibs, choose abrasives, and perfect clear coat finishes with pro-level workflows.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="between-coats-sanding-remove-dust-nibs-in-clear-coats"&gt;between coats sanding: remove dust nibs in clear coats&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A flawless clear coat is more than gloss; it’s the tactile confidence you feel when your hand glides across a panel with zero grit or drag. If you’ve ever stepped back from a gorgeous piece—be it a walnut tabletop, a painted cabinet door, or a guitar body—only to see and feel the specks of dust that settled into the finish, you know the sting. Those tiny dust nibs are an inevitable reality of shop air, static, and curing dynamics. Fortunately, they’re also manageable with disciplined surface prep, controlled technique, and smart abrasive choices. That’s the core of between coats sanding: deliberate, minimal-material removal focused on de-nibbing without compromising film build or clarity.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/25.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding/cards/instagram/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding/cards/instagram/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding/cards/instagram/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding/cards/pinterest/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding/cards/pinterest/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding/cards/pinterest/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Compound Versus Polish To Remove 2000 Grit Sanding Marks</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-to-remove-2000-grit-sanding-marks-plastic-headlight-polis/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-to-remove-2000-grit-sanding-marks-plastic-headlight-polis/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2025 13:37:28 +0000</pubDate><category>Headlight Restoration</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>clear coat</category><description>Engineer’s guide to plastic headlight polishing: compound or polish to remove 2000 grit sanding marks?

&lt;p&gt;The sun wasn’t up yet, but the garage light threw a harsh circle over the hood of a ten-year-old hatchback. I’d taped plastic sheeting around the fenders the night before, masked the trim, and laid out abrasives like a surgeon prepping instruments—400, 600, 2000. Anyone who’s driven at night behind hazed lenses knows that dim, anxious feeling—like the road keeps secrets from you. This morning was about clarity, not just looks. It was about performance. And if you’ve ever tried plastic headlight polishing after sanding to 2000 grit and still seen a spiderweb of marks in the reflection, you know the question lurking at the bottom of the bottle: compound or polish? Both promise clarity. Both spin a story of micro-abrasives and gloss. But which one actually erases the last of those 2000 grit tracks in polycarbonate, and which only glides over them?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/19.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-to-remove-2000-grit-sanding-marks-plastic-headlight-polis/cards/facebook/compound-versus-polish-to-remove-2000-grit-sanding-marks-plastic-headlight-polis.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-to-remove-2000-grit-sanding-marks-plastic-headlight-polis/cards/facebook/compound-versus-polish-to-remove-2000-grit-sanding-marks-plastic-headlight-polis.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-to-remove-2000-grit-sanding-marks-plastic-headlight-polis/cards/facebook/compound-versus-polish-to-remove-2000-grit-sanding-marks-plastic-headlight-polis.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-to-remove-2000-grit-sanding-marks-plastic-headlight-polis/cards/instagram/compound-versus-polish-to-remove-2000-grit-sanding-marks-plastic-headlight-polis.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-to-remove-2000-grit-sanding-marks-plastic-headlight-polis/cards/instagram/compound-versus-polish-to-remove-2000-grit-sanding-marks-plastic-headlight-polis.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-to-remove-2000-grit-sanding-marks-plastic-headlight-polis/cards/instagram/compound-versus-polish-to-remove-2000-grit-sanding-marks-plastic-headlight-polis.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-to-remove-2000-grit-sanding-marks-plastic-headlight-polis/cards/pinterest/compound-versus-polish-to-remove-2000-grit-sanding-marks-plastic-headlight-polis.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-to-remove-2000-grit-sanding-marks-plastic-headlight-polis/cards/pinterest/compound-versus-polish-to-remove-2000-grit-sanding-marks-plastic-headlight-polis.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-to-remove-2000-grit-sanding-marks-plastic-headlight-polis/cards/pinterest/compound-versus-polish-to-remove-2000-grit-sanding-marks-plastic-headlight-polis.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-to-remove-2000-grit-sanding-marks-plastic-headlight-polis/cards/facebook/compound-versus-polish-to-remove-2000-grit-sanding-marks-plastic-headlight-polis.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-to-remove-2000-grit-sanding-marks-plastic-headlight-polis/cards/facebook/compound-versus-polish-to-remove-2000-grit-sanding-marks-plastic-headlight-polis.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-to-remove-2000-grit-sanding-marks-plastic-headlight-polis/cards/facebook/compound-versus-polish-to-remove-2000-grit-sanding-marks-plastic-headlight-polis.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Compound Versus Polish Differences For Clear Coat Finishing</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2025 05:56:37 +0000</pubDate><category>Wet Sanding Clear Coat</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-2500</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>clear coat</category><category>wet sanding</category><description>Understand compound vs polish for clear coat finishing with sanding workflows, abrasive selection, and process control for defect-free paint polishing.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="paint-polishing-compound-vs-polish-for-clear-coat"&gt;Paint polishing: compound vs polish for clear coat&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Saturday morning sun can be the most unforgiving inspector you’ll ever meet. You back the car out after a late-night respray—coffee in hand, optimism high—and the light slices across the hood like a straightedge. Orange peel you knew about, sure. But then the swirls appear, whisper-fine arcs barely visible at dusk now glaring at full volume. You feel them before you see them: the drag of a microfiber catching on texture, the way your eyes follow a ghosty hologram around a curved fender. This is the moment when “wash and wax” ends and craft begins—where surface preparation, abrasive control, and paint polishing decide whether you get a mirror or a mirage.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/17.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing/cards/facebook/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing/cards/facebook/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing/cards/facebook/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing/cards/instagram/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing/cards/instagram/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing/cards/instagram/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing/cards/pinterest/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing/cards/pinterest/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing/cards/pinterest/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing/cards/facebook/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing/cards/facebook/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing/cards/facebook/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Level 4 Versus Level 5 Wall Finish Explained</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/level-4-versus-level-5-wall-finish-explained-wall-finishing/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/level-4-versus-level-5-wall-finish-explained-wall-finishing/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2025 21:32:57 +0000</pubDate><category>Drywall Sanding</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-800</category><category>joint compound</category><category>clear coat</category><description>Engineer’s guide to Level 4 vs Level 5 drywall: optics, materials, costs, tests, and tips to choose the right wall finishing for paint and lighting.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="level-4-vs-level-5-wall-finishing-explained"&gt;Level 4 vs Level 5 Wall Finishing Explained&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even before the paint dries, the room tells you what you need to know. You step into a newly built living room at dusk. The pendant over the kitchen island throws a narrow cone; the western window sends a low, grazing wash across the longest wall. With the light switch up, the seams show themselves—not as obvious ridges, but as faint bands where reflectance changes with every step. The drywallers did everything “by the book.” Joints are filled, feathered, and sanded. Primer looks even. But the optics betray the truth: the wall absorbs and reflects differently where paper meets compound. That’s the moment when wall finishing becomes the difference between “good” and “finished.”&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/level-4-versus-level-5-wall-finish-explained-wall-finishing/cards/facebook/level-4-versus-level-5-wall-finish-explained-wall-finishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/level-4-versus-level-5-wall-finish-explained-wall-finishing/cards/facebook/level-4-versus-level-5-wall-finish-explained-wall-finishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/level-4-versus-level-5-wall-finish-explained-wall-finishing/cards/facebook/level-4-versus-level-5-wall-finish-explained-wall-finishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/level-4-versus-level-5-wall-finish-explained-wall-finishing/cards/instagram/level-4-versus-level-5-wall-finish-explained-wall-finishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/level-4-versus-level-5-wall-finish-explained-wall-finishing/cards/instagram/level-4-versus-level-5-wall-finish-explained-wall-finishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/level-4-versus-level-5-wall-finish-explained-wall-finishing/cards/instagram/level-4-versus-level-5-wall-finish-explained-wall-finishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/level-4-versus-level-5-wall-finish-explained-wall-finishing/cards/pinterest/level-4-versus-level-5-wall-finish-explained-wall-finishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/level-4-versus-level-5-wall-finish-explained-wall-finishing/cards/pinterest/level-4-versus-level-5-wall-finish-explained-wall-finishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/level-4-versus-level-5-wall-finish-explained-wall-finishing/cards/pinterest/level-4-versus-level-5-wall-finish-explained-wall-finishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/level-4-versus-level-5-wall-finish-explained-wall-finishing/cards/facebook/level-4-versus-level-5-wall-finish-explained-wall-finishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/level-4-versus-level-5-wall-finish-explained-wall-finishing/cards/facebook/level-4-versus-level-5-wall-finish-explained-wall-finishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/level-4-versus-level-5-wall-finish-explained-wall-finishing/cards/facebook/level-4-versus-level-5-wall-finish-explained-wall-finishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Consistency Of Scratch Pattern By Brand</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/consistency-of-scratch-pattern-by-brand-best-sandpaper-brand/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/consistency-of-scratch-pattern-by-brand-best-sandpaper-brand/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 08 Nov 2025 16:24:24 +0000</pubDate><category>Brand &amp; Quality Comparison</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-400</category><category>clear coat</category><category>dust control</category><description>Get uniform finishes.

&lt;p&gt;Saturday mornings in the shop have a rhythm: kettle on, dust extractor humming, the first pass of the sander checking if the week’s idea holds water. I still remember one particular maple tabletop that had me pacing. It looked flat, felt flat, yet stain kept telegraphing faint halos and random cat-scratch lines. I’d done everything “right,” but the finish wouldn’t sing. That’s when a friend dropped by and asked a deceptively simple question: “Do you trust the scratch pattern your paper leaves?” Since then, I’ve made a small obsession of it—because picking the best sandpaper brand isn’t just about how fast it cuts; it’s about how consistently it scratches, grit after grit, sheet after sheet.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/consistency-of-scratch-pattern-by-brand-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/facebook/consistency-of-scratch-pattern-by-brand-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/consistency-of-scratch-pattern-by-brand-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/facebook/consistency-of-scratch-pattern-by-brand-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/consistency-of-scratch-pattern-by-brand-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/facebook/consistency-of-scratch-pattern-by-brand-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/consistency-of-scratch-pattern-by-brand-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/instagram/consistency-of-scratch-pattern-by-brand-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/consistency-of-scratch-pattern-by-brand-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/instagram/consistency-of-scratch-pattern-by-brand-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/consistency-of-scratch-pattern-by-brand-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/instagram/consistency-of-scratch-pattern-by-brand-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/consistency-of-scratch-pattern-by-brand-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/pinterest/consistency-of-scratch-pattern-by-brand-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/consistency-of-scratch-pattern-by-brand-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/pinterest/consistency-of-scratch-pattern-by-brand-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/consistency-of-scratch-pattern-by-brand-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/pinterest/consistency-of-scratch-pattern-by-brand-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/consistency-of-scratch-pattern-by-brand-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/facebook/consistency-of-scratch-pattern-by-brand-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/consistency-of-scratch-pattern-by-brand-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/facebook/consistency-of-scratch-pattern-by-brand-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/consistency-of-scratch-pattern-by-brand-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/facebook/consistency-of-scratch-pattern-by-brand-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Film Backed Sheets For Uniform Scratch</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/film-backed-sheets-for-uniform-scratch-microfinishing-film/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/film-backed-sheets-for-uniform-scratch-microfinishing-film/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 07 Nov 2025 15:23:44 +0000</pubDate><category>Specialty Abrasives</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>clear coat</category><description>Learn how film-backed microfinishing film sheets deliver uniform scratch patterns with step-by-step techniques, grit selection, and pro tips for flawless</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="microfinishing-film-uniform-scratch-every-time"&gt;Microfinishing Film: Uniform Scratch Every Time&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s late, the shop lights are a soft hum, and you’re chasing a finish that doesn’t lie—flat, even, and honest under any light. I know that moment well: when a part looks good to the naked eye, but under a raking beam the scratch pattern flares in swirls and hot spots. That’s where film backed sheets earn their keep. With microfinishing film, you don’t rely on luck; you rely on controlled, repeatable abrasion that leaves a uniform scratch from corner to corner. It’s the difference between “good enough” and “go ahead, mic it—twice.”&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/film-backed-sheets-for-uniform-scratch-microfinishing-film/cards/facebook/film-backed-sheets-for-uniform-scratch-microfinishing-film.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/film-backed-sheets-for-uniform-scratch-microfinishing-film/cards/facebook/film-backed-sheets-for-uniform-scratch-microfinishing-film.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/film-backed-sheets-for-uniform-scratch-microfinishing-film/cards/facebook/film-backed-sheets-for-uniform-scratch-microfinishing-film.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/film-backed-sheets-for-uniform-scratch-microfinishing-film/cards/instagram/film-backed-sheets-for-uniform-scratch-microfinishing-film.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/film-backed-sheets-for-uniform-scratch-microfinishing-film/cards/instagram/film-backed-sheets-for-uniform-scratch-microfinishing-film.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/film-backed-sheets-for-uniform-scratch-microfinishing-film/cards/instagram/film-backed-sheets-for-uniform-scratch-microfinishing-film.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/film-backed-sheets-for-uniform-scratch-microfinishing-film/cards/pinterest/film-backed-sheets-for-uniform-scratch-microfinishing-film.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/film-backed-sheets-for-uniform-scratch-microfinishing-film/cards/pinterest/film-backed-sheets-for-uniform-scratch-microfinishing-film.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/film-backed-sheets-for-uniform-scratch-microfinishing-film/cards/pinterest/film-backed-sheets-for-uniform-scratch-microfinishing-film.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/film-backed-sheets-for-uniform-scratch-microfinishing-film/cards/facebook/film-backed-sheets-for-uniform-scratch-microfinishing-film.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/film-backed-sheets-for-uniform-scratch-microfinishing-film/cards/facebook/film-backed-sheets-for-uniform-scratch-microfinishing-film.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/film-backed-sheets-for-uniform-scratch-microfinishing-film/cards/facebook/film-backed-sheets-for-uniform-scratch-microfinishing-film.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>How To Choose A Starting Grit</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/how-to-choose-a-starting-grit-sandpaper-grit-chart/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/how-to-choose-a-starting-grit-sandpaper-grit-chart/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 06 Nov 2025 15:25:52 +0000</pubDate><category>Grit Guide &amp; Education</category><category>grit chart</category><category>abrasive standards</category><category>grit progression</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-101</category><category>grit-120</category><category>clear coat</category><category>orbital sander</category><description>Learn how to choose your starting grit with a clear sandpaper grit chart, shop-tested sequences, and pro tips for clean, fast, and flat sanding.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="sandpaper-grit-chart-choose-the-right-starting-grit"&gt;Sandpaper Grit Chart: Choose the Right Starting Grit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first time I watched a flawless finish come alive, it happened in the last ten minutes of a long Saturday in the shop. Cold radio in the background, dust collector humming, I wiped a splash of mineral spirits across a dining tabletop and the grain popped like a film reveal. That moment didn’t come from luck—it came from choosing the right starting grit. I keep a small sandpaper grit chart taped to my cabinet door, not because I can’t memorize grits, but because the surface in front of you changes the rules. A hundred-year-old oak stained dark is not the same as new maple fresh off the planer. Paint sprayed last month is not like six coats of hand-brushed oil from the 90s. The trick is reading the job, then picking the grit that does the heavy lifting without making more work.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/how-to-choose-a-starting-grit-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/how-to-choose-a-starting-grit-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/how-to-choose-a-starting-grit-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/how-to-choose-a-starting-grit-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/how-to-choose-a-starting-grit-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/how-to-choose-a-starting-grit-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/how-to-choose-a-starting-grit-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/instagram/how-to-choose-a-starting-grit-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/how-to-choose-a-starting-grit-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/instagram/how-to-choose-a-starting-grit-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/how-to-choose-a-starting-grit-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/instagram/how-to-choose-a-starting-grit-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/how-to-choose-a-starting-grit-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/pinterest/how-to-choose-a-starting-grit-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/how-to-choose-a-starting-grit-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/pinterest/how-to-choose-a-starting-grit-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/how-to-choose-a-starting-grit-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/pinterest/how-to-choose-a-starting-grit-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/how-to-choose-a-starting-grit-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/how-to-choose-a-starting-grit-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/how-to-choose-a-starting-grit-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/how-to-choose-a-starting-grit-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/how-to-choose-a-starting-grit-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/how-to-choose-a-starting-grit-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Difference Between Da And Random Orbital Sanding</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 05 Nov 2025 13:35:28 +0000</pubDate><category>Random Orbital Sanding</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>dust control</category><category>clear coat</category><category>orbital sander</category><description>An engineer’s guide to the difference between DA and random orbital sanding, with test-based advice on speed, finish, abrasives, and setup.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="da-vs-random-orbital-sanding-an-engineers-guide"&gt;DA vs random orbital sanding: an engineer’s guide&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning in the shop, the kettle clicks off as the garage door rolls up and a slab of maple waits on the sawhorses. The winter light is unforgiving; it shows every swirl that last year’s “good enough” sanding left behind. In one hand: a well-balanced 5-inch palm sander; in the other: a heavier, gear-driven unit that can bulldoze epoxy ridges like a planer. The decision—random orbital sanding or the so-called DA—doesn’t feel philosophical. It’s practical. Do I want a fast, aggressive cut to level those glue lines, or a controlled, low-risk finish for the final passes? If you’ve ever chased phantom swirls under a bright lamp or watched edges burn through because you leaned a degree too far, you know the stakes.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/instagram/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/instagram/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/instagram/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/pinterest/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/pinterest/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/pinterest/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Best Grit For Sanding Between Coats Of Polyurethane</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 05 Nov 2025 04:59:16 +0000</pubDate><category>Between-Coats Sanding</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>dry sanding</category><category>clear coat</category><category>sanding block</category><description>Learn the best grit for sanding between coats of polyurethane, when to sand, and how to get a flawless, dust-free finish with pro-tested techniques.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="between-coats-sanding-best-grit-for-polyurethane"&gt;Between Coats Sanding: Best Grit for Polyurethane&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first time you run your hand across a newly finished table and feel the faint drag of tiny dust nibs, you understand why the small steps matter. Maybe it’s a maple dining top you’ve been nursing through long evenings, or a simple pine shelf that somehow carries outsized meaning. You’ve brushed on a smooth coat, waited patiently, and yet—under a raking light—tiny specks wink back at you like a constellation you didn’t intend to draw. That’s the moment when many projects turn from “good enough” to “I want this perfect.” And the bridge to perfect is almost always between coats sanding.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding/cards/instagram/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding/cards/instagram/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding/cards/instagram/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding/cards/pinterest/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding/cards/pinterest/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding/cards/pinterest/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Crosshatch Sanding Pattern For Even Clear Coat Leveling</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 05 Nov 2025 00:59:26 +0000</pubDate><category>Wet Sanding Clear Coat</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-2500</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>clear coat</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>sanding block</category><description>Learn the crosshatch sanding pattern for even clear coat leveling—tools, grits, steps, and pro tips for a flat, glossy, mirror-like finish.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="crosshatch-sanding-for-clear-coat-leveling"&gt;Crosshatch Sanding for Clear Coat Leveling&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You notice it first when the sun dips behind a cloud. Your car—or maybe that guitar body you’ve been refinishing—looked perfect in full daylight. But now a soft, diffused glow reveals a faint orange peel, a sprinkling of swirls, and the slightest rippling along a contour line. It’s not ruined, but it’s not the glassy surface you had in mind. The promise of a flawless finish is what pulls many of us into the workshop on a Saturday morning, and it’s what makes techniques like clear coat leveling feel less like a chore and more like craftsmanship. What you need isn’t more product or a heavier hand; it’s a repeatable way to flatten texture without taking unnecessary risks.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling/cards/facebook/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling/cards/facebook/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling/cards/facebook/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling/cards/instagram/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling/cards/instagram/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling/cards/instagram/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling/cards/pinterest/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling/cards/pinterest/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling/cards/pinterest/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling/cards/facebook/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling/cards/facebook/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling/cards/facebook/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Low Voc Binder Options For Abrasives</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 04 Nov 2025 03:24:31 +0000</pubDate><category>Eco &amp; Non-Toxic Abrasives</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-800</category><category>sanding block</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>clear coat</category><description>Low-VOC binder guide for eco sandpaper: materials, performance tradeoffs, and a step-by-step shop workflow for cleaner, pro-grade sanding.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="eco-sandpaper-low-voc-binder-options-that-work"&gt;Eco Sandpaper: Low-VOC Binder Options That Work&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know that smell the minute you crack open the shop on a warm morning—the stale bite of solvents baked into the air, the stuff that lingers in your nose long after the last pass with the sanding block. That’s the old world of abrasives talking. As a cabinetmaker turned workshop coach, I’ve logged hundreds of hours testing sheets, belts, and discs that either left my head buzzing or my surfaces butter-smooth. These days, the best of both worlds is real: low-VOC binders in eco sandpaper that can hold grit like a bulldog, resist loading, and let you breathe easier in a small shop without a giant extractor humming all day.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/cards/instagram/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/cards/instagram/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/cards/instagram/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Sic Versus Aluminum Oxide Differences</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 04 Nov 2025 02:51:33 +0000</pubDate><category>Abrasive Materials &amp; Compounds</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>dry sanding</category><category>clear coat</category><category>orbital sander</category><category>sanding block</category><description>Compare silicon carbide sandpaper and aluminum oxide to choose the right abrasive for wood, metal, and paint.

&lt;p&gt;On a quiet Saturday afternoon, you clamp down the last door of that heirloom dresser you’ve been restoring. The grain finally shows through the old varnish, but the surface still isn’t the mirror-smooth finish you pictured. You reach for a fresh sheet, feel the grit with your thumb, and hesitate—this is where the choice between silicon carbide sandpaper and aluminum oxide decides whether you’ll spend the evening admiring your work or chasing scratches you didn’t mean to make. Maybe you’re here because a paint finish went cloudy after dry sanding, or a clear coat took a hopscotch of swirls under shop lights. Or maybe your belt sander chewed through hook-and-loop discs like a wood chipper and you need something tougher and more predictable.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/instagram/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/instagram/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/instagram/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>13</readingTime></item><item><title>When Ceramic Outperforms Aluminum Oxide</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 13:34:14 +0000</pubDate><category>Ceramic &amp; Premium Abrasives</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-180</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>dry sanding</category><category>clear coat</category><category>orbital sander</category><category>dust control</category><description>Learn when ceramic sanding discs beat aluminum oxide: cut rate, heat control, cost per part, and pro tips for metal, wood, and composites.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="when-ceramic-sanding-discs-outperform-aluminum-oxide"&gt;When Ceramic Sanding Discs Outperform Aluminum Oxide&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a quiet Saturday morning, the garage becomes your studio. You’ve cleared a workbench, lined up clamps and rags, and lit the space with a warm shop lamp. The project is personal: a welded steel coffee table for the living room, something sturdy and simple that can hold the weight of everyday life. The first passes with a grinder feel hopeful—until the discs start glazing. Heat builds, paint smears, and the cut slows to a crawl. You switch to a finer grit, then back again, but the aluminum oxide discs keep dulling, forcing you to lean harder. The surface looks scuffed but not flat, and your shoulders ache from forcing the tool to do what the abrasive simply won’t.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Coarse Medium Fine And Ultra Fine Definitions</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/coarse-medium-fine-and-ultra-fine-definitions-sandpaper-grit/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/coarse-medium-fine-and-ultra-fine-definitions-sandpaper-grit/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 05:39:06 +0000</pubDate><category>Grit Range &amp; Classification</category><category>grit-101</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-180</category><category>clear coat</category><category>sanding block</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Understand coarse, medium, fine, and ultra fine sandpaper grit with practical steps, pro tips, and troubleshooting for flawless surfaces.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="coarse-to-ultra-fine-sandpaper-grit-decoded"&gt;Coarse to Ultra Fine: Sandpaper Grit Decoded&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning in the shop. Coffee on the bench, a drop cloth draped over a dented heirloom dresser you promised to rescue. You pull open the top drawer and the musty smell of old lacquer and stubborn pine dust hits the air. A sanding block lies beside a stack of sheets you picked up at the hardware store—some marked 60, others 120, 220, even 400. You know each number stands for a sandpaper grit, but right now they feel like a foreign language. The last time you “winged it,” you left swirl marks that telegraphed straight through your stain, and spent another weekend fixing what you rushed the first time.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/coarse-medium-fine-and-ultra-fine-definitions-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/coarse-medium-fine-and-ultra-fine-definitions-sandpaper-grit.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/coarse-medium-fine-and-ultra-fine-definitions-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/coarse-medium-fine-and-ultra-fine-definitions-sandpaper-grit.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/coarse-medium-fine-and-ultra-fine-definitions-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/coarse-medium-fine-and-ultra-fine-definitions-sandpaper-grit.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/coarse-medium-fine-and-ultra-fine-definitions-sandpaper-grit/cards/instagram/coarse-medium-fine-and-ultra-fine-definitions-sandpaper-grit.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/coarse-medium-fine-and-ultra-fine-definitions-sandpaper-grit/cards/instagram/coarse-medium-fine-and-ultra-fine-definitions-sandpaper-grit.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/coarse-medium-fine-and-ultra-fine-definitions-sandpaper-grit/cards/instagram/coarse-medium-fine-and-ultra-fine-definitions-sandpaper-grit.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/coarse-medium-fine-and-ultra-fine-definitions-sandpaper-grit/cards/pinterest/coarse-medium-fine-and-ultra-fine-definitions-sandpaper-grit.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/coarse-medium-fine-and-ultra-fine-definitions-sandpaper-grit/cards/pinterest/coarse-medium-fine-and-ultra-fine-definitions-sandpaper-grit.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/coarse-medium-fine-and-ultra-fine-definitions-sandpaper-grit/cards/pinterest/coarse-medium-fine-and-ultra-fine-definitions-sandpaper-grit.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/coarse-medium-fine-and-ultra-fine-definitions-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/coarse-medium-fine-and-ultra-fine-definitions-sandpaper-grit.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/coarse-medium-fine-and-ultra-fine-definitions-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/coarse-medium-fine-and-ultra-fine-definitions-sandpaper-grit.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/coarse-medium-fine-and-ultra-fine-definitions-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/coarse-medium-fine-and-ultra-fine-definitions-sandpaper-grit.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>When To Use Soft Versus Firm Interface Pads</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 05:14:43 +0000</pubDate><category>Interface Pads &amp; Backing Pads</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>clear coat</category><description>Learn when to use soft vs firm sander interface pads for smoother finishes, faster leveling, and fewer defects across woodworking and auto refinishing.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="soft-vs-firm-sander-interface-pad-when-to-choose"&gt;Soft vs Firm Sander Interface Pad: When to Choose&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It starts with dust floating in the morning light and a project that matters. Maybe it’s a maple dresser you’ve promised to refinish before the baby arrives, or a fender blend on a car that’s taken you months to prep. Your sander hums to life, and the first pass feels promising—until you notice faint scratches where the grain curves, or a rounded edge where you wanted a crisp line. The tool didn’t change. The abrasive didn’t change. The difference is the cushion between them: the sander interface pad. It’s a small layer, but it decides how much pressure reaches the surface, how evenly the grit cuts, and whether the final result shows craftsmanship or compromise.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/instagram/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/instagram/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/instagram/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/pinterest/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/pinterest/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/pinterest/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Prevent Swirl Marks With Random Orbital Sanders</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 02:33:16 +0000</pubDate><category>Random Orbital Sanding</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-800</category><category>dust control</category><category>grit progression</category><category>dry sanding</category><category>clear coat</category><category>orbital sander</category><description>Learn expert workflows to eliminate swirl marks with random orbital sanding—covering surface prep, abrasives, dust control, and inspection.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanding"&gt;Prevent Swirl Marks with Random Orbital Sanding&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning, low sun at the window, the first coat of finish flashes across the panel you’ve been nursing all week. The figure in the oak wakes up, but so do faint halos you didn’t see under shop lights. Swirl marks. You tilt the board, squint, and realize you were moments from locking those defects under a film for good. It’s a gut-punch that most woodworkers and finish carpenters eventually feel. The culprit is rarely the tool itself; it’s the stack of process decisions that lead to one outcome or the other. The relief is that processes are controllable, and with random orbital sanding done deliberately, swirls are optional.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding/cards/instagram/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding/cards/instagram/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding/cards/instagram/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding/cards/pinterest/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding/cards/pinterest/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding/cards/pinterest/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>13</readingTime></item><item><title>Difference Between Compounding And Polishing</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 02:16:29 +0000</pubDate><category>Polishing &amp; Finishing</category><category>mirror finish</category><category>polishing pads</category><category>grit progression</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-1200</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>clear coat</category><description>Learn the difference between compounding and polishing, how to choose polishing sandpaper and pads, and the step-by-step process for flawless finishes.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="compounding-vs-polishing-guide-to-polishing-sandpaper"&gt;Compounding vs Polishing: Guide to Polishing Sandpaper&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a moment every craftsperson recognizes: you step into the garage or studio, sunlight cuts across a painted panel or tabletop, and you see everything—swirls you never meant to leave, scratches that catch the light just so, a haze that dulls the color you spent hours applying. Your instinct might be to reach for the strongest product you own, but knowing the difference between compounding and polishing—and where polishing sandpaper fits—can save time, material, and the finish you’re trying to protect. Maybe it’s the clear coat on your daily driver, the lacquer on a guitar body, or the resin on a turned pen blank. Different surfaces, same goal: remove defects while preserving as much material as possible.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper/cards/instagram/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper/cards/instagram/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper/cards/instagram/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Grit Progression For Aluminum Before Buffing</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/02/grit-progression-for-aluminum-before-buffing-metal-polishing/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/02/grit-progression-for-aluminum-before-buffing-metal-polishing/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 02 Nov 2025 23:37:34 +0000</pubDate><category>Metal Polishing &amp; Rust Repair</category><category>metal polishing</category><category>grit progression</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>clear coat</category><category>sanding block</category><description>Learn grit progression for aluminum and master metal polishing.

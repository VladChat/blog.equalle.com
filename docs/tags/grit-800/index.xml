&lt;p&gt;The room is quiet except for the soft whirr of a 5-inch random orbital sander. You’ve invested hours pouring a resin river through a slab of maple, watched the swirl of pigment lock under crystal clarity, and now you’re finally leveling the surface for that glass-smooth finish. Then it happens—under the pad, the epoxy feels different. The sander drags, the dust turns to smeary ribbons, and the finish dulls into a gummy haze. If you’ve experienced that sinking feeling, you’ve already met the enemy of precision finishing: heat buildup.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/29.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding/cards/instagram/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding/cards/instagram/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding/cards/instagram/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding/cards/pinterest/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding/cards/pinterest/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding/cards/pinterest/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Best Grits For Leveling Primer</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 12 Dec 2025 14:45:24 +0000</pubDate><category>PSA Discs</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-500</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>clear coat</category><category>wet sanding</category><description>Engineer-tested guide to the best grits for leveling primer.

&lt;p&gt;Saturday mornings in my garage start with coffee, a quiet radio, and a panel that still holds a map of yesterday’s imperfections. The primer is flat gray, but under a raking light you can read it like topography—little ridges around a dent repair, faint peel from a heavy pass, and that one shallow wave you only see when you step back. I’ve learned that this is where the paint job is actually won or lost, not in the clear coat. And the tools matter: the block, the sander orbit, the mineral in the abrasive, even the adhesive that bonds the disc. When I swapped to psa sanding discs on a rigid interface for the first “leveling” cut, I noticed two things right away—straighter panels and fewer surprises after sealer.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/13.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Identify Hard Factory Coating Versus Simple Surface Oxidation</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 13:41:15 +0000</pubDate><category>Headlight Restoration</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>clear coat</category><description>Learn to spot hard factory coatings vs. simple oxidation on plastics, then restore safely with step-by-step sanding, polishing, and protection.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="plastic-oxidation-removal-coating-vs-surface-oxide"&gt;Plastic Oxidation Removal: Coating vs. Surface Oxide&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning in the shop, coffee ring on the bench, you wipe a thumb across a chalky ATV fender and it ghosts your finger white. Ten feet away, the headlight lens on your daily driver looks foggy and amber; a quick pass with glass cleaner does nothing. On a trailer, the kayak’s once-deep orange now reads as flat and pinkish. If you’ve been hunting for plastic oxidation removal tips, you’re halfway there—but here’s the catch: not all dull plastic is just oxidation. Sometimes you’re seeing degradation of a hard factory coating, and sometimes it’s a thin film of chalk oxidized from the base material itself. Treat them the same and you’ll either stop too early—leaving haze—or go too far—burning through a protective layer you actually needed.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/20.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation/cards/facebook/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation/cards/facebook/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation/cards/facebook/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation/cards/instagram/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation/cards/instagram/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation/cards/instagram/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation/cards/pinterest/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation/cards/pinterest/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation/cards/pinterest/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation/cards/facebook/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation/cards/facebook/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation/cards/facebook/identify-hard-factory-coating-versus-simple-surface-oxidation-plastic-oxidation.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>What Grit To Sand Furniture Before Applying Stain</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 07 Dec 2025 13:31:13 +0000</pubDate><category>Furniture Refinishing</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-800</category><category>orbital sander</category><category>sanding block</category><category>dust control</category><description>Learn the exact sanding grits, workflows, and checks that drive even stain color and professional results on furniture projects.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="stain-preparation-what-grit-to-sand-furniture"&gt;Stain Preparation: What Grit to Sand Furniture&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a quiet Saturday morning, you clear the dining table and pull the tarp tight. The surface is a patchwork of rings, scratches, and a few mystery stains from a previous life—nothing that an orbital sander and a little patience can’t fix. The smell of sawdust arrives quickly, and with it a deceptively simple choice: what grit to sand furniture before applying stain. There are plenty of opinions, but only one proper sequence for your species, stain type, and condition of the substrate. That decision—more than the brand of stain or even your brushing technique—will decide whether the grain pops evenly or blotches, whether the edges stay crisp or burn through, and whether your topcoat glides over a consistent scratch pattern or amplifies every swirl mark. Done right, stain preparation becomes a repeatable, almost meditative routine that pays off with reliable, beautiful finishes.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/08.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation/cards/facebook/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation/cards/facebook/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation/cards/facebook/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation/cards/instagram/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation/cards/instagram/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation/cards/instagram/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation/cards/pinterest/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation/cards/pinterest/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation/cards/pinterest/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation/cards/facebook/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation/cards/facebook/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation/cards/facebook/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>How To Find Hidden Cross Grain Scratches Before Finishing</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/06/how-to-find-hidden-cross-grain-scratches-before-finishing-cross-grain-scratch-re/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/06/how-to-find-hidden-cross-grain-scratches-before-finishing-cross-grain-scratch-re/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 06 Dec 2025 13:32:43 +0000</pubDate><category>Wood sanding</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit progression</category><category>clear coat</category><description>Learn how to spot hidden cross-grain scratches before finishing, with lighting, guide coats, and sanding strategies for flawless results.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="cross-grain-scratch-removal-find-flaws-before-finish"&gt;Cross-grain scratch removal: find flaws before finish&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s late in the day, and the shop is quiet enough to hear your own breath. You’ve planed, scraped, and sanded a walnut tabletop into a silky plane that reflects light like calm water. The first wipe of finish goes on and your shoulders loosen—until the sheen turns and a faint zebra pattern ghosts across the surface. There they are: those fine cross-grain scratches that seemed invisible a moment ago, now stark under the finish. We talk a lot about sanding sequences, but the real craft is knowing how to find the marks you can’t yet see—and to do it before a finish locks them in forever. That’s the heart of cross-grain scratch removal: finding and fixing the tiny, off-direction lines that explode under dye, oil, or film, and keeping them from stealing focus from the piece you worked so hard to build.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/06.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/06/how-to-find-hidden-cross-grain-scratches-before-finishing-cross-grain-scratch-re/cards/facebook/how-to-find-hidden-cross-grain-scratches-before-finishing-cross-grain-scratch-re.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/06/how-to-find-hidden-cross-grain-scratches-before-finishing-cross-grain-scratch-re/cards/facebook/how-to-find-hidden-cross-grain-scratches-before-finishing-cross-grain-scratch-re.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/06/how-to-find-hidden-cross-grain-scratches-before-finishing-cross-grain-scratch-re/cards/facebook/how-to-find-hidden-cross-grain-scratches-before-finishing-cross-grain-scratch-re.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/06/how-to-find-hidden-cross-grain-scratches-before-finishing-cross-grain-scratch-re/cards/instagram/how-to-find-hidden-cross-grain-scratches-before-finishing-cross-grain-scratch-re.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/06/how-to-find-hidden-cross-grain-scratches-before-finishing-cross-grain-scratch-re/cards/instagram/how-to-find-hidden-cross-grain-scratches-before-finishing-cross-grain-scratch-re.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/06/how-to-find-hidden-cross-grain-scratches-before-finishing-cross-grain-scratch-re/cards/instagram/how-to-find-hidden-cross-grain-scratches-before-finishing-cross-grain-scratch-re.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/06/how-to-find-hidden-cross-grain-scratches-before-finishing-cross-grain-scratch-re/cards/pinterest/how-to-find-hidden-cross-grain-scratches-before-finishing-cross-grain-scratch-re.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/06/how-to-find-hidden-cross-grain-scratches-before-finishing-cross-grain-scratch-re/cards/pinterest/how-to-find-hidden-cross-grain-scratches-before-finishing-cross-grain-scratch-re.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/06/how-to-find-hidden-cross-grain-scratches-before-finishing-cross-grain-scratch-re/cards/pinterest/how-to-find-hidden-cross-grain-scratches-before-finishing-cross-grain-scratch-re.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/06/how-to-find-hidden-cross-grain-scratches-before-finishing-cross-grain-scratch-re/cards/facebook/how-to-find-hidden-cross-grain-scratches-before-finishing-cross-grain-scratch-re.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/06/how-to-find-hidden-cross-grain-scratches-before-finishing-cross-grain-scratch-re/cards/facebook/how-to-find-hidden-cross-grain-scratches-before-finishing-cross-grain-scratch-re.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/06/how-to-find-hidden-cross-grain-scratches-before-finishing-cross-grain-scratch-re/cards/facebook/how-to-find-hidden-cross-grain-scratches-before-finishing-cross-grain-scratch-re.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Wrap Sandpaper Around Dowels For Curved Edges</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 05 Dec 2025 13:37:54 +0000</pubDate><category>Hand Sanding Techniques</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Practical guide to hand sanding curved edges by wrapping sandpaper around dowels; testing abrasives, grits, and jigs for consistent radii.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="hand-sanding-curves-wrap-paper-around-dowels"&gt;Hand Sanding Curves: Wrap Paper Around Dowels&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember the first time a curve made me question my craft. It was a walnut keepsake box with a lid that looked perfect on CAD: a soft 10 mm radius running cleanly along all four edges. On the bench, though, the radius fought back. My block sander flattened the apex, my random-orbit sander skated off the edge, and every “shortcut” I tried left flats and chatter marks that showed up under finish like neon. I finally reached for the simplest tool in the shop: a hardwood dowel, a strip of abrasive, and my hands. With careful hand sanding—wrapping the paper around a dowel that matched the profile—the radius began to read as a continuous curve instead of a sequence of mistakes. The tactile feedback told me where the high spots were; the scratch pattern told me when I was pushing too hard.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/02.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding/cards/instagram/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding/cards/instagram/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding/cards/instagram/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding/cards/pinterest/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding/cards/pinterest/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding/cards/pinterest/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Open Coat Versus Closed Coat Impacts</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 13:41:49 +0000</pubDate><category>Abrasive Materials &amp; Compounds</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-1200</category><description>Open vs closed coat sanding explained with lab-tested data.

&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning in the shop is supposed to be simple: one mug of coffee, a walnut desktop to final-sand, and a couple of hours of quiet before the house wakes up. Instead, at pass number fifteen, the paper glazes over. The dust lines smear into the grain, and the sander’s pitch changes—a small but telling protest. I switch sheets, still chasing that consistent, haze-free scratch pattern. When I move to wet-sand a lacquer test panel, silicon carbide sandpaper comes out of the drawer—its black grit and smooth backing a distinct contrast to the tan aluminum oxide I’ve used on the walnut. Ten minutes later, I’m flattening a glued-up end-grain cutting board, then stepping over to clean up a steel plane body. Same sander, same operator, but suddenly my results diverge depending on one detail I often overlook: how densely the abrasive grains were packed onto the paper in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/23.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/instagram/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/instagram/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/instagram/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Slurry Management During Wet Grinding</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/03/slurry-management-during-wet-grinding-concrete-polishing/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/03/slurry-management-during-wet-grinding-concrete-polishing/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 03 Dec 2025 13:41:04 +0000</pubDate><category>Stone &amp; Concrete Polishing</category><category>grit-40</category><category>grit-70</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Learn expert slurry management for wet grinding and concrete polishing—chemistry, tooling, workflow, and compliance to deliver consistent, high-gloss floors.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="wet-grinding-slurry-control-for-concrete-polishing"&gt;Wet Grinding Slurry Control for Concrete Polishing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s 6:10 a.m. in a silent warehouse. Air is cool, lights are still buzzing to full brightness, and the crew is rolling out hoses and laying edge-protection mats with the practiced choreography of a hundred previous jobs. The general contractor walks the space with a client, tracing imagined traffic patterns in the air: this will be a public lobby, high reflectivity, no coating, a breathable sheen that wears in gracefully, not off in flakes. On-site expectations like these live or die by process discipline. Everyone agrees on the end state—clean clarity, sharp aggregate reveal—but the real determinant of that result begins long before the burnish. It starts with water, abrasives, and the wet byproduct the team will generate hour after hour. It starts with slurry.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/21.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/03/slurry-management-during-wet-grinding-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/slurry-management-during-wet-grinding-concrete-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/03/slurry-management-during-wet-grinding-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/slurry-management-during-wet-grinding-concrete-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/03/slurry-management-during-wet-grinding-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/slurry-management-during-wet-grinding-concrete-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/03/slurry-management-during-wet-grinding-concrete-polishing/cards/instagram/slurry-management-during-wet-grinding-concrete-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/03/slurry-management-during-wet-grinding-concrete-polishing/cards/instagram/slurry-management-during-wet-grinding-concrete-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/03/slurry-management-during-wet-grinding-concrete-polishing/cards/instagram/slurry-management-during-wet-grinding-concrete-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/03/slurry-management-during-wet-grinding-concrete-polishing/cards/pinterest/slurry-management-during-wet-grinding-concrete-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/03/slurry-management-during-wet-grinding-concrete-polishing/cards/pinterest/slurry-management-during-wet-grinding-concrete-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/03/slurry-management-during-wet-grinding-concrete-polishing/cards/pinterest/slurry-management-during-wet-grinding-concrete-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/03/slurry-management-during-wet-grinding-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/slurry-management-during-wet-grinding-concrete-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/03/slurry-management-during-wet-grinding-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/slurry-management-during-wet-grinding-concrete-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/03/slurry-management-during-wet-grinding-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/slurry-management-during-wet-grinding-concrete-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Refine To 2000–3000 For Quick Polish</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 01 Dec 2025 15:17:23 +0000</pubDate><category>Plastic &amp; Epoxy Sanding</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>Master epoxy sanding from 800 to 2000–3000 grit for a fast, haze-free polish with pro-level technique, abrasives, and workflow control.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="epoxy-sanding-quick-polish-at-20003000-grit"&gt;Epoxy Sanding: Quick Polish at 2000–3000 Grit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You set the project down with both hands, the way you place a full coffee mug on a brand-new table—carefully, like it could bruise. Yesterday it was a cloudy slab: dust nibs, tiny ripples, a faint orange peel. Today, it’s close. Under the shop LEDs, you can already see straight lines in the reflection, but not a perfect mirror—still a little fog, still a couple of shallow witness lines that your eyes keep returning to. The moment is tempting: grab a compound and try to bully the gloss into existence. But you’ve done this long enough to know that shine doesn’t come from polish alone; it’s earned in the scratch pattern. This is where epoxy sanding decides whether you’ll be buffing for minutes or for hours, whether the finish will hold up in sunlight or betray you with haloed swirls.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/13.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding/cards/instagram/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding/cards/instagram/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding/cards/instagram/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding/cards/pinterest/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding/cards/pinterest/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding/cards/pinterest/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>When To Choose Trizact Style Abrasives</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 01 Dec 2025 13:40:34 +0000</pubDate><category>Specialty Abrasives</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Learn when to choose Trizact style abrasives vs microfinishing film.

&lt;p&gt;The shop is quiet in the way only focused work can create—overhead lights humming, a small radio whispering in the corner, and the soft, steady rasp of a belt skimming steel. You’ve shaped a kitchen knife from bar stock, or maybe you’re prepping a classic car panel after welding in a patch. The hard work is done, but the finish is still miles away from what you picture: clean, even, and confident. You swap belts, try a different disc, lighten pressure, and still those stubborn lines hang on. Do you step to a more aggressive grit? Switch to a finer one? Or change the abrasive altogether?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/11.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film/cards/instagram/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film/cards/instagram/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film/cards/instagram/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film/cards/pinterest/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film/cards/pinterest/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film/cards/pinterest/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Cut Rate And Loading Behavior By Grain</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2025 00:57:05 +0000</pubDate><category>Abrasive Materials &amp; Compounds</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>clear coat</category><category>orbital sander</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>Engineer’s guide to silicon carbide sandpaper—cut rate, loading, grain physics, and practical tips to choose the right abrasive for paint, metal, and</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="silicon-carbide-sandpaper-cut-rate-and-loading"&gt;Silicon Carbide Sandpaper: Cut Rate and Loading&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning in the garage, the air smelled faintly of cut clear coat and soapy water. A half-finished motorcycle tank sat on a foam cradle, its orange peel and dust nibs highlighted by a raking LED panel. I’d already tried a few sheets of 1500 grit from a contractor pack, but they stalled after a few passes, loading with milky slurry and leaving stray scratches that would require more polish later. This is the moment that separates a casual sand from a dependable workflow—the point where abrasive choice dictates not just speed, but consistency and finish quality. Swapping to silicon carbide sandpaper felt like a small change, but it reset the process: faster leveling, more controllable scratch patterns, and fewer surprise defects.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/09.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/instagram/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/instagram/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/instagram/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Choose Pad And Compound For Plastics</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 13:37:22 +0000</pubDate><category>Resin Polishing</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>grit progression</category><category>sanding block</category><category>polishing pads</category><description>Engineer’s guide to resin polishing: pick the right pad and compound for acrylic, polycarbonate, and epoxy.

&lt;p&gt;On a quiet Saturday, I watched a friend slowly lower a buffing pad onto the cloudy edge of his epoxy river table. The coffee mugs had left fine scuffs; sunlight turned them into halos. He’d already tried an all-purpose metal polish and a “universal” wool pad—both grabbed hard, smeared the surface, and left the epoxy warmer than I liked. He looked at me and asked the question I hear weekly: “Which pad and which compound do I actually use for plastics?” It’s an honest question with costly consequences if you guess wrong. Unlike metal paint systems that tolerate a surprising amount of heat and pressure, plastics and cured resins can haze, smear, or stress-craze from a few seconds of the wrong contact.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/01.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/cards/instagram/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/cards/instagram/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/cards/instagram/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/cards/pinterest/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/cards/pinterest/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/cards/pinterest/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>13</readingTime></item><item><title>Choose Wool Foam Or Microfiber Pads</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 16:03:08 +0000</pubDate><category>Polishing &amp; Finishing</category><category>mirror finish</category><category>polishing pads</category><category>grit progression</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-2500</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>clear coat</category><category>sanding block</category><description>Engineer-tested guide to choosing wool, foam, or microfiber pads—and when to pair them with polishing sandpaper—for faster, safer, glossier results.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-with-polishing-sandpaper"&gt;Wool, Foam, or Microfiber Pads with Polishing Sandpaper&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a quiet Saturday morning, you tape off the trim, load your polisher, and stare at the paint under bright LEDs. Swirls dance across the clear coat, with a few deeper scratches that refuse to disappear. You’ve got compounds lined up, pads sorted into neatly labeled bins, and sheets of polishing sandpaper ready if the defects demand leveling. Yet the question lingers: which pad material will get you there fastest, without overheating, over-thinning the clear, or leaving haze to chase?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/27.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper/cards/instagram/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper/cards/instagram/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper/cards/instagram/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Remove Dust Nibs Between Clear Coat Layers</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 14:29:42 +0000</pubDate><category>Between-Coats Sanding</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-500</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>clear coat</category><category>dust control</category><category>wet sanding</category><description>Expert guide to between coats sanding—how to remove dust nibs, choose abrasives, and perfect clear coat finishes with pro-level workflows.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="between-coats-sanding-remove-dust-nibs-in-clear-coats"&gt;between coats sanding: remove dust nibs in clear coats&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A flawless clear coat is more than gloss; it’s the tactile confidence you feel when your hand glides across a panel with zero grit or drag. If you’ve ever stepped back from a gorgeous piece—be it a walnut tabletop, a painted cabinet door, or a guitar body—only to see and feel the specks of dust that settled into the finish, you know the sting. Those tiny dust nibs are an inevitable reality of shop air, static, and curing dynamics. Fortunately, they’re also manageable with disciplined surface prep, controlled technique, and smart abrasive choices. That’s the core of between coats sanding: deliberate, minimal-material removal focused on de-nibbing without compromising film build or clarity.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/25.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding/cards/instagram/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding/cards/instagram/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding/cards/instagram/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding/cards/pinterest/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding/cards/pinterest/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding/cards/pinterest/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Scratch Pattern Control For Metal Panels Before Primer</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2025 15:09:37 +0000</pubDate><category>Metal Polishing &amp; Rust Repair</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><description>Learn expert scratch pattern control for metal panels before primer with step-by-step sanding, tool choices, and troubleshooting from a pro workshop</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="metal-surface-sanding-scratch-control-before-primer"&gt;Metal Surface Sanding: Scratch Control Before Primer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The evening a panel is finally quiet is when the real work begins. You kill the grinder, and suddenly it’s just you, a breath of solvent in the air, and sheet metal that shows everything—every ding mapped by light, every shallow wave you swore wasn’t there in the morning. I’ve been there with a door skin laid across sawhorses, work lamp low and unforgiving, palm testing the temperature of steel that still remembers the sander.

&lt;p&gt;The sun wasn’t up yet, but the garage light threw a harsh circle over the hood of a ten-year-old hatchback. I’d taped plastic sheeting around the fenders the night before, masked the trim, and laid out abrasives like a surgeon prepping instruments—400, 600, 2000. Anyone who’s driven at night behind hazed lenses knows that dim, anxious feeling—like the road keeps secrets from you. This morning was about clarity, not just looks. It was about performance. And if you’ve ever tried plastic headlight polishing after sanding to 2000 grit and still seen a spiderweb of marks in the reflection, you know the question lurking at the bottom of the bottle: compound or polish? Both promise clarity. Both spin a story of micro-abrasives and gloss. But which one actually erases the last of those 2000 grit tracks in polycarbonate, and which only glides over them?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/19.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-to-remove-2000-grit-sanding-marks-plastic-headlight-polis/cards/facebook/compound-versus-polish-to-remove-2000-grit-sanding-marks-plastic-headlight-polis.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-to-remove-2000-grit-sanding-marks-plastic-headlight-polis/cards/facebook/compound-versus-polish-to-remove-2000-grit-sanding-marks-plastic-headlight-polis.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-to-remove-2000-grit-sanding-marks-plastic-headlight-polis/cards/facebook/compound-versus-polish-to-remove-2000-grit-sanding-marks-plastic-headlight-polis.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-to-remove-2000-grit-sanding-marks-plastic-headlight-polis/cards/instagram/compound-versus-polish-to-remove-2000-grit-sanding-marks-plastic-headlight-polis.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-to-remove-2000-grit-sanding-marks-plastic-headlight-polis/cards/instagram/compound-versus-polish-to-remove-2000-grit-sanding-marks-plastic-headlight-polis.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-to-remove-2000-grit-sanding-marks-plastic-headlight-polis/cards/instagram/compound-versus-polish-to-remove-2000-grit-sanding-marks-plastic-headlight-polis.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-to-remove-2000-grit-sanding-marks-plastic-headlight-polis/cards/pinterest/compound-versus-polish-to-remove-2000-grit-sanding-marks-plastic-headlight-polis.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-to-remove-2000-grit-sanding-marks-plastic-headlight-polis/cards/pinterest/compound-versus-polish-to-remove-2000-grit-sanding-marks-plastic-headlight-polis.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-to-remove-2000-grit-sanding-marks-plastic-headlight-polis/cards/pinterest/compound-versus-polish-to-remove-2000-grit-sanding-marks-plastic-headlight-polis.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-to-remove-2000-grit-sanding-marks-plastic-headlight-polis/cards/facebook/compound-versus-polish-to-remove-2000-grit-sanding-marks-plastic-headlight-polis.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-to-remove-2000-grit-sanding-marks-plastic-headlight-polis/cards/facebook/compound-versus-polish-to-remove-2000-grit-sanding-marks-plastic-headlight-polis.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-to-remove-2000-grit-sanding-marks-plastic-headlight-polis/cards/facebook/compound-versus-polish-to-remove-2000-grit-sanding-marks-plastic-headlight-polis.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Compound Versus Polish Differences For Clear Coat Finishing</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2025 05:56:37 +0000</pubDate><category>Wet Sanding Clear Coat</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-2500</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>clear coat</category><category>wet sanding</category><description>Understand compound vs polish for clear coat finishing with sanding workflows, abrasive selection, and process control for defect-free paint polishing.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="paint-polishing-compound-vs-polish-for-clear-coat"&gt;Paint polishing: compound vs polish for clear coat&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Saturday morning sun can be the most unforgiving inspector you’ll ever meet. You back the car out after a late-night respray—coffee in hand, optimism high—and the light slices across the hood like a straightedge. Orange peel you knew about, sure. But then the swirls appear, whisper-fine arcs barely visible at dusk now glaring at full volume. You feel them before you see them: the drag of a microfiber catching on texture, the way your eyes follow a ghosty hologram around a curved fender. This is the moment when “wash and wax” ends and craft begins—where surface preparation, abrasive control, and paint polishing decide whether you get a mirror or a mirage.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/17.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing/cards/facebook/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing/cards/facebook/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing/cards/facebook/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing/cards/instagram/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing/cards/instagram/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing/cards/instagram/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing/cards/pinterest/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing/cards/pinterest/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing/cards/pinterest/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing/cards/facebook/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing/cards/facebook/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing/cards/facebook/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Best Grit To Sand Epoxy Primer Before Filler Or Sealer</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/best-grit-to-sand-epoxy-primer-before-filler-or-sealer-primer-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/best-grit-to-sand-epoxy-primer-before-filler-or-sealer-primer-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2025 05:25:06 +0000</pubDate><category>Auto Body Sanding</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-200</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><description>Learn the best grit to sand epoxy primer before filler or sealer, with pro techniques, workflows, and troubleshooting for a paint-ready surface.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="primer-sanding-grits-for-epoxy-before-filler-or-sealer"&gt;Primer Sanding Grits for Epoxy Before Filler or Sealer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning, the garage door yawns open and the light falls across your project—maybe it’s the fender you’ve wrestled straight after months of small fixes, or a truck hood you promised yourself you’d finish before the weather turns. The radio is low, the coffee is cooling, and the bench is lined with sandpaper packs in every color and number. You know this stage matters: what you do next determines whether your basecoat glides on like glass or telegraphs every ripple, pinhole, and scratch. But there’s a nagging question poised at the edge of the workbench. What grit is right for epoxy right now? Is 80 too coarse, 320 too fine? Where does sealer fit? That’s the difference between a finish you’re proud to show and one you’ll forever see in harsh afternoon light.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/15.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/best-grit-to-sand-epoxy-primer-before-filler-or-sealer-primer-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-to-sand-epoxy-primer-before-filler-or-sealer-primer-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/best-grit-to-sand-epoxy-primer-before-filler-or-sealer-primer-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-to-sand-epoxy-primer-before-filler-or-sealer-primer-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/best-grit-to-sand-epoxy-primer-before-filler-or-sealer-primer-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-to-sand-epoxy-primer-before-filler-or-sealer-primer-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/best-grit-to-sand-epoxy-primer-before-filler-or-sealer-primer-sanding/cards/instagram/best-grit-to-sand-epoxy-primer-before-filler-or-sealer-primer-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/best-grit-to-sand-epoxy-primer-before-filler-or-sealer-primer-sanding/cards/instagram/best-grit-to-sand-epoxy-primer-before-filler-or-sealer-primer-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/best-grit-to-sand-epoxy-primer-before-filler-or-sealer-primer-sanding/cards/instagram/best-grit-to-sand-epoxy-primer-before-filler-or-sealer-primer-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/best-grit-to-sand-epoxy-primer-before-filler-or-sealer-primer-sanding/cards/pinterest/best-grit-to-sand-epoxy-primer-before-filler-or-sealer-primer-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/best-grit-to-sand-epoxy-primer-before-filler-or-sealer-primer-sanding/cards/pinterest/best-grit-to-sand-epoxy-primer-before-filler-or-sealer-primer-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/best-grit-to-sand-epoxy-primer-before-filler-or-sealer-primer-sanding/cards/pinterest/best-grit-to-sand-epoxy-primer-before-filler-or-sealer-primer-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/best-grit-to-sand-epoxy-primer-before-filler-or-sealer-primer-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-to-sand-epoxy-primer-before-filler-or-sealer-primer-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/best-grit-to-sand-epoxy-primer-before-filler-or-sealer-primer-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-to-sand-epoxy-primer-before-filler-or-sealer-primer-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/best-grit-to-sand-epoxy-primer-before-filler-or-sealer-primer-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-to-sand-epoxy-primer-before-filler-or-sealer-primer-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Level 4 Versus Level 5 Wall Finish Explained</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/level-4-versus-level-5-wall-finish-explained-wall-finishing/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/level-4-versus-level-5-wall-finish-explained-wall-finishing/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2025 21:32:57 +0000</pubDate><category>Drywall Sanding</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-800</category><category>joint compound</category><category>clear coat</category><description>Engineer’s guide to Level 4 vs Level 5 drywall: optics, materials, costs, tests, and tips to choose the right wall finishing for paint and lighting.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="level-4-vs-level-5-wall-finishing-explained"&gt;Level 4 vs Level 5 Wall Finishing Explained&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even before the paint dries, the room tells you what you need to know. You step into a newly built living room at dusk. The pendant over the kitchen island throws a narrow cone; the western window sends a low, grazing wash across the longest wall. With the light switch up, the seams show themselves—not as obvious ridges, but as faint bands where reflectance changes with every step. The drywallers did everything “by the book.” Joints are filled, feathered, and sanded. Primer looks even. But the optics betray the truth: the wall absorbs and reflects differently where paper meets compound. That’s the moment when wall finishing becomes the difference between “good” and “finished.”&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/level-4-versus-level-5-wall-finish-explained-wall-finishing/cards/facebook/level-4-versus-level-5-wall-finish-explained-wall-finishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/level-4-versus-level-5-wall-finish-explained-wall-finishing/cards/facebook/level-4-versus-level-5-wall-finish-explained-wall-finishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/level-4-versus-level-5-wall-finish-explained-wall-finishing/cards/facebook/level-4-versus-level-5-wall-finish-explained-wall-finishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/level-4-versus-level-5-wall-finish-explained-wall-finishing/cards/instagram/level-4-versus-level-5-wall-finish-explained-wall-finishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/level-4-versus-level-5-wall-finish-explained-wall-finishing/cards/instagram/level-4-versus-level-5-wall-finish-explained-wall-finishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/level-4-versus-level-5-wall-finish-explained-wall-finishing/cards/instagram/level-4-versus-level-5-wall-finish-explained-wall-finishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/level-4-versus-level-5-wall-finish-explained-wall-finishing/cards/pinterest/level-4-versus-level-5-wall-finish-explained-wall-finishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/level-4-versus-level-5-wall-finish-explained-wall-finishing/cards/pinterest/level-4-versus-level-5-wall-finish-explained-wall-finishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/level-4-versus-level-5-wall-finish-explained-wall-finishing/cards/pinterest/level-4-versus-level-5-wall-finish-explained-wall-finishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/level-4-versus-level-5-wall-finish-explained-wall-finishing/cards/facebook/level-4-versus-level-5-wall-finish-explained-wall-finishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/level-4-versus-level-5-wall-finish-explained-wall-finishing/cards/facebook/level-4-versus-level-5-wall-finish-explained-wall-finishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/level-4-versus-level-5-wall-finish-explained-wall-finishing/cards/facebook/level-4-versus-level-5-wall-finish-explained-wall-finishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Film Backing For Uniform Fine Scratches</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 08 Nov 2025 13:28:53 +0000</pubDate><category>Backing Types &amp; Coatings</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>orbital sander</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>Engineer-tested guidance on film-backed, open coat sandpaper for uniform fine scratches, with data, setups, and grit sequencing tips.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="open-coat-sandpaper-on-film-for-fine-scratches"&gt;Open coat sandpaper on film for fine scratches&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The raking light told the truth I didn’t want to hear. After an hour shaping a walnut desktop, the surface looked perfect under diffuse shop lights—but the morning sun found every swirl and pigtail. I’d sanded carefully, stepped through grits, and kept the pad moving. Still, the micro-scratches telegraphed through as soon as I wiped on mineral spirits. That’s the moment I switched to film-backed abrasives and, crucially, open coat sandpaper for the early and mid-grits. The difference wasn’t subtle; it was measurable.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/instagram/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/instagram/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/instagram/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>When To Choose Ceramic Over Sic</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 08 Nov 2025 02:26:28 +0000</pubDate><category>Abrasive Materials &amp; Compounds</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><description>Learn when ceramic abrasives outperform silicon carbide sandpaper for metals, composites, and coatings, with actionable workflows and pro surface-prep tips.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="choosing-ceramic-vs-silicon-carbide-sandpaper"&gt;Choosing Ceramic vs Silicon Carbide Sandpaper&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can hear it before you see it: the sander spins up, the deck light pools across a panel, and the first passes scratch a story into the surface. On a chilly Saturday morning, I’m in a small body shop with two stacks on the cart—one ceramic-oxide disc set, one pile of silicon carbide sandpaper sheets. The job is a split personality: strip rust from a welded bracket, level high-build primer on a fender, then color-sand a fresh clear coat. The wrong abrasive wastes time and ruins finish; the right abrasive turns minutes into clean geometry and predictable gloss. And the smartest choice changes as the substrate, coating, and workflow change.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/instagram/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/instagram/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/instagram/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Washable Sanding Sponges For Longer Life</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 05 Nov 2025 16:30:43 +0000</pubDate><category>Sanding Sponges</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><description>Extend abrasive life with washable sanding sponges.

&lt;p&gt;You can hear it before you feel it: that faint change in pitch as a loaded abrasive skates across the surface rather than cutting it. In a small garage shop on a drizzly Saturday, a cabinetmaker pauses mid-pass, lifting his sanding sponge to the light. The face is clogged with a pale paste—sawdust and finish residue compacted into the foam’s pores. He hasn’t even reached final grit, but the cutting action is gone and heat is creeping in. In the past, this was when he would toss the sponge and reach for a new one, the cost quietly accumulating with every project. Today, he walks to the sink, rinses the sponge under lukewarm water, massages the face with a nylon brush, and watches the slurry shed away. Thirty seconds later, the abrasive bites again, the cut is cool and even, and the workflow stays on tempo.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge/cards/instagram/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge/cards/instagram/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge/cards/instagram/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge/cards/pinterest/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge/cards/pinterest/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge/cards/pinterest/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Best Wet Sanding Sequence For Plastic Headlight Lenses</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 05 Nov 2025 03:51:43 +0000</pubDate><category>Headlight Restoration</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-1200</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-2500</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>A precise, technical guide to wet lens sanding for plastic headlights—abrasives, workflows, and UV protection to restore clear, durable optics.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="best-lens-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlights"&gt;Best Lens Sanding Sequence for Plastic Headlights&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twilight is the worst time to discover your headlights are lying to you. Streetlights smear into blurry halos; lane markers fade into a matte wash. You feel yourself leaning forward in the seat as if posture could coax more lumens from the housings. But the problem isn’t the bulb; it’s the lens. Polycarbonate oxidizes, turns porous, and grows a diffuse surface that scatters light instead of transmitting it. That’s fixable if you stop thinking of restoration as a wipe-on miracle and start treating it like precision surface engineering. This guide is about real lens sanding—structured, wet, and sequential—not guessing with a single pad until it “looks better.”&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding/cards/facebook/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding/cards/facebook/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding/cards/facebook/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding/cards/instagram/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding/cards/instagram/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding/cards/instagram/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding/cards/pinterest/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding/cards/pinterest/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding/cards/pinterest/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding/cards/facebook/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding/cards/facebook/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding/cards/facebook/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Low Voc Binder Options For Abrasives</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 04 Nov 2025 03:24:31 +0000</pubDate><category>Eco &amp; Non-Toxic Abrasives</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-800</category><category>sanding block</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>clear coat</category><description>Low-VOC binder guide for eco sandpaper: materials, performance tradeoffs, and a step-by-step shop workflow for cleaner, pro-grade sanding.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="eco-sandpaper-low-voc-binder-options-that-work"&gt;Eco Sandpaper: Low-VOC Binder Options That Work&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know that smell the minute you crack open the shop on a warm morning—the stale bite of solvents baked into the air, the stuff that lingers in your nose long after the last pass with the sanding block. That’s the old world of abrasives talking. As a cabinetmaker turned workshop coach, I’ve logged hundreds of hours testing sheets, belts, and discs that either left my head buzzing or my surfaces butter-smooth. These days, the best of both worlds is real: low-VOC binders in eco sandpaper that can hold grit like a bulldog, resist loading, and let you breathe easier in a small shop without a giant extractor humming all day.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/cards/instagram/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/cards/instagram/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/cards/instagram/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Use Diamond Or Sic For Glass Edges</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 23:29:24 +0000</pubDate><category>Glass &amp; Ceramics Sanding</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-280</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1200</category><category>grit-2500</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>wet sanding</category><description>Technical guide to glass sanding for chip‑free edges using diamond or SiC abrasives, with grit sequences, coolant control, and polishing workflows.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="glass-sanding-for-clean-safe-edges-diamond-vs-sic"&gt;Glass sanding for clean, safe edges: diamond vs SiC&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The moment you lift a freshly cut pane, you feel it: the edge that looks fine from arm’s length but carries invisible threats—micro-chips, stress risers, and the slight granular drag under a fingertip that says the finish is not ready for handling. Anyone who has ever fit a glass shelf, framed a museum-grade print, or repurposed a bottle knows that the edge is where projects succeed or fail. That’s where glass sanding earns its keep. Thoughtful abrasive selection and disciplined technique turn a risky raw cut into a safe, optically clean edge that won’t shed fragments, haze, or propagate cracks under load. Whether you’re tuning a small arris for furniture-grade touch or chasing an optical polish on a laminated panel, the goal is the same: remove damage quickly, control heat, and leave a tight subsurface that won’t surprise you months later.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding/cards/instagram/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding/cards/instagram/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding/cards/instagram/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding/cards/pinterest/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding/cards/pinterest/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding/cards/pinterest/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>14</readingTime></item><item><title>Polish Epoxy Resin To Glass Like Finish</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 21:00:08 +0000</pubDate><category>Resin Polishing</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-1500</category><description>Learn how to polish epoxy resin to a glass-like finish with step-by-step sanding, heat control, compounds, and pro tips for durable clarity.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="resin-polishing-for-a-glass-like-epoxy-finish"&gt;Resin Polishing for a Glass-Like Epoxy Finish&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first time you run a fingertip across an epoxy surface, it’s a little magic trick. The light catches, colors bloom, and you expect the kind of clarity you see on showroom glass. But if you’ve poured, leveled, and cured resin yourself, you also know the moment that follows: under sunlight or a raking lamp, faint haze, scratch patterns, or tiny undulations whisper that the job isn’t quite done. That’s where resonant craftsmanship meets patience—where resin polishing turns a good pour into a gleaming, glass-like finish.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing/cards/instagram/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing/cards/instagram/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing/cards/instagram/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing/cards/pinterest/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing/cards/pinterest/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing/cards/pinterest/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>14</readingTime></item><item><title>Avoid Loading With Stearated Papers</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 20:47:55 +0000</pubDate><category>Plastic &amp; Epoxy Sanding</category><category>grit-280</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>dust control</category><category>grit progression</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>Master epoxy sanding without clogging.

&lt;p&gt;You know the moment: the shop is quiet, the resin river table catches morning light, and all you can see are tiny ridges, dust nibs, and a faint orange peel across that once-glassy pour. This is where projects are made—or marred. Epoxy sanding isn’t glamorous, but it’s the step that decides if your final finish looks like a mirror or a fogged window. And if you’ve ever had sandpaper load up in seconds, smear epoxy into gummy streaks, or clog your discs so fast you start doubting your gear, you’re not alone. I’ve been there—hands on the sander, vac humming, wondering why the surface keeps fighting back.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding/cards/instagram/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding/cards/instagram/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding/cards/instagram/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding/cards/pinterest/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding/cards/pinterest/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding/cards/pinterest/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Structured Abrasives For Predictable Cut</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/structured-abrasives-for-predictable-cut-microfinishing-film/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/structured-abrasives-for-predictable-cut-microfinishing-film/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 20:03:50 +0000</pubDate><category>Specialty Abrasives</category><category>grit-800</category><description>Engineer-tested guide to structured abrasives and microfinishing film for predictable cut, selection, process control, and repeatable surface finish.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="structured-abrasives-and-microfinishing-film-guide"&gt;Structured Abrasives and Microfinishing Film Guide&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few evenings ago I watched a machinist finish a crank journal by feel alone. The shop lights were warm, the radio low, and the final passes looked almost ceremonial—long, even strokes of a film-backed abrasive over an oil-wet rotating shaft. He paused, wiped the journal with a clean rag, and held a portable surface meter to the steel. The digital readout settled: within spec on the first try. That level of control doesn’t happen by accident; it’s a marriage of technique, process discipline, and the right abrasive architecture. In my experience, when you want a predictable cut and repeatable finish, structured abrasives and microfinishing film give you that control in a way conventional coated papers rarely can.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/structured-abrasives-for-predictable-cut-microfinishing-film/cards/facebook/structured-abrasives-for-predictable-cut-microfinishing-film.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/structured-abrasives-for-predictable-cut-microfinishing-film/cards/facebook/structured-abrasives-for-predictable-cut-microfinishing-film.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/structured-abrasives-for-predictable-cut-microfinishing-film/cards/facebook/structured-abrasives-for-predictable-cut-microfinishing-film.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/structured-abrasives-for-predictable-cut-microfinishing-film/cards/instagram/structured-abrasives-for-predictable-cut-microfinishing-film.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/structured-abrasives-for-predictable-cut-microfinishing-film/cards/instagram/structured-abrasives-for-predictable-cut-microfinishing-film.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/structured-abrasives-for-predictable-cut-microfinishing-film/cards/instagram/structured-abrasives-for-predictable-cut-microfinishing-film.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/structured-abrasives-for-predictable-cut-microfinishing-film/cards/pinterest/structured-abrasives-for-predictable-cut-microfinishing-film.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/structured-abrasives-for-predictable-cut-microfinishing-film/cards/pinterest/structured-abrasives-for-predictable-cut-microfinishing-film.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/structured-abrasives-for-predictable-cut-microfinishing-film/cards/pinterest/structured-abrasives-for-predictable-cut-microfinishing-film.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/structured-abrasives-for-predictable-cut-microfinishing-film/cards/facebook/structured-abrasives-for-predictable-cut-microfinishing-film.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/structured-abrasives-for-predictable-cut-microfinishing-film/cards/facebook/structured-abrasives-for-predictable-cut-microfinishing-film.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/structured-abrasives-for-predictable-cut-microfinishing-film/cards/facebook/structured-abrasives-for-predictable-cut-microfinishing-film.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Soak Time For Wet Sanding Papers</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 19:47:57 +0000</pubDate><category>Waterproof &amp; Wet/Dry Paper</category><category>grit-280</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-1200</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>wet sanding</category><description>Learn the optimal soak times for wet dry sandpaper, how soaking affects abrasive performance, and precise workflows for wood, paint, and metal.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="wet-dry-sandpaper-soak-times-a-technical-guide"&gt;Wet Dry Sandpaper Soak Times: A Technical Guide&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shop is quiet except for the slow drip from a rinse bottle, pooling across a workbench where a clear-coated guitar body breathes under the lights. There’s a shallow tray of clean water, a few folded sheets of wet dry sandpaper, and a foam pad waiting like a promise. You press a fingertip to the lacquer—weeks of curing have left it hard, crisp, and unforgiving. You remember the last time you rushed the process and chased pigtails under a glaring shop light. Not today. Today, the water will do its work before the first stroke lands.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/instagram/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/instagram/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/instagram/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Prevent Swirl Marks With Random Orbital Sanders</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 02:33:16 +0000</pubDate><category>Random Orbital Sanding</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-800</category><category>dust control</category><category>grit progression</category><category>dry sanding</category><category>clear coat</category><category>orbital sander</category><description>Learn expert workflows to eliminate swirl marks with random orbital sanding—covering surface prep, abrasives, dust control, and inspection.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanding"&gt;Prevent Swirl Marks with Random Orbital Sanding&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning, low sun at the window, the first coat of finish flashes across the panel you’ve been nursing all week. The figure in the oak wakes up, but so do faint halos you didn’t see under shop lights. Swirl marks. You tilt the board, squint, and realize you were moments from locking those defects under a film for good. It’s a gut-punch that most woodworkers and finish carpenters eventually feel. The culprit is rarely the tool itself; it’s the stack of process decisions that lead to one outcome or the other. The relief is that processes are controllable, and with random orbital sanding done deliberately, swirls are optional.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding/cards/instagram/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding/cards/instagram/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding/cards/instagram/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding/cards/pinterest/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding/cards/pinterest/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding/cards/pinterest/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>13</readingTime></item><item><title>Difference Between Compounding And Polishing</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 02:16:29 +0000</pubDate><category>Polishing &amp; Finishing</category><category>mirror finish</category><category>polishing pads</category><category>grit progression</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-1200</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>clear coat</category><description>Learn the difference between compounding and polishing, how to choose polishing sandpaper and pads, and the step-by-step process for flawless finishes.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="compounding-vs-polishing-guide-to-polishing-sandpaper"&gt;Compounding vs Polishing: Guide to Polishing Sandpaper&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a moment every craftsperson recognizes: you step into the garage or studio, sunlight cuts across a painted panel or tabletop, and you see everything—swirls you never meant to leave, scratches that catch the light just so, a haze that dulls the color you spent hours applying. Your instinct might be to reach for the strongest product you own, but knowing the difference between compounding and polishing—and where polishing sandpaper fits—can save time, material, and the finish you’re trying to protect. Maybe it’s the clear coat on your daily driver, the lacquer on a guitar body, or the resin on a turned pen blank. Different surfaces, same goal: remove defects while preserving as much material as possible.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper/cards/instagram/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper/cards/instagram/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper/cards/instagram/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item></channel></rss>

&lt;p&gt;A winter evening, the kitchen lights are low, and the cutting board you glued up yesterday is resting on the counter, checkerboard end grain catching the warm glow. You run a hand over the surface and feel proud—until your fingertips find those stubborn ridges where boards meet, the faint scallops from clamping pressure, and a little glue squeeze-out that dried just shy of invisible. You know an orbital sander will be slow going, and a planer is off-limits for end grain. So you reach for the belt sander, a few fresh sanding belts in the drawer, and the promise that—done right—you can level and refine this surface without a drum sander, without chatter, and without rounding the edges you worked so hard to square.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/15.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/25/edge-and-end-grain-with-belt-sander-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/edge-and-end-grain-with-belt-sander-sanding-belts.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/25/edge-and-end-grain-with-belt-sander-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/edge-and-end-grain-with-belt-sander-sanding-belts.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/25/edge-and-end-grain-with-belt-sander-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/edge-and-end-grain-with-belt-sander-sanding-belts.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/25/edge-and-end-grain-with-belt-sander-sanding-belts/cards/instagram/edge-and-end-grain-with-belt-sander-sanding-belts.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/25/edge-and-end-grain-with-belt-sander-sanding-belts/cards/instagram/edge-and-end-grain-with-belt-sander-sanding-belts.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/25/edge-and-end-grain-with-belt-sander-sanding-belts/cards/instagram/edge-and-end-grain-with-belt-sander-sanding-belts.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/25/edge-and-end-grain-with-belt-sander-sanding-belts/cards/pinterest/edge-and-end-grain-with-belt-sander-sanding-belts.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/25/edge-and-end-grain-with-belt-sander-sanding-belts/cards/pinterest/edge-and-end-grain-with-belt-sander-sanding-belts.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/25/edge-and-end-grain-with-belt-sander-sanding-belts/cards/pinterest/edge-and-end-grain-with-belt-sander-sanding-belts.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/25/edge-and-end-grain-with-belt-sander-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/edge-and-end-grain-with-belt-sander-sanding-belts.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/25/edge-and-end-grain-with-belt-sander-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/edge-and-end-grain-with-belt-sander-sanding-belts.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/25/edge-and-end-grain-with-belt-sander-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/edge-and-end-grain-with-belt-sander-sanding-belts.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Prepare Curved Parts With Detail Sander</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/24/prepare-curved-parts-with-detail-sander-detail-sander-sheets/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/24/prepare-curved-parts-with-detail-sander-detail-sander-sheets/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 14:16:53 +0000</pubDate><category>Detail Sander Sheets</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-220</category><category>orbital sander</category><description>Pro tips for preparing curved parts with a detail sander: select the right detail sander sheets, manage pressure, and build a repeatable sanding workflow.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="detail-sander-sheets-for-curved-surface-prep"&gt;Detail Sander Sheets for Curved Surface Prep&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rebuilding an heirloom chair rail or smoothing a guitar’s carved heel starts long before the finish can shine. It begins with how you approach the curve itself—its changing grain direction, tight radii, and vulnerable edges. If you reach for a detail sander without a plan, you’ll trade crisp profiles for flats and create scratch patterns that telegraph through stain or lacquer. With the right detail sander sheets, a stable workflow, and control over pressure and pad compliance, you can tune a surface that’s both geometrically faithful and finish-ready. The small triangular pad can be a scalpel or a chisel; your choices of abrasive mineral, grit sequence, and interface layer decide which it becomes. And on curves, those choices matter more than on any flat panel.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/09.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/24/prepare-curved-parts-with-detail-sander-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/prepare-curved-parts-with-detail-sander-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/24/prepare-curved-parts-with-detail-sander-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/prepare-curved-parts-with-detail-sander-detail-sander-sheets.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/24/prepare-curved-parts-with-detail-sander-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/prepare-curved-parts-with-detail-sander-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/24/prepare-curved-parts-with-detail-sander-detail-sander-sheets/cards/instagram/prepare-curved-parts-with-detail-sander-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/24/prepare-curved-parts-with-detail-sander-detail-sander-sheets/cards/instagram/prepare-curved-parts-with-detail-sander-detail-sander-sheets.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/24/prepare-curved-parts-with-detail-sander-detail-sander-sheets/cards/instagram/prepare-curved-parts-with-detail-sander-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/24/prepare-curved-parts-with-detail-sander-detail-sander-sheets/cards/pinterest/prepare-curved-parts-with-detail-sander-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/24/prepare-curved-parts-with-detail-sander-detail-sander-sheets/cards/pinterest/prepare-curved-parts-with-detail-sander-detail-sander-sheets.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/24/prepare-curved-parts-with-detail-sander-detail-sander-sheets/cards/pinterest/prepare-curved-parts-with-detail-sander-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/24/prepare-curved-parts-with-detail-sander-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/prepare-curved-parts-with-detail-sander-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/24/prepare-curved-parts-with-detail-sander-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/prepare-curved-parts-with-detail-sander-detail-sander-sheets.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/24/prepare-curved-parts-with-detail-sander-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/prepare-curved-parts-with-detail-sander-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Repeatability Across Batches And Lots</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/17/repeatability-across-batches-and-lots-abrasive-testing/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/17/repeatability-across-batches-and-lots-abrasive-testing/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 16:02:46 +0000</pubDate><category>Abrasive Innovation &amp; Testing</category><category>grit-320</category><category>orbital sander</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Learn hands-on abrasive testing methods to achieve repeatable results across batches and lots, with shop-ready QC workflows, tools, and troubleshooting.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="abrasive-testing-for-repeatable-results-across-lots"&gt;Abrasive Testing for Repeatable Results Across Lots&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still remember the day a fresh box of sanding discs nearly derailed a deadline. Same grit, same vendor label, same color code—and yet my orbital sander carved a different scratch pattern, left a hazy swirl on walnut panels, and loaded up twice as fast as last week’s batch. I could feel the disc skating instead of cutting, hear the change in pitch, watch dust clump where it should have floated. If you’ve been in a shop long enough—wood, metal, composites, or protective coatings—you’ve met this ghost. It sneaks in through different lots and batches, and it turns your dialed-in process into guesswork right when clients expect consistency.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/10.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/17/repeatability-across-batches-and-lots-abrasive-testing/cards/facebook/repeatability-across-batches-and-lots-abrasive-testing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/17/repeatability-across-batches-and-lots-abrasive-testing/cards/facebook/repeatability-across-batches-and-lots-abrasive-testing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/17/repeatability-across-batches-and-lots-abrasive-testing/cards/facebook/repeatability-across-batches-and-lots-abrasive-testing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/17/repeatability-across-batches-and-lots-abrasive-testing/cards/instagram/repeatability-across-batches-and-lots-abrasive-testing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/17/repeatability-across-batches-and-lots-abrasive-testing/cards/instagram/repeatability-across-batches-and-lots-abrasive-testing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/17/repeatability-across-batches-and-lots-abrasive-testing/cards/instagram/repeatability-across-batches-and-lots-abrasive-testing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/17/repeatability-across-batches-and-lots-abrasive-testing/cards/pinterest/repeatability-across-batches-and-lots-abrasive-testing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/17/repeatability-across-batches-and-lots-abrasive-testing/cards/pinterest/repeatability-across-batches-and-lots-abrasive-testing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/17/repeatability-across-batches-and-lots-abrasive-testing/cards/pinterest/repeatability-across-batches-and-lots-abrasive-testing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/17/repeatability-across-batches-and-lots-abrasive-testing/cards/facebook/repeatability-across-batches-and-lots-abrasive-testing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/17/repeatability-across-batches-and-lots-abrasive-testing/cards/facebook/repeatability-across-batches-and-lots-abrasive-testing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/17/repeatability-across-batches-and-lots-abrasive-testing/cards/facebook/repeatability-across-batches-and-lots-abrasive-testing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Vacuum Hole Alignment By Brand Systems</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/15/vacuum-hole-alignment-by-brand-systems-best-sandpaper-brand/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/15/vacuum-hole-alignment-by-brand-systems-best-sandpaper-brand/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 15 Feb 2026 16:37:33 +0000</pubDate><category>Brand &amp; Quality Comparison</category><category>grit-150</category><category>clear coat</category><category>orbital sander</category><category>dust control</category><description>Learn how to match discs and pads, boost dust extraction, and pick the best sandpaper brand for your sander.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="best-sandpaper-brand-for-vacuum-hole-alignment"&gt;Best Sandpaper Brand for Vacuum Hole Alignment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Late on a Saturday, you finally commit to smoothing that tabletop you’ve been promising yourself you’d refinish. The grain rises under your fingertips; you set the sander on its edge and align a fresh disc. The shop vac hums, the sander spins up—and within seconds, a pale cloud lifts like fog at sunrise. Dust settles on your sleeves, then on the project itself. You pause, puzzled. The vac is on. The disc is new. But when you pop the pad off the workpiece, you notice what your lungs already knew: the holes in the paper don’t match the holes in the pad. Most of the dust extraction ports are blocked. Air is routed the wrong way, and instead of efficient capture, you’re sanding in a haze.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/04.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/15/vacuum-hole-alignment-by-brand-systems-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/facebook/vacuum-hole-alignment-by-brand-systems-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/15/vacuum-hole-alignment-by-brand-systems-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/facebook/vacuum-hole-alignment-by-brand-systems-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/15/vacuum-hole-alignment-by-brand-systems-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/facebook/vacuum-hole-alignment-by-brand-systems-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/15/vacuum-hole-alignment-by-brand-systems-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/instagram/vacuum-hole-alignment-by-brand-systems-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/15/vacuum-hole-alignment-by-brand-systems-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/instagram/vacuum-hole-alignment-by-brand-systems-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/15/vacuum-hole-alignment-by-brand-systems-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/instagram/vacuum-hole-alignment-by-brand-systems-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/15/vacuum-hole-alignment-by-brand-systems-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/pinterest/vacuum-hole-alignment-by-brand-systems-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/15/vacuum-hole-alignment-by-brand-systems-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/pinterest/vacuum-hole-alignment-by-brand-systems-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/15/vacuum-hole-alignment-by-brand-systems-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/pinterest/vacuum-hole-alignment-by-brand-systems-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/15/vacuum-hole-alignment-by-brand-systems-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/facebook/vacuum-hole-alignment-by-brand-systems-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/15/vacuum-hole-alignment-by-brand-systems-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/facebook/vacuum-hole-alignment-by-brand-systems-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/15/vacuum-hole-alignment-by-brand-systems-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/facebook/vacuum-hole-alignment-by-brand-systems-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>How Many Passes Per Grit Are Needed</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/10/how-many-passes-per-grit-are-needed-sandpaper-grit-chart/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/10/how-many-passes-per-grit-are-needed-sandpaper-grit-chart/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 15:57:38 +0000</pubDate><category>Grit Guide &amp; Education</category><category>grit chart</category><category>abrasive standards</category><category>grit progression</category><category>grit-101</category><category>grit-180</category><category>orbital sander</category><category>paint prep</category><description>A practical guide to passes per grit.

&lt;p&gt;Saturday light spills across your workbench. The project in front of you—maybe a scuffed oak dresser, maybe the living room floor you’ve promised to refinish—feels like a promise and a puzzle. You run your hand across the surface and feel the story it tells: tiny ridges, old finish, shallow dents. You’ve got fresh sheets of paper and a plan—start coarse and move finer—but an uncomfortable doubt hovers: how many passes per grit will it take to make this right? You glance at a sandpaper grit chart taped to the wall, and it helps you choose what’s next. Still, charts don’t tell you how many times to cover the board, how slowly to move, when to stop at a grit or when to do “just one more pass.”&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/09.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/10/how-many-passes-per-grit-are-needed-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/how-many-passes-per-grit-are-needed-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/10/how-many-passes-per-grit-are-needed-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/how-many-passes-per-grit-are-needed-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/10/how-many-passes-per-grit-are-needed-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/how-many-passes-per-grit-are-needed-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/10/how-many-passes-per-grit-are-needed-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/instagram/how-many-passes-per-grit-are-needed-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/10/how-many-passes-per-grit-are-needed-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/instagram/how-many-passes-per-grit-are-needed-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/10/how-many-passes-per-grit-are-needed-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/instagram/how-many-passes-per-grit-are-needed-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/10/how-many-passes-per-grit-are-needed-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/pinterest/how-many-passes-per-grit-are-needed-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/10/how-many-passes-per-grit-are-needed-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/pinterest/how-many-passes-per-grit-are-needed-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/10/how-many-passes-per-grit-are-needed-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/pinterest/how-many-passes-per-grit-are-needed-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/10/how-many-passes-per-grit-are-needed-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/how-many-passes-per-grit-are-needed-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/10/how-many-passes-per-grit-are-needed-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/how-many-passes-per-grit-are-needed-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/10/how-many-passes-per-grit-are-needed-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/how-many-passes-per-grit-are-needed-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Replace Discs Safely During Operation</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/09/replace-discs-safely-during-operation-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/09/replace-discs-safely-during-operation-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 14:22:02 +0000</pubDate><category>Hook-and-Loop Discs</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit progression</category><category>orbital sander</category><category>dust control</category><description>Learn how to change hook and loop sanding discs safely mid-project—avoid slips, protect your pad, and get cleaner, faster results with every grit.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="safe-swaps-for-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs"&gt;Safe Swaps for Hook and Loop Sanding Discs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hum of the sander is oddly soothing until the disc starts to chatter and the finish turns patchy. You ease off the pressure, glance at the clock, and weigh a familiar trade-off: keep pushing a dull disc or risk a clumsy change that costs both time and surface quality. Maybe you’re refinishing a mid-century dresser you promised your sister, or you’re on the third room of a floor restoration where the deadline has more backbone than the old oak. Either way, the moments you swap abrasives can make or break a project. This is where hook and loop sanding discs quietly earn their keep—quick changes, consistent grip, and fewer interruptions when the job is in full swing.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/01.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/09/replace-discs-safely-during-operation-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/replace-discs-safely-during-operation-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/09/replace-discs-safely-during-operation-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/replace-discs-safely-during-operation-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/09/replace-discs-safely-during-operation-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/replace-discs-safely-during-operation-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/09/replace-discs-safely-during-operation-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/replace-discs-safely-during-operation-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/09/replace-discs-safely-during-operation-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/replace-discs-safely-during-operation-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/09/replace-discs-safely-during-operation-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/replace-discs-safely-during-operation-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/09/replace-discs-safely-during-operation-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/replace-discs-safely-during-operation-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/09/replace-discs-safely-during-operation-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/replace-discs-safely-during-operation-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/09/replace-discs-safely-during-operation-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/replace-discs-safely-during-operation-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/09/replace-discs-safely-during-operation-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/replace-discs-safely-during-operation-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/09/replace-discs-safely-during-operation-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/replace-discs-safely-during-operation-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/09/replace-discs-safely-during-operation-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/replace-discs-safely-during-operation-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Avoid Pigtails In Random Orbital Sanding</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/07/avoid-pigtails-in-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/07/avoid-pigtails-in-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 07 Feb 2026 13:50:46 +0000</pubDate><category>Random Orbital Sanding</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>dry sanding</category><category>orbital sander</category><category>dust control</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Stop swirl marks for good.

&lt;p&gt;It was a quiet Saturday in the shop, the kind of afternoon when the dust hangs still and the coffee goes cold before you realize you didn’t drink it. My client’s walnut tabletop was clamped to trestles, pencil grid sketched across the surface, and I’d just loaded a fresh 180-grit disc. The random orbital sanding routine was muscle memory by now—vac on, cord over the shoulder, sander flat, steady pace. Ten minutes later, I lifted my raking light across the field… and there they were: faint, corkscrew scratches twitching under the beam. Pigtails. The little saboteurs of a proud finish, the marks that show up when you think you’re done.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/20.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/07/avoid-pigtails-in-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/avoid-pigtails-in-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/07/avoid-pigtails-in-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/avoid-pigtails-in-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/07/avoid-pigtails-in-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/avoid-pigtails-in-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/07/avoid-pigtails-in-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/instagram/avoid-pigtails-in-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/07/avoid-pigtails-in-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/instagram/avoid-pigtails-in-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/07/avoid-pigtails-in-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/instagram/avoid-pigtails-in-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/07/avoid-pigtails-in-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/pinterest/avoid-pigtails-in-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/07/avoid-pigtails-in-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/pinterest/avoid-pigtails-in-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/07/avoid-pigtails-in-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/pinterest/avoid-pigtails-in-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/07/avoid-pigtails-in-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/avoid-pigtails-in-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/07/avoid-pigtails-in-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/avoid-pigtails-in-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/07/avoid-pigtails-in-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/avoid-pigtails-in-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>When To Sand Between Coats Of Water-Based Finish</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/06/when-to-sand-between-coats-of-water-based-finish-between-coats-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/06/when-to-sand-between-coats-of-water-based-finish-between-coats-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 14:06:32 +0000</pubDate><category>Between-Coats Sanding</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-2400</category><category>orbital sander</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Learn exactly when and how to do between coats sanding on water-based finishes.

&lt;p&gt;The first time I chased a flawless water-based finish, I watched the light graze across a new maple desk and saw nothing but promise—and dust nibs. Under the shop’s afternoon sun, every tiny speck caught the eye. I had followed the schedule, measured film build, and kept a clean bench. But the finish felt slightly rough, like a fine orange peel. I knew what came next: between coats sanding. The question was not whether to sand, but when—and how—to avoid cutting through those early coats or, worse, clogging the abrasive with half-cured resin.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/16.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/06/when-to-sand-between-coats-of-water-based-finish-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/when-to-sand-between-coats-of-water-based-finish-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/06/when-to-sand-between-coats-of-water-based-finish-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/when-to-sand-between-coats-of-water-based-finish-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/06/when-to-sand-between-coats-of-water-based-finish-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/when-to-sand-between-coats-of-water-based-finish-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/06/when-to-sand-between-coats-of-water-based-finish-between-coats-sanding/cards/instagram/when-to-sand-between-coats-of-water-based-finish-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/06/when-to-sand-between-coats-of-water-based-finish-between-coats-sanding/cards/instagram/when-to-sand-between-coats-of-water-based-finish-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/06/when-to-sand-between-coats-of-water-based-finish-between-coats-sanding/cards/instagram/when-to-sand-between-coats-of-water-based-finish-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/06/when-to-sand-between-coats-of-water-based-finish-between-coats-sanding/cards/pinterest/when-to-sand-between-coats-of-water-based-finish-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/06/when-to-sand-between-coats-of-water-based-finish-between-coats-sanding/cards/pinterest/when-to-sand-between-coats-of-water-based-finish-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/06/when-to-sand-between-coats-of-water-based-finish-between-coats-sanding/cards/pinterest/when-to-sand-between-coats-of-water-based-finish-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/06/when-to-sand-between-coats-of-water-based-finish-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/when-to-sand-between-coats-of-water-based-finish-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/06/when-to-sand-between-coats-of-water-based-finish-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/when-to-sand-between-coats-of-water-based-finish-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/06/when-to-sand-between-coats-of-water-based-finish-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/when-to-sand-between-coats-of-water-based-finish-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Ceramic Belts For Aggressive Stock Removal</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/25/ceramic-belts-for-aggressive-stock-removal-ceramic-sanding-discs/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/25/ceramic-belts-for-aggressive-stock-removal-ceramic-sanding-discs/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 13:38:02 +0000</pubDate><category>Ceramic &amp; Premium Abrasives</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit progression</category><category>orbital sander</category><category>dust control</category><description>Ceramic belts for fast stock removal, plus when ceramic sanding discs outperform.

&lt;p&gt;The shop is quiet in that way only early morning makes possible—dust settled, machines cold, bench light slicing through the dim. The billet you rough cut last night is still blued along the waterjet edge, and there’s a faint scorch on a hardwood panel you’d rather not talk about. You pick up a fresh belt, flick the grinder to life, and feel the familiar rise in pitch as the drive wheel spins up. This is where ceramic belts earn their keep. They chew, not smear. Under controlled pressure, they self-fracture into sharp edges, pushing material off the part instead of heat into it. If you’ve ever stepped from dull aluminum oxide to a modern ceramic belt, you know the feeling—a sudden, almost startling increase in cut. Later, when you pivot to flatten with a sander, ceramic sanding discs provide the same microfracturing advantage, but with dust extraction and a controlled scratch field better suited to broad surfaces.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/26.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/25/ceramic-belts-for-aggressive-stock-removal-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/ceramic-belts-for-aggressive-stock-removal-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/25/ceramic-belts-for-aggressive-stock-removal-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/ceramic-belts-for-aggressive-stock-removal-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/25/ceramic-belts-for-aggressive-stock-removal-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/ceramic-belts-for-aggressive-stock-removal-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/25/ceramic-belts-for-aggressive-stock-removal-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/ceramic-belts-for-aggressive-stock-removal-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/25/ceramic-belts-for-aggressive-stock-removal-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/ceramic-belts-for-aggressive-stock-removal-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/25/ceramic-belts-for-aggressive-stock-removal-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/ceramic-belts-for-aggressive-stock-removal-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/25/ceramic-belts-for-aggressive-stock-removal-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/ceramic-belts-for-aggressive-stock-removal-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/25/ceramic-belts-for-aggressive-stock-removal-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/ceramic-belts-for-aggressive-stock-removal-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/25/ceramic-belts-for-aggressive-stock-removal-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/ceramic-belts-for-aggressive-stock-removal-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/25/ceramic-belts-for-aggressive-stock-removal-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/ceramic-belts-for-aggressive-stock-removal-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/25/ceramic-belts-for-aggressive-stock-removal-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/ceramic-belts-for-aggressive-stock-removal-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/25/ceramic-belts-for-aggressive-stock-removal-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/ceramic-belts-for-aggressive-stock-removal-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Clean And Reuse Detail Sander Pads</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/19/clean-and-reuse-detail-sander-pads-detail-sander-sheets/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/19/clean-and-reuse-detail-sander-pads-detail-sander-sheets/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 13:51:46 +0000</pubDate><category>Detail Sander Sheets</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>dust control</category><category>orbital sander</category><description>Learn how to clean and reuse detail sander pads and sheets for longer life, smoother finishes, and fewer clogs with pro-level, step-by-step techniques.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="how-to-clean-and-reuse-detail-sander-sheets"&gt;How to Clean and Reuse Detail Sander Sheets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a particular kind of silence in the shop when a good surface reveals itself. The sander throttles down, the dust settles, and that old cabinet door you promised to rehab shows a calm, even sheen—no swirl marks, no burn lines, no fuzzy edges. If you’re like me, you chase that feeling. But I also know the annoyance that breaks it: the triangular tip bogs down, the dust extraction falters, and your sheet is caked like a frosted brownie. You peel it off the pad, only to realize you’ve burned through three sheets in twenty minutes. That’s not a win for your time, your finish, or your budget.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/06.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/19/clean-and-reuse-detail-sander-pads-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/clean-and-reuse-detail-sander-pads-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/19/clean-and-reuse-detail-sander-pads-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/clean-and-reuse-detail-sander-pads-detail-sander-sheets.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/19/clean-and-reuse-detail-sander-pads-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/clean-and-reuse-detail-sander-pads-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/19/clean-and-reuse-detail-sander-pads-detail-sander-sheets/cards/instagram/clean-and-reuse-detail-sander-pads-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/19/clean-and-reuse-detail-sander-pads-detail-sander-sheets/cards/instagram/clean-and-reuse-detail-sander-pads-detail-sander-sheets.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/19/clean-and-reuse-detail-sander-pads-detail-sander-sheets/cards/instagram/clean-and-reuse-detail-sander-pads-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/19/clean-and-reuse-detail-sander-pads-detail-sander-sheets/cards/pinterest/clean-and-reuse-detail-sander-pads-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/19/clean-and-reuse-detail-sander-pads-detail-sander-sheets/cards/pinterest/clean-and-reuse-detail-sander-pads-detail-sander-sheets.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/19/clean-and-reuse-detail-sander-pads-detail-sander-sheets/cards/pinterest/clean-and-reuse-detail-sander-pads-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/19/clean-and-reuse-detail-sander-pads-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/clean-and-reuse-detail-sander-pads-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/19/clean-and-reuse-detail-sander-pads-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/clean-and-reuse-detail-sander-pads-detail-sander-sheets.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/19/clean-and-reuse-detail-sander-pads-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/clean-and-reuse-detail-sander-pads-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Identify Raised Nibs Before Sanding</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/17/identify-raised-nibs-before-sanding-between-coats-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/17/identify-raised-nibs-before-sanding-between-coats-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jan 2026 14:58:48 +0000</pubDate><category>Between-Coats Sanding</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>dry sanding</category><category>orbital sander</category><description>Learn to identify raised nibs before sanding between coats for flawless finishes.

&lt;p&gt;You set the brush down and step back. The tabletop glows under the shop lights, a fresh coat catching reflections like still water. Then you see them—tiny flecks interrupting the gloss, little bumps that snag your eye and threaten the silky-smooth finish you pictured. They’re not big flaws, just dust nibs and bits of raised grain, but you know the truth: if you sand them wrong, you’ll chase scratches, burn through edges, or trap grit that will telegraph through every coat after. The difference between good and truly great finishes often comes down to what we do before we reach for sandpaper.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/29.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/17/identify-raised-nibs-before-sanding-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/identify-raised-nibs-before-sanding-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/17/identify-raised-nibs-before-sanding-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/identify-raised-nibs-before-sanding-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/17/identify-raised-nibs-before-sanding-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/identify-raised-nibs-before-sanding-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/17/identify-raised-nibs-before-sanding-between-coats-sanding/cards/instagram/identify-raised-nibs-before-sanding-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/17/identify-raised-nibs-before-sanding-between-coats-sanding/cards/instagram/identify-raised-nibs-before-sanding-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/17/identify-raised-nibs-before-sanding-between-coats-sanding/cards/instagram/identify-raised-nibs-before-sanding-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/17/identify-raised-nibs-before-sanding-between-coats-sanding/cards/pinterest/identify-raised-nibs-before-sanding-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/17/identify-raised-nibs-before-sanding-between-coats-sanding/cards/pinterest/identify-raised-nibs-before-sanding-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/17/identify-raised-nibs-before-sanding-between-coats-sanding/cards/pinterest/identify-raised-nibs-before-sanding-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/17/identify-raised-nibs-before-sanding-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/identify-raised-nibs-before-sanding-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/17/identify-raised-nibs-before-sanding-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/identify-raised-nibs-before-sanding-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/17/identify-raised-nibs-before-sanding-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/identify-raised-nibs-before-sanding-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Sanding Techniques For Curved And Detailed Molding</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/12/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/12/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 13:48:46 +0000</pubDate><category>Trim &amp; Molding Sanding</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>clear coat</category><category>orbital sander</category><category>sanding block</category><description>Learn expert molding sanding techniques for curved and detailed trim.

&lt;p&gt;The afternoon light hit the hallway just right—the kind of slant that makes crisp edges glow and tiny flaws stand out like little shadows. The old crown molding you’d decided to keep (and just refresh) looked less romantic up close: nicks where movers grazed it, soft ridges from past paint jobs, and a few dips where a power sander had been a touch too enthusiastic. You ran a fingertip along the ogee, felt a wave where a clean curve should be, and realized this was not a job for brute force. It was a job for patience and precision. If you’ve tried molding sanding before, you know the paradox: the more you try to fix a profile, the easier it is to flatten it.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/13.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/12/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding/cards/facebook/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/12/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding/cards/facebook/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/12/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding/cards/facebook/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/12/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding/cards/instagram/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/12/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding/cards/instagram/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/12/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding/cards/instagram/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/12/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding/cards/pinterest/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/12/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding/cards/pinterest/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/12/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding/cards/pinterest/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/12/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding/cards/facebook/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/12/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding/cards/facebook/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/12/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding/cards/facebook/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Wet Sanding Plastics To Control Dust</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 15:17:50 +0000</pubDate><category>Plastic &amp; Epoxy Sanding</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-280</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>dust control</category><category>dry sanding</category><category>orbital sander</category><category>sanding block</category><description>Wet-sand plastics without the mess.

&lt;p&gt;You know that moment when you pick up a 3D‑printed part or an acrylic panel and see the tiny ridges, support nubs, and swirl marks catching the light? That’s when I head to the sink or a tray and set up for wet sanding. I’ve spent years making surfaces behave—wood, composites, plastics—and here’s the truth: wet sanding plastics is the calm, controlled path to a finish you can sign your name to. And the best tricks I learned polishing resin pours and doing epoxy sanding apply beautifully here—steady pressure, smart grit climbs, and keeping abrasives clean so they cut instead of smear.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/16.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding/cards/instagram/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding/cards/instagram/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding/cards/instagram/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding/cards/pinterest/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding/cards/pinterest/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding/cards/pinterest/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Use Soft Interface Pad For Curved Areas</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/04/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/04/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jan 2026 13:34:57 +0000</pubDate><category>Waterproof &amp; Wet/Dry Paper</category><category>grit-280</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-1200</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>orbital sander</category><description>Master curved-surface sanding with soft interface pads and wet dry sandpaper.

&lt;p&gt;The first time you chase a flawless finish across a curving fender, a hand-turned wooden bowl, or the bell of an aluminum bike frame, you learn quickly that flat-surface habits don’t translate. On a crown or complex radius, the surface fights back—edges burn through, pressure spikes leave troughs, and scratches creep in from directions you didn’t intend. The instinct is to push harder or switch to a coarser abrasive; the better move is to refine the contact mechanics. This is where a soft interface pad and properly chosen wet dry sandpaper change the game. Together, they transform an unpredictable contour into a controllable contact patch, preserving geometry while delivering consistent cut and uniform scratch.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/12.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/04/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/04/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/04/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/04/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/instagram/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/04/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/instagram/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/04/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/instagram/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/04/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/04/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/04/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/04/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/04/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/04/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Prevent Edge Burn Through With Softer Pads</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/prevent-edge-burn-through-with-softer-pads-sander-interface-pad/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/prevent-edge-burn-through-with-softer-pads-sander-interface-pad/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 15:51:09 +0000</pubDate><category>Interface Pads &amp; Backing Pads</category><category>grit-180</category><category>dry sanding</category><category>orbital sander</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Learn how a sander interface pad and softer foams prevent edge burn-through, smooth curves, and reduce swirl for cleaner, faster finishing.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="sander-interface-pad-stop-edge-burn-through"&gt;Sander Interface Pad: Stop Edge Burn-Through&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a moment in every refinishing project when you hold your breath: that last pass along a fragile edge. Maybe it’s the rounded lip of a vintage table, the chamfer on a cabinet door, or the bead detail on a banister. You’re almost done, the dust looks light, and then—too late—you see it. A pale halo where the finish burned through to bare wood. It’s a small mistake with big consequences: extra patching, uneven stain absorption, and the sinking feeling that you’ve traded progress for rework. If you’ve been there, know this: control is possible, and a simple swap in your setup can save those edges. A sander interface pad gives your sander a softer touch, spreading pressure, hugging contours, and keeping your finish intact where it’s most vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/02.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/prevent-edge-burn-through-with-softer-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/prevent-edge-burn-through-with-softer-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/prevent-edge-burn-through-with-softer-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/prevent-edge-burn-through-with-softer-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/prevent-edge-burn-through-with-softer-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/prevent-edge-burn-through-with-softer-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/prevent-edge-burn-through-with-softer-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/instagram/prevent-edge-burn-through-with-softer-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/prevent-edge-burn-through-with-softer-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/instagram/prevent-edge-burn-through-with-softer-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/prevent-edge-burn-through-with-softer-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/instagram/prevent-edge-burn-through-with-softer-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/prevent-edge-burn-through-with-softer-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/pinterest/prevent-edge-burn-through-with-softer-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/prevent-edge-burn-through-with-softer-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/pinterest/prevent-edge-burn-through-with-softer-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/prevent-edge-burn-through-with-softer-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/pinterest/prevent-edge-burn-through-with-softer-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/prevent-edge-burn-through-with-softer-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/prevent-edge-burn-through-with-softer-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/prevent-edge-burn-through-with-softer-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/prevent-edge-burn-through-with-softer-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/prevent-edge-burn-through-with-softer-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/prevent-edge-burn-through-with-softer-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Cross Sanding Method For Leveling Panels</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 15:55:05 +0000</pubDate><category>Sanding Blocks</category><category>grit-240</category><category>sanding block</category><category>clear coat</category><category>orbital sander</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Learn the cross sanding method for leveling panels.

&lt;p&gt;The first time you chase “flat” across a panel, it sneaks up on you. Early morning, bench light low and raking, coffee cooling by the vise. You sight across a tabletop you’ve glued up—a handsome mix of maple and walnut—certain you nailed the clamps this time. But you feel it before you see it: the slightest rise where two boards meet, a shallow dish near one corner that catches the light like a ripple on a still pond. It’s not bad, but it’s enough to make a finish telegraph every imperfection. You could reach for a random orbital and it would eventually get you there, but it’s like mowing a lawn in circles. There’s a faster, more controlled way to true a surface: cross sanding with a sanding block.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/21.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block/cards/facebook/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block/cards/facebook/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block/cards/facebook/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block/cards/instagram/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block/cards/instagram/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block/cards/instagram/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block/cards/facebook/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block/cards/facebook/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block/cards/facebook/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Proper Hand Pressure And Speed Control</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/proper-hand-pressure-and-speed-control-random-orbital-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/proper-hand-pressure-and-speed-control-random-orbital-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 13:42:18 +0000</pubDate><category>Random Orbital Sanding</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-2100</category><category>orbital sander</category><description>Master hand pressure and speed control for random orbital sanding to boost surface prep quality, abrasive life, and finish consistency.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="random-orbital-sanding-pressure-and-speed-mastery"&gt;Random Orbital Sanding: Pressure and Speed Mastery&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning, shop lights humming, a fresh cup of coffee cooling beside a maple tabletop you’ve been saving for months. You click on the extractor, roll the hose into your elbow, and set the 5&amp;quot; sander on the surface. The pad spins up with that familiar soft whir. You start at the far corner, let the tool’s own weight settle, and begin to track across the grain. Two passes in, you see it: faint pigtails reflecting in the raking light. You aren’t new to sanding; you’re careful with grits, dust removal, and vacuum airflow. But random orbital sanding still has a way of punishing rushed technique. You realize your grip has tightened and your forearm is leaning into the head—too much pressure. The speed dial is still at max from the last adhesive removal task. Heat builds, the abrasive dulls, and the swirl gremlins come to life.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/17.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/proper-hand-pressure-and-speed-control-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/proper-hand-pressure-and-speed-control-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/proper-hand-pressure-and-speed-control-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/proper-hand-pressure-and-speed-control-random-orbital-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/proper-hand-pressure-and-speed-control-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/proper-hand-pressure-and-speed-control-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/proper-hand-pressure-and-speed-control-random-orbital-sanding/cards/instagram/proper-hand-pressure-and-speed-control-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/proper-hand-pressure-and-speed-control-random-orbital-sanding/cards/instagram/proper-hand-pressure-and-speed-control-random-orbital-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/proper-hand-pressure-and-speed-control-random-orbital-sanding/cards/instagram/proper-hand-pressure-and-speed-control-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/proper-hand-pressure-and-speed-control-random-orbital-sanding/cards/pinterest/proper-hand-pressure-and-speed-control-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/proper-hand-pressure-and-speed-control-random-orbital-sanding/cards/pinterest/proper-hand-pressure-and-speed-control-random-orbital-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/proper-hand-pressure-and-speed-control-random-orbital-sanding/cards/pinterest/proper-hand-pressure-and-speed-control-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/proper-hand-pressure-and-speed-control-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/proper-hand-pressure-and-speed-control-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/proper-hand-pressure-and-speed-control-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/proper-hand-pressure-and-speed-control-random-orbital-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/proper-hand-pressure-and-speed-control-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/proper-hand-pressure-and-speed-control-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Da Sander Versus Random Orbital For Bodywork Preparation</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/25/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/25/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 13:37:54 +0000</pubDate><category>Auto Body Sanding</category><category>grit-40</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>orbital sander</category><description>Engineering review of DA vs RO sanding for car bodywork, with test data on removal rates, finish quality, abrasives, and cost to help you prep panels right.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="da-vs-ro-sanding-for-auto-bodywork-prep"&gt;DA vs RO sanding for Auto Bodywork Prep&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a cool Saturday morning, I wheeled a dented fender onto the stand, grabbed coffee, and stared at two sanders: a pneumatic 6-inch “DA” hanging from the air line, and a compact 5-inch corded random orbital sitting on the bench. The car—an aging hatchback—had a blend of bare metal, polyester filler, and feathered edges where clearcoat met primer. This is the exact moment many DIYers and even pros face: DA vs RO sanding for bodywork prep. You’re not choosing a philosophy; you’re choosing a process that affects dust control, scratch depth, shape fidelity, and the time you’ll spend chasing pigtails or re-spraying primer. I’ve felt the allure of the faster-cutting DA when leveling filler, and I’ve also learned the hard way that an aggressive orbit can tunnel through primer on a convex edge in seconds.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/03.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/25/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding/cards/facebook/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/25/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding/cards/facebook/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/25/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding/cards/facebook/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/25/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding/cards/instagram/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/25/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding/cards/instagram/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/25/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding/cards/instagram/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/25/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding/cards/pinterest/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/25/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding/cards/pinterest/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/25/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding/cards/pinterest/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/25/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding/cards/facebook/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/25/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding/cards/facebook/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/25/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding/cards/facebook/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>How To Sand Floors Without Chatter Marks</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/24/how-to-sand-floors-without-chatter-marks-floor-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/24/how-to-sand-floors-without-chatter-marks-floor-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 14:19:37 +0000</pubDate><category>Floor &amp; Deck Sanding</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-360</category><category>orbital sander</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Eliminate chatter marks with a precise floor sanding workflow—machine setup, abrasive sequencing, and surface prep techniques that produce flat, quiet floors.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="floor-sanding-without-chatter-a-pros-workflow"&gt;Floor Sanding Without Chatter: A Pro’s Workflow&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quiet house at sunrise, the kind of silence that makes you notice details. The boards gleam faintly where a rug used to sit, but everywhere else the finish is tired, dull, and scuffed. You roll the big sander off the truck, shoulders relaxed but eyes scanning for risk. This is where floor sanding gets real: the path between “good enough” and “exceptional” is only a few thousandths of an inch wide. Chatter marks—those rhythmic ripples the light will ruthlessly expose—are the difference. Once you see them, you can’t unsee them. And once they’re sealed under finish, they’ll stare back for years.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/01.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/24/how-to-sand-floors-without-chatter-marks-floor-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-floors-without-chatter-marks-floor-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/24/how-to-sand-floors-without-chatter-marks-floor-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-floors-without-chatter-marks-floor-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/24/how-to-sand-floors-without-chatter-marks-floor-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-floors-without-chatter-marks-floor-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/24/how-to-sand-floors-without-chatter-marks-floor-sanding/cards/instagram/how-to-sand-floors-without-chatter-marks-floor-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/24/how-to-sand-floors-without-chatter-marks-floor-sanding/cards/instagram/how-to-sand-floors-without-chatter-marks-floor-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/24/how-to-sand-floors-without-chatter-marks-floor-sanding/cards/instagram/how-to-sand-floors-without-chatter-marks-floor-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/24/how-to-sand-floors-without-chatter-marks-floor-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-to-sand-floors-without-chatter-marks-floor-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/24/how-to-sand-floors-without-chatter-marks-floor-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-to-sand-floors-without-chatter-marks-floor-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/24/how-to-sand-floors-without-chatter-marks-floor-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-to-sand-floors-without-chatter-marks-floor-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/24/how-to-sand-floors-without-chatter-marks-floor-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-floors-without-chatter-marks-floor-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/24/how-to-sand-floors-without-chatter-marks-floor-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-floors-without-chatter-marks-floor-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/24/how-to-sand-floors-without-chatter-marks-floor-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-floors-without-chatter-marks-floor-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Best Sandpaper Grits For Sanding Wood</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/22/best-sandpaper-grits-for-sanding-wood-wood-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/22/best-sandpaper-grits-for-sanding-wood-wood-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 13:40:09 +0000</pubDate><category>Wood sanding</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>orbital sander</category><category>dust control</category><description>Choose the best sandpaper grits for wood sanding.

&lt;p&gt;A Saturday morning sunbeam revealed everything—the faint planer tracks on a maple tabletop, a small divot near an edge, and those whisper-thin swirls you only notice after the first coat of finish. A project that looked “almost ready” under overhead light suddenly felt two steps backward under raking light. That moment is where quality begins: in choosing the right starting grit and a disciplined progression that erases, rather than buries, defects. This is the decisive difference between passable and professional surface prep.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/22.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/22/best-sandpaper-grits-for-sanding-wood-wood-sanding/cards/facebook/best-sandpaper-grits-for-sanding-wood-wood-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/22/best-sandpaper-grits-for-sanding-wood-wood-sanding/cards/facebook/best-sandpaper-grits-for-sanding-wood-wood-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/22/best-sandpaper-grits-for-sanding-wood-wood-sanding/cards/facebook/best-sandpaper-grits-for-sanding-wood-wood-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/22/best-sandpaper-grits-for-sanding-wood-wood-sanding/cards/instagram/best-sandpaper-grits-for-sanding-wood-wood-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/22/best-sandpaper-grits-for-sanding-wood-wood-sanding/cards/instagram/best-sandpaper-grits-for-sanding-wood-wood-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/22/best-sandpaper-grits-for-sanding-wood-wood-sanding/cards/instagram/best-sandpaper-grits-for-sanding-wood-wood-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/22/best-sandpaper-grits-for-sanding-wood-wood-sanding/cards/pinterest/best-sandpaper-grits-for-sanding-wood-wood-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/22/best-sandpaper-grits-for-sanding-wood-wood-sanding/cards/pinterest/best-sandpaper-grits-for-sanding-wood-wood-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/22/best-sandpaper-grits-for-sanding-wood-wood-sanding/cards/pinterest/best-sandpaper-grits-for-sanding-wood-wood-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/22/best-sandpaper-grits-for-sanding-wood-wood-sanding/cards/facebook/best-sandpaper-grits-for-sanding-wood-wood-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/22/best-sandpaper-grits-for-sanding-wood-wood-sanding/cards/facebook/best-sandpaper-grits-for-sanding-wood-wood-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/22/best-sandpaper-grits-for-sanding-wood-wood-sanding/cards/facebook/best-sandpaper-grits-for-sanding-wood-wood-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Multi Density Pad Stacks For Tricky Shapes</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/multi-density-pad-stacks-for-tricky-shapes-sander-interface-pad/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/multi-density-pad-stacks-for-tricky-shapes-sander-interface-pad/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 12 Dec 2025 16:15:21 +0000</pubDate><category>Interface Pads &amp; Backing Pads</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>orbital sander</category><description>Learn how to build multi-density sander interface pad stacks for tricky shapes, with step-by-step setups, pro tips, and real-world sanding techniques.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="multi-density-sander-interface-pad-stacks-for-curves"&gt;Multi-Density Sander Interface Pad Stacks for Curves&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first time you chase a graceful curve with a flat sanding disc, you feel it: that tiny chatter, the scratch that won’t blend out, the edge that suddenly burns through. It’s a lesson every builder learns, whether you’re shaping a guitar heel, blending autobody filler into a wheel arch, or easing a bullnose on oak treads. In my shop, those moments used to slow projects to a crawl—especially when my random orbital insisted on flattening what I needed to caress. Then I started stacking foam like a chef layers flavors: soft for drape, medium for control, thin for crispness. That stack, centered on a sander interface pad, turned my sander into a shape-following tool instead of a shape-fighting one.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/15.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/multi-density-pad-stacks-for-tricky-shapes-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/multi-density-pad-stacks-for-tricky-shapes-sander-interface-pad.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/multi-density-pad-stacks-for-tricky-shapes-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/multi-density-pad-stacks-for-tricky-shapes-sander-interface-pad.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/multi-density-pad-stacks-for-tricky-shapes-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/multi-density-pad-stacks-for-tricky-shapes-sander-interface-pad.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/multi-density-pad-stacks-for-tricky-shapes-sander-interface-pad/cards/instagram/multi-density-pad-stacks-for-tricky-shapes-sander-interface-pad.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/multi-density-pad-stacks-for-tricky-shapes-sander-interface-pad/cards/instagram/multi-density-pad-stacks-for-tricky-shapes-sander-interface-pad.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/multi-density-pad-stacks-for-tricky-shapes-sander-interface-pad/cards/instagram/multi-density-pad-stacks-for-tricky-shapes-sander-interface-pad.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/multi-density-pad-stacks-for-tricky-shapes-sander-interface-pad/cards/pinterest/multi-density-pad-stacks-for-tricky-shapes-sander-interface-pad.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/multi-density-pad-stacks-for-tricky-shapes-sander-interface-pad/cards/pinterest/multi-density-pad-stacks-for-tricky-shapes-sander-interface-pad.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/multi-density-pad-stacks-for-tricky-shapes-sander-interface-pad/cards/pinterest/multi-density-pad-stacks-for-tricky-shapes-sander-interface-pad.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/multi-density-pad-stacks-for-tricky-shapes-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/multi-density-pad-stacks-for-tricky-shapes-sander-interface-pad.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/multi-density-pad-stacks-for-tricky-shapes-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/multi-density-pad-stacks-for-tricky-shapes-sander-interface-pad.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/multi-density-pad-stacks-for-tricky-shapes-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/multi-density-pad-stacks-for-tricky-shapes-sander-interface-pad.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Vacuum Hookup For Dustless Orbital Sanding</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/vacuum-hookup-for-dustless-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/vacuum-hookup-for-dustless-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 10 Dec 2025 15:13:40 +0000</pubDate><category>Random Orbital Sanding</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>dust control</category><category>orbital sander</category><description>Achieve dustless results with smart vacuum hookups for random orbital sanding.

&lt;p&gt;The first time you see true “dustless” sanding, it feels like cheating. The room stays clear, your lungs don’t protest, and the surface looks better with each pass. I remember a Saturday morning in a small basement shop—coffee steaming, maple table top ready, and my playlist queued up—when a familiar dread crept in. I loved building things, but I hated the blizzard of dust that came with it. It wove into sweaters, clung to eyelashes, and added an hour of cleanup to every project. That day, I swapped my old hose for a snug-fitting antistatic one, dialed the vacuum to the sweet spot, and tried random orbital sanding with the vac hooked up. Ten minutes later, I realized I was breathing easier. The snowstorm never came.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/01.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/vacuum-hookup-for-dustless-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/vacuum-hookup-for-dustless-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/vacuum-hookup-for-dustless-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/vacuum-hookup-for-dustless-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/vacuum-hookup-for-dustless-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/vacuum-hookup-for-dustless-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/vacuum-hookup-for-dustless-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/instagram/vacuum-hookup-for-dustless-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/vacuum-hookup-for-dustless-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/instagram/vacuum-hookup-for-dustless-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/vacuum-hookup-for-dustless-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/instagram/vacuum-hookup-for-dustless-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/vacuum-hookup-for-dustless-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/pinterest/vacuum-hookup-for-dustless-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/vacuum-hookup-for-dustless-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/pinterest/vacuum-hookup-for-dustless-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/vacuum-hookup-for-dustless-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/pinterest/vacuum-hookup-for-dustless-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/vacuum-hookup-for-dustless-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/vacuum-hookup-for-dustless-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/vacuum-hookup-for-dustless-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/vacuum-hookup-for-dustless-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/vacuum-hookup-for-dustless-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/vacuum-hookup-for-dustless-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Figure Eight Motion For Pole Sander On Walls</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/figure-eight-motion-for-pole-sander-on-walls-pole-sander-drywall/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/figure-eight-motion-for-pole-sander-on-walls-pole-sander-drywall/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 07 Dec 2025 16:34:58 +0000</pubDate><category>Drywall Sanding</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit progression</category><category>orbital sander</category><category>dust control</category><description>Master the figure‑eight motion for pole sanding drywall.

&lt;p&gt;The first time I learned the figure‑eight, it was 6 a.m., coffee in a paint-stained thermos, and a living room taped up like a crime scene. The house belonged to a neighbor who’d done an earnest DIY skim coat. The seams were proud, ridges crisp as a credit card. I’d already spent too many nights fighting walls with the wrong motion: straight up and down, back and forth, carving tracks with a pole head that liked to dig in at the end of each stroke. If you’ve ever wrestled a pole sander drywall on a long seam, you know that end-of-stroke gouge—the one that laughs at you when the primer hits it.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/12.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/figure-eight-motion-for-pole-sander-on-walls-pole-sander-drywall/cards/facebook/figure-eight-motion-for-pole-sander-on-walls-pole-sander-drywall.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/figure-eight-motion-for-pole-sander-on-walls-pole-sander-drywall/cards/facebook/figure-eight-motion-for-pole-sander-on-walls-pole-sander-drywall.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/figure-eight-motion-for-pole-sander-on-walls-pole-sander-drywall/cards/facebook/figure-eight-motion-for-pole-sander-on-walls-pole-sander-drywall.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/figure-eight-motion-for-pole-sander-on-walls-pole-sander-drywall/cards/instagram/figure-eight-motion-for-pole-sander-on-walls-pole-sander-drywall.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/figure-eight-motion-for-pole-sander-on-walls-pole-sander-drywall/cards/instagram/figure-eight-motion-for-pole-sander-on-walls-pole-sander-drywall.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/figure-eight-motion-for-pole-sander-on-walls-pole-sander-drywall/cards/instagram/figure-eight-motion-for-pole-sander-on-walls-pole-sander-drywall.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/figure-eight-motion-for-pole-sander-on-walls-pole-sander-drywall/cards/pinterest/figure-eight-motion-for-pole-sander-on-walls-pole-sander-drywall.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/figure-eight-motion-for-pole-sander-on-walls-pole-sander-drywall/cards/pinterest/figure-eight-motion-for-pole-sander-on-walls-pole-sander-drywall.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/figure-eight-motion-for-pole-sander-on-walls-pole-sander-drywall/cards/pinterest/figure-eight-motion-for-pole-sander-on-walls-pole-sander-drywall.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/figure-eight-motion-for-pole-sander-on-walls-pole-sander-drywall/cards/facebook/figure-eight-motion-for-pole-sander-on-walls-pole-sander-drywall.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/figure-eight-motion-for-pole-sander-on-walls-pole-sander-drywall/cards/facebook/figure-eight-motion-for-pole-sander-on-walls-pole-sander-drywall.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/figure-eight-motion-for-pole-sander-on-walls-pole-sander-drywall/cards/facebook/figure-eight-motion-for-pole-sander-on-walls-pole-sander-drywall.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>What Grit To Sand Furniture Before Applying Stain</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 07 Dec 2025 13:31:13 +0000</pubDate><category>Furniture Refinishing</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-800</category><category>orbital sander</category><category>sanding block</category><category>dust control</category><description>Learn the exact sanding grits, workflows, and checks that drive even stain color and professional results on furniture projects.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="stain-preparation-what-grit-to-sand-furniture"&gt;Stain Preparation: What Grit to Sand Furniture&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a quiet Saturday morning, you clear the dining table and pull the tarp tight. The surface is a patchwork of rings, scratches, and a few mystery stains from a previous life—nothing that an orbital sander and a little patience can’t fix. The smell of sawdust arrives quickly, and with it a deceptively simple choice: what grit to sand furniture before applying stain. There are plenty of opinions, but only one proper sequence for your species, stain type, and condition of the substrate. That decision—more than the brand of stain or even your brushing technique—will decide whether the grain pops evenly or blotches, whether the edges stay crisp or burn through, and whether your topcoat glides over a consistent scratch pattern or amplifies every swirl mark. Done right, stain preparation becomes a repeatable, almost meditative routine that pays off with reliable, beautiful finishes.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/08.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation/cards/facebook/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation/cards/facebook/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation/cards/facebook/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation/cards/instagram/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation/cards/instagram/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation/cards/instagram/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation/cards/pinterest/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation/cards/pinterest/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation/cards/pinterest/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation/cards/facebook/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation/cards/facebook/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation/cards/facebook/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Avoid Rounding Edges During Detail Sanding</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/avoid-rounding-edges-during-detail-sanding-detail-sander-sheets/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/avoid-rounding-edges-during-detail-sanding-detail-sander-sheets/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 13:39:01 +0000</pubDate><category>Detail Sander Sheets</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>dust control</category><category>orbital sander</category><category>sanding block</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Keep edges crisp: pro techniques, sheet choices, and workflows to avoid rounding during detail sanding with precision abrasive control.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="how-to-avoid-rounding-edges-with-detail-sander-sheets"&gt;How to Avoid Rounding Edges with Detail Sander Sheets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A crisp edge is honesty you can feel. You run a fingertip along the rail of a cabinet door or the rim of a keepsake box and know immediately whether the prep was careful or hurried. The line should be true—straight, sharp, and confident—not washed out by a power sander that wobbled a hair too long at the corner. The irony is familiar: we reach for a small triangular sander to finesse tight spaces, then watch it soften what we wanted to preserve. If you’ve ever started a job with a fresh pack of detail sander sheets, only to end it with unintentionally eased profiles, this guide is for you.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/18.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/avoid-rounding-edges-during-detail-sanding-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/avoid-rounding-edges-during-detail-sanding-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/avoid-rounding-edges-during-detail-sanding-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/avoid-rounding-edges-during-detail-sanding-detail-sander-sheets.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/avoid-rounding-edges-during-detail-sanding-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/avoid-rounding-edges-during-detail-sanding-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/avoid-rounding-edges-during-detail-sanding-detail-sander-sheets/cards/instagram/avoid-rounding-edges-during-detail-sanding-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/avoid-rounding-edges-during-detail-sanding-detail-sander-sheets/cards/instagram/avoid-rounding-edges-during-detail-sanding-detail-sander-sheets.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/avoid-rounding-edges-during-detail-sanding-detail-sander-sheets/cards/instagram/avoid-rounding-edges-during-detail-sanding-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/avoid-rounding-edges-during-detail-sanding-detail-sander-sheets/cards/pinterest/avoid-rounding-edges-during-detail-sanding-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/avoid-rounding-edges-during-detail-sanding-detail-sander-sheets/cards/pinterest/avoid-rounding-edges-during-detail-sanding-detail-sander-sheets.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/avoid-rounding-edges-during-detail-sanding-detail-sander-sheets/cards/pinterest/avoid-rounding-edges-during-detail-sanding-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/avoid-rounding-edges-during-detail-sanding-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/avoid-rounding-edges-during-detail-sanding-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/avoid-rounding-edges-during-detail-sanding-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/avoid-rounding-edges-during-detail-sanding-detail-sander-sheets.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/avoid-rounding-edges-during-detail-sanding-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/avoid-rounding-edges-during-detail-sanding-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>When To Choose Chemical Stripping Instead Of Sanding</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 13:38:25 +0000</pubDate><category>Paint Removal &amp; Surface Prep</category><category>paint prep</category><category>rust removal</category><category>primer coat</category><category>sanding block</category><category>orbital sander</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Learn when chemical stripping beats sanding.

&lt;p&gt;You can hear a project before you see it: the whine of an orbital sander, the hiss of a dust extractor, the rasp of grit carving tracks in an old finish. The other soundtrack is a quiet shop, drop cloths taped down, a gelled stripper turning tired paint into ribbons under a plastic scraper. Both are valid approaches to surface preparation, and the results hinge on choosing the right path at the outset. The paint stripping vs sanding decision is less about preference and more about material science, coating behavior, and the downstream finish you expect. If you’re staring at a five-layer porch rail, a veneered dresser, or a fiberglass hatch, the fastest route to a clean, profile-ready surface may not be the one you think.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/10.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding/cards/instagram/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding/cards/instagram/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding/cards/instagram/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding/cards/pinterest/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding/cards/pinterest/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding/cards/pinterest/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>How To Use A Drum Sander Without Gouging The Floor</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/how-to-use-a-drum-sander-without-gouging-the-floor-drum-sander/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/how-to-use-a-drum-sander-without-gouging-the-floor-drum-sander/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 22 Nov 2025 00:17:02 +0000</pubDate><category>Floor &amp; Deck Sanding</category><category>grit-40</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>dust control</category><category>dry sanding</category><category>orbital sander</category><description>Learn how to use a drum sander safely and smoothly to refinish hardwood floors without gouges, from setup and technique to edges, dust, and final prep.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="how-to-use-a-drum-sander-without-gouging-floors"&gt;How to Use a Drum Sander Without Gouging Floors&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a specific quiet that fills the house once the furniture is moved and the rugs are rolled away. You stand in that new emptiness and see every scuff and dent that daily life has pressed into your hardwood—sun-faded planks by the windows, chair-leg tracks under the table, and a dark, worn path that arcs toward the kitchen. Maybe you’ve watched a few videos and read some forum threads, and now the rental center’s phone number is staring you down. The idea of a sparkling new finish is thrilling. The idea of gouging the floor with a poorly handled drum sander? Not so much.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/29.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/how-to-use-a-drum-sander-without-gouging-the-floor-drum-sander/cards/facebook/how-to-use-a-drum-sander-without-gouging-the-floor-drum-sander.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/how-to-use-a-drum-sander-without-gouging-the-floor-drum-sander/cards/facebook/how-to-use-a-drum-sander-without-gouging-the-floor-drum-sander.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/how-to-use-a-drum-sander-without-gouging-the-floor-drum-sander/cards/facebook/how-to-use-a-drum-sander-without-gouging-the-floor-drum-sander.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/how-to-use-a-drum-sander-without-gouging-the-floor-drum-sander/cards/instagram/how-to-use-a-drum-sander-without-gouging-the-floor-drum-sander.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/how-to-use-a-drum-sander-without-gouging-the-floor-drum-sander/cards/instagram/how-to-use-a-drum-sander-without-gouging-the-floor-drum-sander.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/how-to-use-a-drum-sander-without-gouging-the-floor-drum-sander/cards/instagram/how-to-use-a-drum-sander-without-gouging-the-floor-drum-sander.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/how-to-use-a-drum-sander-without-gouging-the-floor-drum-sander/cards/pinterest/how-to-use-a-drum-sander-without-gouging-the-floor-drum-sander.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/how-to-use-a-drum-sander-without-gouging-the-floor-drum-sander/cards/pinterest/how-to-use-a-drum-sander-without-gouging-the-floor-drum-sander.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/how-to-use-a-drum-sander-without-gouging-the-floor-drum-sander/cards/pinterest/how-to-use-a-drum-sander-without-gouging-the-floor-drum-sander.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/how-to-use-a-drum-sander-without-gouging-the-floor-drum-sander/cards/facebook/how-to-use-a-drum-sander-without-gouging-the-floor-drum-sander.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/how-to-use-a-drum-sander-without-gouging-the-floor-drum-sander/cards/facebook/how-to-use-a-drum-sander-without-gouging-the-floor-drum-sander.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/how-to-use-a-drum-sander-without-gouging-the-floor-drum-sander/cards/facebook/how-to-use-a-drum-sander-without-gouging-the-floor-drum-sander.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>13</readingTime></item><item><title>How To Apply Grain Filler On Open Pore Woods Like Oak</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 21 Nov 2025 13:33:23 +0000</pubDate><category>Furniture Refinishing</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>orbital sander</category><description>Learn precise grain filling for oak: abrasives, sanding workflow, filler selection, and application to achieve a glass-smooth finish on open-pore woods.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="grain-filling-oak-pro-sanding-and-filler-workflow"&gt;Grain Filling Oak: Pro Sanding and Filler Workflow&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a moment every woodworker recognizes: fingertips tracing a new oak tabletop, catching on the earlywood valleys that step across the surface like tiny terraces. Under shop lights, the finish looks glossy, almost perfect—until the raking light at sunrise reveals a topography of pores telegraphing through the film. That’s when grain filling stops being a nice-to-have and becomes a requirement. On open-pore woods like oak, ash, and mahogany, achieving a piano-flat finish asks for a deliberate sequence: correct abrasive selection, controlled scratch management, filler chemistry that matches your topcoat, and disciplined leveling. Skip any step and the pores will betray your shortcuts weeks later.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/23.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling/cards/facebook/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling/cards/facebook/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling/cards/facebook/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling/cards/instagram/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling/cards/instagram/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling/cards/instagram/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling/cards/pinterest/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling/cards/pinterest/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling/cards/pinterest/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling/cards/facebook/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling/cards/facebook/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling/cards/facebook/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Paper Weight And Flexibility Differences</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/paper-weight-and-flexibility-differences-open-coat-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/paper-weight-and-flexibility-differences-open-coat-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2025 05:56:56 +0000</pubDate><category>Backing Types &amp; Coatings</category><category>grit-150</category><category>orbital sander</category><category>sanding block</category><category>grit progression</category><category>wet sanding</category><description>Understand paper weight, flexibility, and when to use open coat sandpaper for cleaner cuts, fewer clogs, and pro-grade finishes in wood and metalwork.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="open-coat-sandpaper-paper-weight-and-flexibility"&gt;Open Coat Sandpaper, Paper Weight, and Flexibility&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning, mug of coffee steaming on the bench. The shop is still cool, and the only sound is your block plane sliding across a maple board. You’re smoothing a reclaimed slab into a dining table that has to look heirloom, not “weekend project.” You switch to abrasive work—this is where most projects are won or lost. Pull a sheet from the drawer and you can tell instantly: too stiff and it will flatten the gentle chamfer you’ve planed; too flimsy and it will telegraph every ridge from your fingertips. You also know the species: maple burns if you let a clogged sheet skate across it. That’s where choice matters—paper weight, flexibility, and whether open coat sandpaper will let the dust clear instead of loading the sheet like wet snow on a shovel.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/11.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/paper-weight-and-flexibility-differences-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/paper-weight-and-flexibility-differences-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/paper-weight-and-flexibility-differences-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/paper-weight-and-flexibility-differences-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/paper-weight-and-flexibility-differences-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/paper-weight-and-flexibility-differences-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/paper-weight-and-flexibility-differences-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/instagram/paper-weight-and-flexibility-differences-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/paper-weight-and-flexibility-differences-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/instagram/paper-weight-and-flexibility-differences-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/paper-weight-and-flexibility-differences-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/instagram/paper-weight-and-flexibility-differences-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/paper-weight-and-flexibility-differences-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/paper-weight-and-flexibility-differences-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/paper-weight-and-flexibility-differences-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/paper-weight-and-flexibility-differences-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/paper-weight-and-flexibility-differences-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/paper-weight-and-flexibility-differences-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/paper-weight-and-flexibility-differences-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/paper-weight-and-flexibility-differences-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/paper-weight-and-flexibility-differences-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/paper-weight-and-flexibility-differences-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/paper-weight-and-flexibility-differences-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/paper-weight-and-flexibility-differences-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Cut Rate And Loading Behavior By Grain</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2025 00:57:05 +0000</pubDate><category>Abrasive Materials &amp; Compounds</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>clear coat</category><category>orbital sander</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>Engineer’s guide to silicon carbide sandpaper—cut rate, loading, grain physics, and practical tips to choose the right abrasive for paint, metal, and</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="silicon-carbide-sandpaper-cut-rate-and-loading"&gt;Silicon Carbide Sandpaper: Cut Rate and Loading&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning in the garage, the air smelled faintly of cut clear coat and soapy water. A half-finished motorcycle tank sat on a foam cradle, its orange peel and dust nibs highlighted by a raking LED panel. I’d already tried a few sheets of 1500 grit from a contractor pack, but they stalled after a few passes, loading with milky slurry and leaving stray scratches that would require more polish later. This is the moment that separates a casual sand from a dependable workflow—the point where abrasive choice dictates not just speed, but consistency and finish quality. Swapping to silicon carbide sandpaper felt like a small change, but it reset the process: faster leveling, more controllable scratch patterns, and fewer surprise defects.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/09.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/instagram/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/instagram/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/instagram/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Grit Selection For Antifouling Paint Prep</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2025 14:20:36 +0000</pubDate><category>Marine Sanding</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-70</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-280</category><category>dust control</category><category>paint prep</category><category>orbital sander</category><description>Learn how to choose the right sanding grits for antifouling prep.

&lt;p&gt;You feel it as soon as the travel lift sets your boat on the stands: that mix of relief and responsibility. The hull looks taller on land, the waterline a faint stain of the season gone by. There’s a quiet rhythm to the boatyard in the early hours—compressors breathe, gulls trade commentary, coffee cools beside a bucket of scrapers. You run your hand over the bottom paint and feel the story of boat sanding before you even begin: the hard, glossy ridges where the sander skipped, the chalky patches that might be underbound, the thin spots the sea worked harder than you realized. It’s tempting to rush the job and get straight to brushing on antifouling. But prep is where the next season is won. Choosing the right grit is the difference between a coat that stays put and one that blisters, powders, or peels when the boat is back in her element.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/05.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding/cards/instagram/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding/cards/instagram/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding/cards/instagram/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding/cards/pinterest/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding/cards/pinterest/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding/cards/pinterest/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Multi Hole Discs Improve Airflow And Cut</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/multi-hole-discs-improve-airflow-and-cut-dustless-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/multi-hole-discs-improve-airflow-and-cut-dustless-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 15 Nov 2025 14:04:48 +0000</pubDate><category>Dust Extraction Systems</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-180</category><category>joint compound</category><category>orbital sander</category><description>Learn how multi-hole discs boost airflow, cut rate, and surface finish while keeping dustless sanding clean and precise in wood, auto, and drywall jobs.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="dustless-sanding-multi-hole-discs-that-cut-faster"&gt;Dustless sanding: multi-hole discs that cut faster&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a Saturday morning in the shop, the light comes in as a hazy beam. You flip on the sander, nudge it onto an oak tabletop, and within seconds the air looks like a snow globe gone rogue. Your safety glasses fog, your shirt turns gray, and the shop vac whines like it’s doing something—but the dust still settles on every flat surface you own. I’ve been there. I’ve also watched the other version of this scene: the pad spins, dust disappears, the workpiece stays cool, and the abrasive keeps biting for pass after pass. The difference isn’t magic—it&amp;rsquo;s airflow. Specifically, the way a multi-hole disc and a properly set vacuum system handle air and debris to deliver real dustless sanding without killing your cut rate.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/16.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/multi-hole-discs-improve-airflow-and-cut-dustless-sanding/cards/facebook/multi-hole-discs-improve-airflow-and-cut-dustless-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/multi-hole-discs-improve-airflow-and-cut-dustless-sanding/cards/facebook/multi-hole-discs-improve-airflow-and-cut-dustless-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/multi-hole-discs-improve-airflow-and-cut-dustless-sanding/cards/facebook/multi-hole-discs-improve-airflow-and-cut-dustless-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/multi-hole-discs-improve-airflow-and-cut-dustless-sanding/cards/instagram/multi-hole-discs-improve-airflow-and-cut-dustless-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/multi-hole-discs-improve-airflow-and-cut-dustless-sanding/cards/instagram/multi-hole-discs-improve-airflow-and-cut-dustless-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/multi-hole-discs-improve-airflow-and-cut-dustless-sanding/cards/instagram/multi-hole-discs-improve-airflow-and-cut-dustless-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/multi-hole-discs-improve-airflow-and-cut-dustless-sanding/cards/pinterest/multi-hole-discs-improve-airflow-and-cut-dustless-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/multi-hole-discs-improve-airflow-and-cut-dustless-sanding/cards/pinterest/multi-hole-discs-improve-airflow-and-cut-dustless-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/multi-hole-discs-improve-airflow-and-cut-dustless-sanding/cards/pinterest/multi-hole-discs-improve-airflow-and-cut-dustless-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/multi-hole-discs-improve-airflow-and-cut-dustless-sanding/cards/facebook/multi-hole-discs-improve-airflow-and-cut-dustless-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/multi-hole-discs-improve-airflow-and-cut-dustless-sanding/cards/facebook/multi-hole-discs-improve-airflow-and-cut-dustless-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/multi-hole-discs-improve-airflow-and-cut-dustless-sanding/cards/facebook/multi-hole-discs-improve-airflow-and-cut-dustless-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Select Correct Orbit Size For Performance</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/select-correct-orbit-size-for-performance-random-orbital-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/select-correct-orbit-size-for-performance-random-orbital-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 18:01:30 +0000</pubDate><category>Random Orbital Sanding</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>clear coat</category><category>orbital sander</category><description>Learn how to pick the right orbit size for random orbital sanding to boost speed, control, and surface quality, with pro tips, setups, and troubleshooting.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="random-orbital-sanding-choose-the-right-orbit-size"&gt;Random Orbital Sanding: Choose the Right Orbit Size&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s early, coffee is hot, and the workshop has that quiet hum before saws and vacs kick off. On the bench sits a maple tabletop you’ve been coaxing toward a flawless finish all week. You line up abrasives, check the vacuum hose, and reach for your sander—then pause. The sticker says 5 mm orbit, but you’ve also got a 2.5 mm model in the drawer. Which one delivers the fastest path to dead‑flat without leaving those annoying pigtails under a clear coat? This is where random orbital sanding really becomes a craft decision, not just a tool choice. Orbit size is the lever that moves your workflow. Choose it well, and you remove stock quickly, steer around swirl risks, and hit finish-quality scratch patterns faster. Choose it poorly, and you burn time, clog discs, and inherit defects you can only fix by stepping back several grits.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/29.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/select-correct-orbit-size-for-performance-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/select-correct-orbit-size-for-performance-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/select-correct-orbit-size-for-performance-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/select-correct-orbit-size-for-performance-random-orbital-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/select-correct-orbit-size-for-performance-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/select-correct-orbit-size-for-performance-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/select-correct-orbit-size-for-performance-random-orbital-sanding/cards/instagram/select-correct-orbit-size-for-performance-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/select-correct-orbit-size-for-performance-random-orbital-sanding/cards/instagram/select-correct-orbit-size-for-performance-random-orbital-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/select-correct-orbit-size-for-performance-random-orbital-sanding/cards/instagram/select-correct-orbit-size-for-performance-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/select-correct-orbit-size-for-performance-random-orbital-sanding/cards/pinterest/select-correct-orbit-size-for-performance-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/select-correct-orbit-size-for-performance-random-orbital-sanding/cards/pinterest/select-correct-orbit-size-for-performance-random-orbital-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/select-correct-orbit-size-for-performance-random-orbital-sanding/cards/pinterest/select-correct-orbit-size-for-performance-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/select-correct-orbit-size-for-performance-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/select-correct-orbit-size-for-performance-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/select-correct-orbit-size-for-performance-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/select-correct-orbit-size-for-performance-random-orbital-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/select-correct-orbit-size-for-performance-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/select-correct-orbit-size-for-performance-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>How To Remove Polyurethane Or Varnish Safely From Furniture</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-remove-polyurethane-or-varnish-safely-from-furniture-wood-finish-removal/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-remove-polyurethane-or-varnish-safely-from-furniture-wood-finish-removal/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2025 18:54:49 +0000</pubDate><category>Furniture Refinishing</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit progression</category><category>orbital sander</category><description>Learn safe, practical wood finish removal for furniture—strip polyurethane or varnish without damage.

&lt;p&gt;It starts as a quiet, hopeful Saturday morning. You slide open a drawer on a hand-me-down dresser and the runners squeak just slightly—an honest sound, softened by decades of use. The wood is beautiful under the glare of a shiny, ambered topcoat, but the gloss is cracked in places and the color has drifted toward orange. You imagine this piece lightened, its grain breathing again, ready for a new finish that fits your home today. There’s just one thing between you and that vision: the practical reality of wood finish removal. You’ve heard horror stories about harsh chemicals, gummy messes, and hours of sanding that erase crisp edges. You’ve also heard promises about citrus strippers and miracle gels. Somewhere between the extremes sits a safe, effective path—one that respects both your health and the furniture’s history.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-remove-polyurethane-or-varnish-safely-from-furniture-wood-finish-removal/cards/facebook/how-to-remove-polyurethane-or-varnish-safely-from-furniture-wood-finish-removal.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-remove-polyurethane-or-varnish-safely-from-furniture-wood-finish-removal/cards/facebook/how-to-remove-polyurethane-or-varnish-safely-from-furniture-wood-finish-removal.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-remove-polyurethane-or-varnish-safely-from-furniture-wood-finish-removal/cards/facebook/how-to-remove-polyurethane-or-varnish-safely-from-furniture-wood-finish-removal.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-remove-polyurethane-or-varnish-safely-from-furniture-wood-finish-removal/cards/instagram/how-to-remove-polyurethane-or-varnish-safely-from-furniture-wood-finish-removal.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-remove-polyurethane-or-varnish-safely-from-furniture-wood-finish-removal/cards/instagram/how-to-remove-polyurethane-or-varnish-safely-from-furniture-wood-finish-removal.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-remove-polyurethane-or-varnish-safely-from-furniture-wood-finish-removal/cards/instagram/how-to-remove-polyurethane-or-varnish-safely-from-furniture-wood-finish-removal.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-remove-polyurethane-or-varnish-safely-from-furniture-wood-finish-removal/cards/pinterest/how-to-remove-polyurethane-or-varnish-safely-from-furniture-wood-finish-removal.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-remove-polyurethane-or-varnish-safely-from-furniture-wood-finish-removal/cards/pinterest/how-to-remove-polyurethane-or-varnish-safely-from-furniture-wood-finish-removal.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-remove-polyurethane-or-varnish-safely-from-furniture-wood-finish-removal/cards/pinterest/how-to-remove-polyurethane-or-varnish-safely-from-furniture-wood-finish-removal.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-remove-polyurethane-or-varnish-safely-from-furniture-wood-finish-removal/cards/facebook/how-to-remove-polyurethane-or-varnish-safely-from-furniture-wood-finish-removal.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-remove-polyurethane-or-varnish-safely-from-furniture-wood-finish-removal/cards/facebook/how-to-remove-polyurethane-or-varnish-safely-from-furniture-wood-finish-removal.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-remove-polyurethane-or-varnish-safely-from-furniture-wood-finish-removal/cards/facebook/how-to-remove-polyurethane-or-varnish-safely-from-furniture-wood-finish-removal.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Film Backing For Uniform Fine Scratches</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 08 Nov 2025 13:28:53 +0000</pubDate><category>Backing Types &amp; Coatings</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>orbital sander</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>Engineer-tested guidance on film-backed, open coat sandpaper for uniform fine scratches, with data, setups, and grit sequencing tips.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="open-coat-sandpaper-on-film-for-fine-scratches"&gt;Open coat sandpaper on film for fine scratches&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The raking light told the truth I didn’t want to hear. After an hour shaping a walnut desktop, the surface looked perfect under diffuse shop lights—but the morning sun found every swirl and pigtail. I’d sanded carefully, stepped through grits, and kept the pad moving. Still, the micro-scratches telegraphed through as soon as I wiped on mineral spirits. That’s the moment I switched to film-backed abrasives and, crucially, open coat sandpaper for the early and mid-grits. The difference wasn’t subtle; it was measurable.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/instagram/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/instagram/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/instagram/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Wet Sanding To Control Marine Dust</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 08 Nov 2025 00:54:10 +0000</pubDate><category>Marine Sanding</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>orbital sander</category><category>dry sanding</category><category>sanding block</category><category>mirror finish</category><description>Learn wet boat sanding to cut toxic dust, protect waterways, and prep your hull right.

&lt;p&gt;There’s a particular quiet to the yard before sunrise. The halyards ping, the coffee steams in a chipped thermos, and the hull you’ve been avoiding stands there like a promise you can’t put off. I’ve been on both sides of that moment—rushing, dusty, and regretting shortcuts later—and the method that changed the game for me was wet boat sanding. Not because it’s pretty, but because it’s efficient, safer for your lungs, and easier to keep the neighbors and the yard manager happy. You control the mess. You protect the water you love. And you end the day with a hull that’s flatter, cooler, and ready to bond.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding/cards/instagram/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding/cards/instagram/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding/cards/instagram/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding/cards/pinterest/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding/cards/pinterest/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding/cards/pinterest/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/wet-sanding-to-control-marine-dust-boat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>How To Choose A Starting Grit</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/how-to-choose-a-starting-grit-sandpaper-grit-chart/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/how-to-choose-a-starting-grit-sandpaper-grit-chart/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 06 Nov 2025 15:25:52 +0000</pubDate><category>Grit Guide &amp; Education</category><category>grit chart</category><category>abrasive standards</category><category>grit progression</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-101</category><category>grit-120</category><category>clear coat</category><category>orbital sander</category><description>Learn how to choose your starting grit with a clear sandpaper grit chart, shop-tested sequences, and pro tips for clean, fast, and flat sanding.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="sandpaper-grit-chart-choose-the-right-starting-grit"&gt;Sandpaper Grit Chart: Choose the Right Starting Grit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first time I watched a flawless finish come alive, it happened in the last ten minutes of a long Saturday in the shop. Cold radio in the background, dust collector humming, I wiped a splash of mineral spirits across a dining tabletop and the grain popped like a film reveal. That moment didn’t come from luck—it came from choosing the right starting grit. I keep a small sandpaper grit chart taped to my cabinet door, not because I can’t memorize grits, but because the surface in front of you changes the rules. A hundred-year-old oak stained dark is not the same as new maple fresh off the planer. Paint sprayed last month is not like six coats of hand-brushed oil from the 90s. The trick is reading the job, then picking the grit that does the heavy lifting without making more work.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/how-to-choose-a-starting-grit-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/how-to-choose-a-starting-grit-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/how-to-choose-a-starting-grit-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/how-to-choose-a-starting-grit-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/how-to-choose-a-starting-grit-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/how-to-choose-a-starting-grit-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/how-to-choose-a-starting-grit-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/instagram/how-to-choose-a-starting-grit-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/how-to-choose-a-starting-grit-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/instagram/how-to-choose-a-starting-grit-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/how-to-choose-a-starting-grit-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/instagram/how-to-choose-a-starting-grit-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/how-to-choose-a-starting-grit-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/pinterest/how-to-choose-a-starting-grit-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/how-to-choose-a-starting-grit-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/pinterest/how-to-choose-a-starting-grit-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/how-to-choose-a-starting-grit-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/pinterest/how-to-choose-a-starting-grit-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/how-to-choose-a-starting-grit-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/how-to-choose-a-starting-grit-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/how-to-choose-a-starting-grit-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/how-to-choose-a-starting-grit-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/how-to-choose-a-starting-grit-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/how-to-choose-a-starting-grit-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Choose Hose Diameter For Best Suction</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 06 Nov 2025 14:24:00 +0000</pubDate><category>Dust Extraction Systems</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>dry sanding</category><category>orbital sander</category><category>sanding block</category><category>joint compound</category><description>An engineer’s guide to hose diameter for dustless sanding—get the best suction, cleaner air, and faster finishing with data-driven choices.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="dustless-sanding-pick-the-right-hose-diameter"&gt;Dustless Sanding: Pick the Right Hose Diameter&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first time I tried to sand a maple tabletop in my small garage, I didn’t plan for the dust. Within minutes, a visible cloud hovered over my workbench, the air had that chalky taste, and the light from the door turned into a foggy beam. The sander did its job, but the shop felt uninhabitable. Fast-forward to today, and my setup looks completely different: a quiet extractor hums under the bench, a smooth-bore hose clips into a sander with a snug port connection, and the cleanup is mostly emptying a bag. The shift to dustless sanding wasn’t just about comfort—it was about control. Once you understand how hose diameter, hose length, and vacuum performance interact, you can tune a system that captures chips and submicron dust instead of aerosolizing it.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding/cards/facebook/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding/cards/facebook/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding/cards/facebook/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding/cards/instagram/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding/cards/instagram/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding/cards/instagram/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding/cards/pinterest/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding/cards/pinterest/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding/cards/pinterest/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding/cards/facebook/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding/cards/facebook/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding/cards/facebook/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Difference Between Da And Random Orbital Sanding</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 05 Nov 2025 13:35:28 +0000</pubDate><category>Random Orbital Sanding</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>dust control</category><category>clear coat</category><category>orbital sander</category><description>An engineer’s guide to the difference between DA and random orbital sanding, with test-based advice on speed, finish, abrasives, and setup.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="da-vs-random-orbital-sanding-an-engineers-guide"&gt;DA vs random orbital sanding: an engineer’s guide&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning in the shop, the kettle clicks off as the garage door rolls up and a slab of maple waits on the sawhorses. The winter light is unforgiving; it shows every swirl that last year’s “good enough” sanding left behind. In one hand: a well-balanced 5-inch palm sander; in the other: a heavier, gear-driven unit that can bulldoze epoxy ridges like a planer. The decision—random orbital sanding or the so-called DA—doesn’t feel philosophical. It’s practical. Do I want a fast, aggressive cut to level those glue lines, or a controlled, low-risk finish for the final passes? If you’ve ever chased phantom swirls under a bright lamp or watched edges burn through because you leaned a degree too far, you know the stakes.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/instagram/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/instagram/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/instagram/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/pinterest/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/pinterest/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/pinterest/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Sic Versus Aluminum Oxide Differences</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 04 Nov 2025 02:51:33 +0000</pubDate><category>Abrasive Materials &amp; Compounds</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>dry sanding</category><category>clear coat</category><category>orbital sander</category><category>sanding block</category><description>Compare silicon carbide sandpaper and aluminum oxide to choose the right abrasive for wood, metal, and paint.

&lt;p&gt;On a quiet Saturday afternoon, you clamp down the last door of that heirloom dresser you’ve been restoring. The grain finally shows through the old varnish, but the surface still isn’t the mirror-smooth finish you pictured. You reach for a fresh sheet, feel the grit with your thumb, and hesitate—this is where the choice between silicon carbide sandpaper and aluminum oxide decides whether you’ll spend the evening admiring your work or chasing scratches you didn’t mean to make. Maybe you’re here because a paint finish went cloudy after dry sanding, or a clear coat took a hopscotch of swirls under shop lights. Or maybe your belt sander chewed through hook-and-loop discs like a wood chipper and you need something tougher and more predictable.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/instagram/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/instagram/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/instagram/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>13</readingTime></item><item><title>When Ceramic Outperforms Aluminum Oxide</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 13:34:14 +0000</pubDate><category>Ceramic &amp; Premium Abrasives</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-180</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>dry sanding</category><category>clear coat</category><category>orbital sander</category><category>dust control</category><description>Learn when ceramic sanding discs beat aluminum oxide: cut rate, heat control, cost per part, and pro tips for metal, wood, and composites.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="when-ceramic-sanding-discs-outperform-aluminum-oxide"&gt;When Ceramic Sanding Discs Outperform Aluminum Oxide&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a quiet Saturday morning, the garage becomes your studio. You’ve cleared a workbench, lined up clamps and rags, and lit the space with a warm shop lamp. The project is personal: a welded steel coffee table for the living room, something sturdy and simple that can hold the weight of everyday life. The first passes with a grinder feel hopeful—until the discs start glazing. Heat builds, paint smears, and the cut slows to a crawl. You switch to a finer grit, then back again, but the aluminum oxide discs keep dulling, forcing you to lean harder. The surface looks scuffed but not flat, and your shoulders ache from forcing the tool to do what the abrasive simply won’t.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Velcro Disc Attachment For Orbital Sanders</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 04:51:13 +0000</pubDate><category>Hook-and-Loop Discs</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>orbital sander</category><description>Engineer-tested guide to hook and loop sanding discs, from pad heat and disc selection to failure modes, setup tips, and performance tests.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="hook-and-loop-sanding-discs-for-orbital-sanders"&gt;Hook and Loop Sanding Discs for Orbital Sanders&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Saturday morning in the shop starts with optimism—the kind that comes with fresh coffee, a new sheet of maple, and the subtle hum of a random orbital sander spooling up. Ten minutes later, optimism hits the floor with the sanding disc. If you’ve been there, you know the feeling: the Velcro-style backing is glazed, the pad hooks are shiny and rounded over, and every new disc lasts a little shorter than the last. The culprit isn’t just cheap consumables; more often it’s heat, pressure, and a mismatch between tool, pad, and abrasive. This is where hook and loop sanding discs earn both their reputation for convenience and the blame when the system isn’t set up correctly.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>15</readingTime></item><item><title>Prevent Swirl Marks With Random Orbital Sanders</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 02:33:16 +0000</pubDate><category>Random Orbital Sanding</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-800</category><category>dust control</category><category>grit progression</category><category>dry sanding</category><category>clear coat</category><category>orbital sander</category><description>Learn expert workflows to eliminate swirl marks with random orbital sanding—covering surface prep, abrasives, dust control, and inspection.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanding"&gt;Prevent Swirl Marks with Random Orbital Sanding&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning, low sun at the window, the first coat of finish flashes across the panel you’ve been nursing all week. The figure in the oak wakes up, but so do faint halos you didn’t see under shop lights. Swirl marks. You tilt the board, squint, and realize you were moments from locking those defects under a film for good. It’s a gut-punch that most woodworkers and finish carpenters eventually feel. The culprit is rarely the tool itself; it’s the stack of process decisions that lead to one outcome or the other. The relief is that processes are controllable, and with random orbital sanding done deliberately, swirls are optional.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding/cards/instagram/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding/cards/instagram/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding/cards/instagram/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding/cards/pinterest/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding/cards/pinterest/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding/cards/pinterest/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/prevent-swirl-marks-with-random-orbital-sanders-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>13</readingTime></item></channel></rss>

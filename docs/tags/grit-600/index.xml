&lt;p&gt;Late on a Saturday, the workshop is cool and quiet. You lay a scratched glass shelf across a rubber mat, switch on a raking light, and mist the surface. The first strokes feel confident—diamond pad gliding, water whispering—and a milky ribbon forms under your hand. It’s satisfying, watching material move. But if you’ve been here before, you know that ribbon lies. The slurry can look like progress while hiding the truth beneath. Up close, glass is ruthless about honesty; the moment you stop, the sheen of the wet film comforts you into thinking you’ve won. You haven’t—yet. The only way forward is to clean the slurry and see the real surface.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/23.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/13/clean-slurry-to-see-true-surface-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/clean-slurry-to-see-true-surface-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/13/clean-slurry-to-see-true-surface-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/clean-slurry-to-see-true-surface-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/13/clean-slurry-to-see-true-surface-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/clean-slurry-to-see-true-surface-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/13/clean-slurry-to-see-true-surface-glass-sanding/cards/instagram/clean-slurry-to-see-true-surface-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/13/clean-slurry-to-see-true-surface-glass-sanding/cards/instagram/clean-slurry-to-see-true-surface-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/13/clean-slurry-to-see-true-surface-glass-sanding/cards/instagram/clean-slurry-to-see-true-surface-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/13/clean-slurry-to-see-true-surface-glass-sanding/cards/pinterest/clean-slurry-to-see-true-surface-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/13/clean-slurry-to-see-true-surface-glass-sanding/cards/pinterest/clean-slurry-to-see-true-surface-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/13/clean-slurry-to-see-true-surface-glass-sanding/cards/pinterest/clean-slurry-to-see-true-surface-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/13/clean-slurry-to-see-true-surface-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/clean-slurry-to-see-true-surface-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/13/clean-slurry-to-see-true-surface-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/clean-slurry-to-see-true-surface-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/13/clean-slurry-to-see-true-surface-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/clean-slurry-to-see-true-surface-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Inspect Haze Under Strong Lighting</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/12/inspect-haze-under-strong-lighting-microfinishing-film/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/12/inspect-haze-under-strong-lighting-microfinishing-film/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 15:14:35 +0000</pubDate><category>Specialty Abrasives</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-1358</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>clear coat</category><description>Learn to inspect paint haze under strong light and refine surfaces with microfinishing film, with clear steps, tools, and pro tips for a flawless finish.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="inspecting-haze-under-lights-with-microfinishing-film"&gt;Inspecting Haze Under Lights with Microfinishing Film&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Late on a quiet Saturday, you roll your car into the garage, switch off the overhead fluorescents, and click on a handheld LED. The beam cuts across the paint like a spotlight at a small-town theater, revealing a performance you didn’t plan to see: a soft, cloudy veil that dances when you tilt the light. By daylight, it looked perfect. Under strong lighting, the haze is undeniable. Your heart sinks for a moment—not because the job failed, but because you didn’t have the right viewing conditions to judge it. This is the moment when craft and care intersect with truth. Strong light doesn’t create haze; it exposes it, inviting you to refine your process.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/17.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/12/inspect-haze-under-strong-lighting-microfinishing-film/cards/facebook/inspect-haze-under-strong-lighting-microfinishing-film.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/12/inspect-haze-under-strong-lighting-microfinishing-film/cards/facebook/inspect-haze-under-strong-lighting-microfinishing-film.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/12/inspect-haze-under-strong-lighting-microfinishing-film/cards/facebook/inspect-haze-under-strong-lighting-microfinishing-film.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/12/inspect-haze-under-strong-lighting-microfinishing-film/cards/instagram/inspect-haze-under-strong-lighting-microfinishing-film.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/12/inspect-haze-under-strong-lighting-microfinishing-film/cards/instagram/inspect-haze-under-strong-lighting-microfinishing-film.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/12/inspect-haze-under-strong-lighting-microfinishing-film/cards/instagram/inspect-haze-under-strong-lighting-microfinishing-film.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/12/inspect-haze-under-strong-lighting-microfinishing-film/cards/pinterest/inspect-haze-under-strong-lighting-microfinishing-film.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/12/inspect-haze-under-strong-lighting-microfinishing-film/cards/pinterest/inspect-haze-under-strong-lighting-microfinishing-film.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/12/inspect-haze-under-strong-lighting-microfinishing-film/cards/pinterest/inspect-haze-under-strong-lighting-microfinishing-film.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/12/inspect-haze-under-strong-lighting-microfinishing-film/cards/facebook/inspect-haze-under-strong-lighting-microfinishing-film.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/12/inspect-haze-under-strong-lighting-microfinishing-film/cards/facebook/inspect-haze-under-strong-lighting-microfinishing-film.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/12/inspect-haze-under-strong-lighting-microfinishing-film/cards/facebook/inspect-haze-under-strong-lighting-microfinishing-film.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Difference Between Paper And Film At Fine Grits</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/11/difference-between-paper-and-film-at-fine-grits-sandpaper-grit/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/11/difference-between-paper-and-film-at-fine-grits-sandpaper-grit/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 14:20:24 +0000</pubDate><category>Grit Range &amp; Classification</category><category>grit-101</category><category>grit-280</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-1200</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-2000</category><description>Understand paper vs film at fine sandpaper grit: scratch quality, heat control, dust extraction, and pro workflows for wood, paint, and resin.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="paper-vs-film-at-fine-sandpaper-grit"&gt;Paper vs Film at Fine Sandpaper Grit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The raking light doesn’t lie. You step back from a newly lacquered side table, swipe your palm across the surface, and angle a work lamp until the beam scrapes across the sheen. There they are—ghost rings, faint pigtails, witness lines from a previous pass that seemed flawless under overhead lighting. If you’ve been here before, you already know this isn’t a matter of elbow grease—it’s about control. Control starts with substrate stability, mineral uniformity, and careful sequencing of sandpaper grit. At fine grades, the difference between paper-backed abrasives and polyester film is not academic; it’s the difference between hitting final gloss in one polishing cycle or chasing micro-scratches through an entire morning.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/11.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/11/difference-between-paper-and-film-at-fine-grits-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/difference-between-paper-and-film-at-fine-grits-sandpaper-grit.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/11/difference-between-paper-and-film-at-fine-grits-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/difference-between-paper-and-film-at-fine-grits-sandpaper-grit.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/11/difference-between-paper-and-film-at-fine-grits-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/difference-between-paper-and-film-at-fine-grits-sandpaper-grit.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/11/difference-between-paper-and-film-at-fine-grits-sandpaper-grit/cards/instagram/difference-between-paper-and-film-at-fine-grits-sandpaper-grit.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/11/difference-between-paper-and-film-at-fine-grits-sandpaper-grit/cards/instagram/difference-between-paper-and-film-at-fine-grits-sandpaper-grit.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/11/difference-between-paper-and-film-at-fine-grits-sandpaper-grit/cards/instagram/difference-between-paper-and-film-at-fine-grits-sandpaper-grit.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/11/difference-between-paper-and-film-at-fine-grits-sandpaper-grit/cards/pinterest/difference-between-paper-and-film-at-fine-grits-sandpaper-grit.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/11/difference-between-paper-and-film-at-fine-grits-sandpaper-grit/cards/pinterest/difference-between-paper-and-film-at-fine-grits-sandpaper-grit.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/11/difference-between-paper-and-film-at-fine-grits-sandpaper-grit/cards/pinterest/difference-between-paper-and-film-at-fine-grits-sandpaper-grit.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/11/difference-between-paper-and-film-at-fine-grits-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/difference-between-paper-and-film-at-fine-grits-sandpaper-grit.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/11/difference-between-paper-and-film-at-fine-grits-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/difference-between-paper-and-film-at-fine-grits-sandpaper-grit.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/11/difference-between-paper-and-film-at-fine-grits-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/difference-between-paper-and-film-at-fine-grits-sandpaper-grit.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>When To Sand Between Coats Of Water-Based Finish</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/06/when-to-sand-between-coats-of-water-based-finish-between-coats-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/06/when-to-sand-between-coats-of-water-based-finish-between-coats-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 14:06:32 +0000</pubDate><category>Between-Coats Sanding</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-2400</category><category>orbital sander</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Learn exactly when and how to do between coats sanding on water-based finishes.

&lt;p&gt;The first time I chased a flawless water-based finish, I watched the light graze across a new maple desk and saw nothing but promise—and dust nibs. Under the shop’s afternoon sun, every tiny speck caught the eye. I had followed the schedule, measured film build, and kept a clean bench. But the finish felt slightly rough, like a fine orange peel. I knew what came next: between coats sanding. The question was not whether to sand, but when—and how—to avoid cutting through those early coats or, worse, clogging the abrasive with half-cured resin.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/16.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/06/when-to-sand-between-coats-of-water-based-finish-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/when-to-sand-between-coats-of-water-based-finish-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/06/when-to-sand-between-coats-of-water-based-finish-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/when-to-sand-between-coats-of-water-based-finish-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/06/when-to-sand-between-coats-of-water-based-finish-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/when-to-sand-between-coats-of-water-based-finish-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/06/when-to-sand-between-coats-of-water-based-finish-between-coats-sanding/cards/instagram/when-to-sand-between-coats-of-water-based-finish-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/06/when-to-sand-between-coats-of-water-based-finish-between-coats-sanding/cards/instagram/when-to-sand-between-coats-of-water-based-finish-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/06/when-to-sand-between-coats-of-water-based-finish-between-coats-sanding/cards/instagram/when-to-sand-between-coats-of-water-based-finish-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/06/when-to-sand-between-coats-of-water-based-finish-between-coats-sanding/cards/pinterest/when-to-sand-between-coats-of-water-based-finish-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/06/when-to-sand-between-coats-of-water-based-finish-between-coats-sanding/cards/pinterest/when-to-sand-between-coats-of-water-based-finish-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/06/when-to-sand-between-coats-of-water-based-finish-between-coats-sanding/cards/pinterest/when-to-sand-between-coats-of-water-based-finish-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/06/when-to-sand-between-coats-of-water-based-finish-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/when-to-sand-between-coats-of-water-based-finish-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/06/when-to-sand-between-coats-of-water-based-finish-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/when-to-sand-between-coats-of-water-based-finish-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/06/when-to-sand-between-coats-of-water-based-finish-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/when-to-sand-between-coats-of-water-based-finish-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Best Grit To Scuff Sand Previously Painted Baseboards</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/02/best-grit-to-scuff-sand-previously-painted-baseboards-baseboard-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/02/best-grit-to-scuff-sand-previously-painted-baseboards-baseboard-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 14:57:53 +0000</pubDate><category>Trim &amp; Molding Sanding</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>Find the best grit to scuff sand previously painted baseboards.

&lt;p&gt;By the time the morning light sweeps across the hallway, every flaw in your trim becomes a quiet distraction: a chipped edge near the doorstop, a line of roller orange peel above the shoe molding, the glossy band where furniture grazed the baseboard. You run a fingertip along a suspect stretch of paint, and it feels slick, impervious—more like a plastic shell than something ready to bond with a fresh coat. It’s a moment many of us know: the desire to fix everything before the day gets busy, weighed against the fear of making it worse. That’s exactly where baseboard sanding earns its keep. It’s the technician’s shortcut to predictability—matting the sheen, leveling micro-defects, and creating a uniformly keyed surface that primer and enamel can actually bite into.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/29.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/02/best-grit-to-scuff-sand-previously-painted-baseboards-baseboard-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-to-scuff-sand-previously-painted-baseboards-baseboard-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/02/best-grit-to-scuff-sand-previously-painted-baseboards-baseboard-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-to-scuff-sand-previously-painted-baseboards-baseboard-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/02/best-grit-to-scuff-sand-previously-painted-baseboards-baseboard-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-to-scuff-sand-previously-painted-baseboards-baseboard-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/02/best-grit-to-scuff-sand-previously-painted-baseboards-baseboard-sanding/cards/instagram/best-grit-to-scuff-sand-previously-painted-baseboards-baseboard-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/02/best-grit-to-scuff-sand-previously-painted-baseboards-baseboard-sanding/cards/instagram/best-grit-to-scuff-sand-previously-painted-baseboards-baseboard-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/02/best-grit-to-scuff-sand-previously-painted-baseboards-baseboard-sanding/cards/instagram/best-grit-to-scuff-sand-previously-painted-baseboards-baseboard-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/02/best-grit-to-scuff-sand-previously-painted-baseboards-baseboard-sanding/cards/pinterest/best-grit-to-scuff-sand-previously-painted-baseboards-baseboard-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/02/best-grit-to-scuff-sand-previously-painted-baseboards-baseboard-sanding/cards/pinterest/best-grit-to-scuff-sand-previously-painted-baseboards-baseboard-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/02/best-grit-to-scuff-sand-previously-painted-baseboards-baseboard-sanding/cards/pinterest/best-grit-to-scuff-sand-previously-painted-baseboards-baseboard-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/02/best-grit-to-scuff-sand-previously-painted-baseboards-baseboard-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-to-scuff-sand-previously-painted-baseboards-baseboard-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/02/best-grit-to-scuff-sand-previously-painted-baseboards-baseboard-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-to-scuff-sand-previously-painted-baseboards-baseboard-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/02/best-grit-to-scuff-sand-previously-painted-baseboards-baseboard-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-to-scuff-sand-previously-painted-baseboards-baseboard-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Flatten Glued Up Panels With Long Sanding Blocks</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/01/flatten-glued-up-panels-with-long-sanding-blocks-surface-leveling/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/01/flatten-glued-up-panels-with-long-sanding-blocks-surface-leveling/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 01 Feb 2026 15:09:29 +0000</pubDate><category>Wood sanding</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit progression</category><category>clear coat</category><category>sanding block</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>Learn surface leveling with long sanding blocks to flatten glued-up panels cleanly, accurately, and without a planer—pro tips from a workshop specialist.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="surface-leveling-flatten-glued-up-panels-by-hand"&gt;Surface Leveling: Flatten Glued-Up Panels by Hand&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The clamps click loose on a Saturday morning, and the shop exhales. You can smell the faint sweetness of cured glue and yesterday’s coffee. The panel—boards you’ve nursed from rough lumber to edge-jointed strips—comes out of the pipe clamps like a promise. But every promise needs work. There’s a whisper of misalignment at the seams, a few proud edges, maybe a clamp bruise. You don’t own a drum sander, and your benchtop planer isn’t wide enough. Still, the goal doesn’t change: a dead-flat, honest surface that feels like a single piece of wood under your palm.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/25.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/01/flatten-glued-up-panels-with-long-sanding-blocks-surface-leveling/cards/facebook/flatten-glued-up-panels-with-long-sanding-blocks-surface-leveling.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/01/flatten-glued-up-panels-with-long-sanding-blocks-surface-leveling/cards/facebook/flatten-glued-up-panels-with-long-sanding-blocks-surface-leveling.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/01/flatten-glued-up-panels-with-long-sanding-blocks-surface-leveling/cards/facebook/flatten-glued-up-panels-with-long-sanding-blocks-surface-leveling.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/01/flatten-glued-up-panels-with-long-sanding-blocks-surface-leveling/cards/instagram/flatten-glued-up-panels-with-long-sanding-blocks-surface-leveling.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/01/flatten-glued-up-panels-with-long-sanding-blocks-surface-leveling/cards/instagram/flatten-glued-up-panels-with-long-sanding-blocks-surface-leveling.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/01/flatten-glued-up-panels-with-long-sanding-blocks-surface-leveling/cards/instagram/flatten-glued-up-panels-with-long-sanding-blocks-surface-leveling.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/01/flatten-glued-up-panels-with-long-sanding-blocks-surface-leveling/cards/pinterest/flatten-glued-up-panels-with-long-sanding-blocks-surface-leveling.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/01/flatten-glued-up-panels-with-long-sanding-blocks-surface-leveling/cards/pinterest/flatten-glued-up-panels-with-long-sanding-blocks-surface-leveling.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/01/flatten-glued-up-panels-with-long-sanding-blocks-surface-leveling/cards/pinterest/flatten-glued-up-panels-with-long-sanding-blocks-surface-leveling.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/01/flatten-glued-up-panels-with-long-sanding-blocks-surface-leveling/cards/facebook/flatten-glued-up-panels-with-long-sanding-blocks-surface-leveling.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/01/flatten-glued-up-panels-with-long-sanding-blocks-surface-leveling/cards/facebook/flatten-glued-up-panels-with-long-sanding-blocks-surface-leveling.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/01/flatten-glued-up-panels-with-long-sanding-blocks-surface-leveling/cards/facebook/flatten-glued-up-panels-with-long-sanding-blocks-surface-leveling.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Lifecycle Cost Modeling For Abrasives</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/01/lifecycle-cost-modeling-for-abrasives-abrasive-testing/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/01/lifecycle-cost-modeling-for-abrasives-abrasive-testing/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 01 Feb 2026 13:49:45 +0000</pubDate><category>Abrasive Innovation &amp; Testing</category><category>grit-600</category><description>Engineer’s guide to abrasive testing and lifecycle cost modeling—measure wear, efficiency, and true blasting cost with data-driven methods and tips.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="abrasive-testing-and-lifecycle-cost-modeling"&gt;Abrasive Testing and Lifecycle Cost Modeling&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I stepped into the blast room at 6:30 a.m., the compressor’s thrum had that familiar, chest-deep resonance. Fine dust hung in the beam of a security light, catching motes of garnet and steel grit like winter snow. A foreman handed me a clipboard with last week’s production numbers: square meters completed, bags consumed, hours clocked, filter changes, and an unexpected spike in downtime. The crew had trialed a cheaper expendable media, thinking the unit cost would help this quarter’s margin. Instead, the reclaim was flooded with fines, the dust collector’s differential pressure crept into the red, and two hours vanished each shift to housekeeping. These are the moments where abrasive testing earns its keep: not as an abstract lab ritual, but as the data backbone that turns blasting from guesswork into a controlled, predictable cost engine.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/23.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/01/lifecycle-cost-modeling-for-abrasives-abrasive-testing/cards/facebook/lifecycle-cost-modeling-for-abrasives-abrasive-testing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/01/lifecycle-cost-modeling-for-abrasives-abrasive-testing/cards/facebook/lifecycle-cost-modeling-for-abrasives-abrasive-testing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/01/lifecycle-cost-modeling-for-abrasives-abrasive-testing/cards/facebook/lifecycle-cost-modeling-for-abrasives-abrasive-testing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/01/lifecycle-cost-modeling-for-abrasives-abrasive-testing/cards/instagram/lifecycle-cost-modeling-for-abrasives-abrasive-testing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/01/lifecycle-cost-modeling-for-abrasives-abrasive-testing/cards/instagram/lifecycle-cost-modeling-for-abrasives-abrasive-testing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/01/lifecycle-cost-modeling-for-abrasives-abrasive-testing/cards/instagram/lifecycle-cost-modeling-for-abrasives-abrasive-testing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/01/lifecycle-cost-modeling-for-abrasives-abrasive-testing/cards/pinterest/lifecycle-cost-modeling-for-abrasives-abrasive-testing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/01/lifecycle-cost-modeling-for-abrasives-abrasive-testing/cards/pinterest/lifecycle-cost-modeling-for-abrasives-abrasive-testing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/01/lifecycle-cost-modeling-for-abrasives-abrasive-testing/cards/pinterest/lifecycle-cost-modeling-for-abrasives-abrasive-testing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/01/lifecycle-cost-modeling-for-abrasives-abrasive-testing/cards/facebook/lifecycle-cost-modeling-for-abrasives-abrasive-testing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/01/lifecycle-cost-modeling-for-abrasives-abrasive-testing/cards/facebook/lifecycle-cost-modeling-for-abrasives-abrasive-testing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/01/lifecycle-cost-modeling-for-abrasives-abrasive-testing/cards/facebook/lifecycle-cost-modeling-for-abrasives-abrasive-testing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Use Pencil Guide Marks To Track Sanding Progress</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/31/use-pencil-guide-marks-to-track-sanding-progress-hand-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/31/use-pencil-guide-marks-to-track-sanding-progress-hand-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 14:53:05 +0000</pubDate><category>Hand Sanding Techniques</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit progression</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>with precision.

&lt;p&gt;The garage is quiet except for the soft rasp of paper over wood. It’s early, the kind of morning when you can see your breath just a little, and the coffee hasn’t cooled yet. There’s a maple tabletop on the horses, and your first instinct is to reach for a random orbital and a handful of discs. But you pause. Today is about control, about reading the surface rather than forcing it. You sharpen a pencil and trace quick, looping witness marks across the panel, a light lattice that looks almost careless—until you start hand sanding. Stroke after deliberate stroke, the graphite becomes a progress meter, revealing the high spots that clear first and the stubborn low areas that hold onto their gray shadows. You’re not just smoothing wood; you’re mapping it in real time.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/21.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/31/use-pencil-guide-marks-to-track-sanding-progress-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/use-pencil-guide-marks-to-track-sanding-progress-hand-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/31/use-pencil-guide-marks-to-track-sanding-progress-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/use-pencil-guide-marks-to-track-sanding-progress-hand-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/31/use-pencil-guide-marks-to-track-sanding-progress-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/use-pencil-guide-marks-to-track-sanding-progress-hand-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/31/use-pencil-guide-marks-to-track-sanding-progress-hand-sanding/cards/instagram/use-pencil-guide-marks-to-track-sanding-progress-hand-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/31/use-pencil-guide-marks-to-track-sanding-progress-hand-sanding/cards/instagram/use-pencil-guide-marks-to-track-sanding-progress-hand-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/31/use-pencil-guide-marks-to-track-sanding-progress-hand-sanding/cards/instagram/use-pencil-guide-marks-to-track-sanding-progress-hand-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/31/use-pencil-guide-marks-to-track-sanding-progress-hand-sanding/cards/pinterest/use-pencil-guide-marks-to-track-sanding-progress-hand-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/31/use-pencil-guide-marks-to-track-sanding-progress-hand-sanding/cards/pinterest/use-pencil-guide-marks-to-track-sanding-progress-hand-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/31/use-pencil-guide-marks-to-track-sanding-progress-hand-sanding/cards/pinterest/use-pencil-guide-marks-to-track-sanding-progress-hand-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/31/use-pencil-guide-marks-to-track-sanding-progress-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/use-pencil-guide-marks-to-track-sanding-progress-hand-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/31/use-pencil-guide-marks-to-track-sanding-progress-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/use-pencil-guide-marks-to-track-sanding-progress-hand-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/31/use-pencil-guide-marks-to-track-sanding-progress-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/use-pencil-guide-marks-to-track-sanding-progress-hand-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Uv Exposure Considerations For Finishes</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/27/uv-exposure-considerations-for-finishes-boat-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/27/uv-exposure-considerations-for-finishes-boat-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 14:39:59 +0000</pubDate><category>Marine Sanding</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-2000</category><description>Learn boat sanding and UV-smart finishing from a pro.

&lt;p&gt;The marina was quiet, just the slap of little waves on hulls and the faint smell of salt and sunscreen left in the breeze. I ran my palm along a sunburned toerail—chalky, dry, and rough like a beach pebble. That’s what months of UV does to finishes: sucks the oils out, bleaches pigment, and opens tiny fissures that drink water. I’ve seen it a hundred times on boats that live uncovered. The fix isn’t glamorous, but it is satisfying: smart prep, disciplined boat sanding, and a finish system built to fight sunlight. If we do the work methodically, you’ll watch the surface tighten up, grain pop, and water bead the way it should.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/09.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/27/uv-exposure-considerations-for-finishes-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/uv-exposure-considerations-for-finishes-boat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/27/uv-exposure-considerations-for-finishes-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/uv-exposure-considerations-for-finishes-boat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/27/uv-exposure-considerations-for-finishes-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/uv-exposure-considerations-for-finishes-boat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/27/uv-exposure-considerations-for-finishes-boat-sanding/cards/instagram/uv-exposure-considerations-for-finishes-boat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/27/uv-exposure-considerations-for-finishes-boat-sanding/cards/instagram/uv-exposure-considerations-for-finishes-boat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/27/uv-exposure-considerations-for-finishes-boat-sanding/cards/instagram/uv-exposure-considerations-for-finishes-boat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/27/uv-exposure-considerations-for-finishes-boat-sanding/cards/pinterest/uv-exposure-considerations-for-finishes-boat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/27/uv-exposure-considerations-for-finishes-boat-sanding/cards/pinterest/uv-exposure-considerations-for-finishes-boat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/27/uv-exposure-considerations-for-finishes-boat-sanding/cards/pinterest/uv-exposure-considerations-for-finishes-boat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/27/uv-exposure-considerations-for-finishes-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/uv-exposure-considerations-for-finishes-boat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/27/uv-exposure-considerations-for-finishes-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/uv-exposure-considerations-for-finishes-boat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/27/uv-exposure-considerations-for-finishes-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/uv-exposure-considerations-for-finishes-boat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Inspect Under Raking Light For Chips</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/27/inspect-under-raking-light-for-chips-glass-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/27/inspect-under-raking-light-for-chips-glass-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 13:54:02 +0000</pubDate><category>Glass &amp; Ceramics Sanding</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1200</category><category>grit progression</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>sanding block</category><description>Learn how to inspect glass under raking light for chips, then repair and polish with controlled glass sanding, grit sequencing, and safety.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="raking-light-inspection-and-glass-sanding-basics"&gt;Raking Light Inspection and Glass Sanding Basics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A scratched backsplash, a hazy edge on a bottle you plan to turn into a lamp, the faint tick of a chip on a shower door—these are small things you don’t notice until the light hits just right. My moment was a kitchen island, late evening, phone flashlight resting on the quartz and aimed low across a new tempered-glass insert. In daylight it looked flawless. Under raking light, it told the truth: a constellation of micro-chips on the cut edge and a faint scratch arc where a coffee grinder once danced. I’ve worked on abrasive systems long enough to know two facts: defects hide in glare, and what you can’t see you can’t control. Raking light is the quickest way to see, and glass sanding—when done deliberately—is how you take control.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/07.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/27/inspect-under-raking-light-for-chips-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/inspect-under-raking-light-for-chips-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/27/inspect-under-raking-light-for-chips-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/inspect-under-raking-light-for-chips-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/27/inspect-under-raking-light-for-chips-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/inspect-under-raking-light-for-chips-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/27/inspect-under-raking-light-for-chips-glass-sanding/cards/instagram/inspect-under-raking-light-for-chips-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/27/inspect-under-raking-light-for-chips-glass-sanding/cards/instagram/inspect-under-raking-light-for-chips-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/27/inspect-under-raking-light-for-chips-glass-sanding/cards/instagram/inspect-under-raking-light-for-chips-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/27/inspect-under-raking-light-for-chips-glass-sanding/cards/pinterest/inspect-under-raking-light-for-chips-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/27/inspect-under-raking-light-for-chips-glass-sanding/cards/pinterest/inspect-under-raking-light-for-chips-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/27/inspect-under-raking-light-for-chips-glass-sanding/cards/pinterest/inspect-under-raking-light-for-chips-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/27/inspect-under-raking-light-for-chips-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/inspect-under-raking-light-for-chips-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/27/inspect-under-raking-light-for-chips-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/inspect-under-raking-light-for-chips-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/27/inspect-under-raking-light-for-chips-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/inspect-under-raking-light-for-chips-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Squeegee Check To Read Leveling Progress</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/25/squeegee-check-to-read-leveling-progress-wet-dry-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/25/squeegee-check-to-read-leveling-progress-wet-dry-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 14:20:34 +0000</pubDate><category>Waterproof &amp; Wet/Dry Paper</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>dry sanding</category><category>sanding block</category><description>Engineer’s guide to squeegee checks and wet dry sandpaper for reading leveling, choosing abrasives, and avoiding defects in automotive and epoxy finishes.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="master-squeegee-checks-with-wet-dry-sandpaper"&gt;Master squeegee checks with wet dry sandpaper&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning, garage door up, the fender you sprayed last night looks flawless—until you bring it into raking light. The orange-peel you thought you’d erased is still there, just softened by gloss and optimism. You fill a spray bottle, tear off a square of waterproof abrasive, and start working methodically. A few strokes in, the pad feels consistent—no sudden grab, no chatter—just a soft, damp hiss. You pause, reach for a silicone squeegee, and draw a single pass across the panel. The water evacuates, leaving a thin, revealing film. High spots flash glossy first, low spots stay matte. The map of your progress appears in an instant.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/28.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/25/squeegee-check-to-read-leveling-progress-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/squeegee-check-to-read-leveling-progress-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/25/squeegee-check-to-read-leveling-progress-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/squeegee-check-to-read-leveling-progress-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/25/squeegee-check-to-read-leveling-progress-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/squeegee-check-to-read-leveling-progress-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/25/squeegee-check-to-read-leveling-progress-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/instagram/squeegee-check-to-read-leveling-progress-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/25/squeegee-check-to-read-leveling-progress-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/instagram/squeegee-check-to-read-leveling-progress-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/25/squeegee-check-to-read-leveling-progress-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/instagram/squeegee-check-to-read-leveling-progress-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/25/squeegee-check-to-read-leveling-progress-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/squeegee-check-to-read-leveling-progress-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/25/squeegee-check-to-read-leveling-progress-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/squeegee-check-to-read-leveling-progress-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/25/squeegee-check-to-read-leveling-progress-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/squeegee-check-to-read-leveling-progress-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/25/squeegee-check-to-read-leveling-progress-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/squeegee-check-to-read-leveling-progress-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/25/squeegee-check-to-read-leveling-progress-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/squeegee-check-to-read-leveling-progress-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/25/squeegee-check-to-read-leveling-progress-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/squeegee-check-to-read-leveling-progress-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>13</readingTime></item><item><title>Wet Sanding Options To Minimize Airborne Dust</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/23/wet-sanding-options-to-minimize-airborne-dust-dustless-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/23/wet-sanding-options-to-minimize-airborne-dust-dustless-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 13:49:31 +0000</pubDate><category>Dust Extraction Systems</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>dry sanding</category><category>joint compound</category><description>Engineer-tested wet sanding methods that cut airborne dust, improve finish quality, and speed cleanup.

&lt;p&gt;On a quiet Saturday, I watched sunbeams pick up a blizzard of drywall dust in a small, lived‑in apartment. The hallway was taped for paint, a crib sat two doors down, and a stack of sandpaper waited on the drop cloth. Every swipe of a sanding pole cast more white into the air. The homeowner—mask on, windows open—was doing their best, but dust still found a way into the return vents and the closets. I’ve worked in labs and on job sites long enough to know that dust damage isn’t just aesthetic; it creeps into electronics, triggers allergies, and lingers in HVAC systems for months. The question that matters to families and contractors alike becomes practical, not theoretical: can we keep the surface quality high while keeping the air clean?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/20.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/23/wet-sanding-options-to-minimize-airborne-dust-dustless-sanding/cards/facebook/wet-sanding-options-to-minimize-airborne-dust-dustless-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/23/wet-sanding-options-to-minimize-airborne-dust-dustless-sanding/cards/facebook/wet-sanding-options-to-minimize-airborne-dust-dustless-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/23/wet-sanding-options-to-minimize-airborne-dust-dustless-sanding/cards/facebook/wet-sanding-options-to-minimize-airborne-dust-dustless-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/23/wet-sanding-options-to-minimize-airborne-dust-dustless-sanding/cards/instagram/wet-sanding-options-to-minimize-airborne-dust-dustless-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/23/wet-sanding-options-to-minimize-airborne-dust-dustless-sanding/cards/instagram/wet-sanding-options-to-minimize-airborne-dust-dustless-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/23/wet-sanding-options-to-minimize-airborne-dust-dustless-sanding/cards/instagram/wet-sanding-options-to-minimize-airborne-dust-dustless-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/23/wet-sanding-options-to-minimize-airborne-dust-dustless-sanding/cards/pinterest/wet-sanding-options-to-minimize-airborne-dust-dustless-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/23/wet-sanding-options-to-minimize-airborne-dust-dustless-sanding/cards/pinterest/wet-sanding-options-to-minimize-airborne-dust-dustless-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/23/wet-sanding-options-to-minimize-airborne-dust-dustless-sanding/cards/pinterest/wet-sanding-options-to-minimize-airborne-dust-dustless-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/23/wet-sanding-options-to-minimize-airborne-dust-dustless-sanding/cards/facebook/wet-sanding-options-to-minimize-airborne-dust-dustless-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/23/wet-sanding-options-to-minimize-airborne-dust-dustless-sanding/cards/facebook/wet-sanding-options-to-minimize-airborne-dust-dustless-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/23/wet-sanding-options-to-minimize-airborne-dust-dustless-sanding/cards/facebook/wet-sanding-options-to-minimize-airborne-dust-dustless-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Blend Primer Edges Using A Sponge</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/20/blend-primer-edges-using-a-sponge-sanding-sponge/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/20/blend-primer-edges-using-a-sponge-sanding-sponge/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 13:53:37 +0000</pubDate><category>Sanding Sponges</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-280</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit progression</category><category>joint compound</category><category>dust control</category><description>Learn how to feather primer edges with a sanding sponge for invisible transitions.

&lt;p&gt;It’s early, the light is low, and an uneven patch on your wall catches a grazing beam of sun. You prepped the area last night—filled a hairline crack, primed the spot, and stepped away feeling done. But this morning, the primer edge telegraphs a hard line no topcoat could hide. If you’ve been here before, you know the difference between a near miss and a seamless finish comes down to one modest tool: a sanding sponge. Not just any abrasive will do. Foam-backed abrasives deliver conformal contact, edge control, and repeatable scratch patterns you can trust. They turn an obvious patch into a clean gradient that vanishes under paint.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/10.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/20/blend-primer-edges-using-a-sponge-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/blend-primer-edges-using-a-sponge-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/20/blend-primer-edges-using-a-sponge-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/blend-primer-edges-using-a-sponge-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/20/blend-primer-edges-using-a-sponge-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/blend-primer-edges-using-a-sponge-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/20/blend-primer-edges-using-a-sponge-sanding-sponge/cards/instagram/blend-primer-edges-using-a-sponge-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/20/blend-primer-edges-using-a-sponge-sanding-sponge/cards/instagram/blend-primer-edges-using-a-sponge-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/20/blend-primer-edges-using-a-sponge-sanding-sponge/cards/instagram/blend-primer-edges-using-a-sponge-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/20/blend-primer-edges-using-a-sponge-sanding-sponge/cards/pinterest/blend-primer-edges-using-a-sponge-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/20/blend-primer-edges-using-a-sponge-sanding-sponge/cards/pinterest/blend-primer-edges-using-a-sponge-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/20/blend-primer-edges-using-a-sponge-sanding-sponge/cards/pinterest/blend-primer-edges-using-a-sponge-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/20/blend-primer-edges-using-a-sponge-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/blend-primer-edges-using-a-sponge-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/20/blend-primer-edges-using-a-sponge-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/blend-primer-edges-using-a-sponge-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/20/blend-primer-edges-using-a-sponge-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/blend-primer-edges-using-a-sponge-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Identify Raised Nibs Before Sanding</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/17/identify-raised-nibs-before-sanding-between-coats-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/17/identify-raised-nibs-before-sanding-between-coats-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jan 2026 14:58:48 +0000</pubDate><category>Between-Coats Sanding</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>dry sanding</category><category>orbital sander</category><description>Learn to identify raised nibs before sanding between coats for flawless finishes.

&lt;p&gt;You set the brush down and step back. The tabletop glows under the shop lights, a fresh coat catching reflections like still water. Then you see them—tiny flecks interrupting the gloss, little bumps that snag your eye and threaten the silky-smooth finish you pictured. They’re not big flaws, just dust nibs and bits of raised grain, but you know the truth: if you sand them wrong, you’ll chase scratches, burn through edges, or trap grit that will telegraph through every coat after.

&lt;p&gt;The first time you watch dusk turn your road into a tunnel of glare, you realize how much clarity lives in the small things. Haze, pitting, and a cataract-like film build slowly on headlight lenses until the world looks permanently overexposed. You pull into the garage, set a bucket by the bumper, and stare at a stack of wet-dry papers—silicon carbide sheets curling slightly at the edges. You’ve polished paint before, maybe even cut orange peel out of clear coat, but lenses are different. They’re optically functional components. Every scratch you leave behind scatters photons that should have stayed focused on the road. This is why prep matters. And one deceptively simple choice—how long to soak wet-dry papers before lens sanding—will decide whether you cut cleanly with predictable scratch geometry or fight galling, loading, and inconsistent finish all evening.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/23.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/15/how-long-to-soak-wet-dry-papers-before-lens-sanding-lens-sanding/cards/facebook/how-long-to-soak-wet-dry-papers-before-lens-sanding-lens-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/15/how-long-to-soak-wet-dry-papers-before-lens-sanding-lens-sanding/cards/facebook/how-long-to-soak-wet-dry-papers-before-lens-sanding-lens-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/15/how-long-to-soak-wet-dry-papers-before-lens-sanding-lens-sanding/cards/facebook/how-long-to-soak-wet-dry-papers-before-lens-sanding-lens-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/15/how-long-to-soak-wet-dry-papers-before-lens-sanding-lens-sanding/cards/instagram/how-long-to-soak-wet-dry-papers-before-lens-sanding-lens-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/15/how-long-to-soak-wet-dry-papers-before-lens-sanding-lens-sanding/cards/instagram/how-long-to-soak-wet-dry-papers-before-lens-sanding-lens-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/15/how-long-to-soak-wet-dry-papers-before-lens-sanding-lens-sanding/cards/instagram/how-long-to-soak-wet-dry-papers-before-lens-sanding-lens-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/15/how-long-to-soak-wet-dry-papers-before-lens-sanding-lens-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-long-to-soak-wet-dry-papers-before-lens-sanding-lens-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/15/how-long-to-soak-wet-dry-papers-before-lens-sanding-lens-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-long-to-soak-wet-dry-papers-before-lens-sanding-lens-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/15/how-long-to-soak-wet-dry-papers-before-lens-sanding-lens-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-long-to-soak-wet-dry-papers-before-lens-sanding-lens-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/15/how-long-to-soak-wet-dry-papers-before-lens-sanding-lens-sanding/cards/facebook/how-long-to-soak-wet-dry-papers-before-lens-sanding-lens-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/15/how-long-to-soak-wet-dry-papers-before-lens-sanding-lens-sanding/cards/facebook/how-long-to-soak-wet-dry-papers-before-lens-sanding-lens-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/15/how-long-to-soak-wet-dry-papers-before-lens-sanding-lens-sanding/cards/facebook/how-long-to-soak-wet-dry-papers-before-lens-sanding-lens-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Vacuum And Rinse Workflow On Boats</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/06/vacuum-and-rinse-workflow-on-boats-boat-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/06/vacuum-and-rinse-workflow-on-boats-boat-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 14:41:08 +0000</pubDate><category>Marine Sanding</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>Engineer-tested vacuum and rinse workflow for boat sanding—tools, setup, and tips to control dust and slurry, protect gelcoat, and finish faster.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="boat-sanding-vacuum-and-rinse-workflow-that-works"&gt;Boat Sanding: Vacuum and Rinse Workflow That Works&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A still marina at sunrise, dew on the rails, and a hull that shows every hour of sun and salt—this is when the work feels personal. It’s also when mistakes cost the most. I’ve stood under boats where a random-orbit sander turned a calm morning into a chalky blizzard, and I’ve also seen a hull rinsed so haphazardly that the rinse water dragged spent abrasive deep into pores, staining the gelcoat for days. Boat sanding sounds simple—move through the grits, keep it flat, don’t burn the surface—but the truth is that your vacuum and rinse workflow will make or break finish quality, crew health, and yard compliance.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/22.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/06/vacuum-and-rinse-workflow-on-boats-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/vacuum-and-rinse-workflow-on-boats-boat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/06/vacuum-and-rinse-workflow-on-boats-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/vacuum-and-rinse-workflow-on-boats-boat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/06/vacuum-and-rinse-workflow-on-boats-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/vacuum-and-rinse-workflow-on-boats-boat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/06/vacuum-and-rinse-workflow-on-boats-boat-sanding/cards/instagram/vacuum-and-rinse-workflow-on-boats-boat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/06/vacuum-and-rinse-workflow-on-boats-boat-sanding/cards/instagram/vacuum-and-rinse-workflow-on-boats-boat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/06/vacuum-and-rinse-workflow-on-boats-boat-sanding/cards/instagram/vacuum-and-rinse-workflow-on-boats-boat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/06/vacuum-and-rinse-workflow-on-boats-boat-sanding/cards/pinterest/vacuum-and-rinse-workflow-on-boats-boat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/06/vacuum-and-rinse-workflow-on-boats-boat-sanding/cards/pinterest/vacuum-and-rinse-workflow-on-boats-boat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/06/vacuum-and-rinse-workflow-on-boats-boat-sanding/cards/pinterest/vacuum-and-rinse-workflow-on-boats-boat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/06/vacuum-and-rinse-workflow-on-boats-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/vacuum-and-rinse-workflow-on-boats-boat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/06/vacuum-and-rinse-workflow-on-boats-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/vacuum-and-rinse-workflow-on-boats-boat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/06/vacuum-and-rinse-workflow-on-boats-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/vacuum-and-rinse-workflow-on-boats-boat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Check Clarity Under Strong Lighting</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/check-clarity-under-strong-lighting-resin-polishing/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/check-clarity-under-strong-lighting-resin-polishing/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 15:59:00 +0000</pubDate><category>Resin Polishing</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Master resin polishing and clarity checks under strong lighting with practical steps, inspection setups, and troubleshooting for crystal-clear finishes.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="resin-polishing-how-to-check-clarity-under-light"&gt;Resin Polishing: How to Check Clarity Under Light&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The moment you flip on a bright desk lamp is when the truth comes out. A pendant you poured, sanded, and buffed over a quiet weekend looks flawless under normal room light. But under that focused beam, faint fog appears along the edges. Micro-swirls show up in arcs you didn’t notice before. A tiny speck you thought you removed winks back at you. If you’ve tried resin polishing even a few times, you’ve seen this: strong light is uncompromising. It magnifies every scratch, ripple, and residue, turning a “good” finish into one you’re not quite ready to sign your name to.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/18.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/check-clarity-under-strong-lighting-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/check-clarity-under-strong-lighting-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/check-clarity-under-strong-lighting-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/check-clarity-under-strong-lighting-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/check-clarity-under-strong-lighting-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/check-clarity-under-strong-lighting-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/check-clarity-under-strong-lighting-resin-polishing/cards/instagram/check-clarity-under-strong-lighting-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/check-clarity-under-strong-lighting-resin-polishing/cards/instagram/check-clarity-under-strong-lighting-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/check-clarity-under-strong-lighting-resin-polishing/cards/instagram/check-clarity-under-strong-lighting-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/check-clarity-under-strong-lighting-resin-polishing/cards/pinterest/check-clarity-under-strong-lighting-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/check-clarity-under-strong-lighting-resin-polishing/cards/pinterest/check-clarity-under-strong-lighting-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/check-clarity-under-strong-lighting-resin-polishing/cards/pinterest/check-clarity-under-strong-lighting-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/check-clarity-under-strong-lighting-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/check-clarity-under-strong-lighting-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/check-clarity-under-strong-lighting-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/check-clarity-under-strong-lighting-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/check-clarity-under-strong-lighting-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/check-clarity-under-strong-lighting-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Wet Sanding Plastics To Control Dust</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 15:17:50 +0000</pubDate><category>Plastic &amp; Epoxy Sanding</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-280</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>dust control</category><category>dry sanding</category><category>orbital sander</category><category>sanding block</category><description>Wet-sand plastics without the mess.

&lt;p&gt;You know that moment when you pick up a 3D‑printed part or an acrylic panel and see the tiny ridges, support nubs, and swirl marks catching the light? That’s when I head to the sink or a tray and set up for wet sanding. I’ve spent years making surfaces behave—wood, composites, plastics—and here’s the truth: wet sanding plastics is the calm, controlled path to a finish you can sign your name to. And the best tricks I learned polishing resin pours and doing epoxy sanding apply beautifully here—steady pressure, smart grit climbs, and keeping abrasives clean so they cut instead of smear.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/16.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding/cards/instagram/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding/cards/instagram/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding/cards/instagram/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding/cards/pinterest/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding/cards/pinterest/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding/cards/pinterest/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Use Soft Interface Pad For Curved Areas</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/04/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/04/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jan 2026 13:34:57 +0000</pubDate><category>Waterproof &amp; Wet/Dry Paper</category><category>grit-280</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-1200</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>orbital sander</category><description>Master curved-surface sanding with soft interface pads and wet dry sandpaper.

&lt;p&gt;The first time you chase a flawless finish across a curving fender, a hand-turned wooden bowl, or the bell of an aluminum bike frame, you learn quickly that flat-surface habits don’t translate. On a crown or complex radius, the surface fights back—edges burn through, pressure spikes leave troughs, and scratches creep in from directions you didn’t intend. The instinct is to push harder or switch to a coarser abrasive; the better move is to refine the contact mechanics. This is where a soft interface pad and properly chosen wet dry sandpaper change the game. Together, they transform an unpredictable contour into a controllable contact patch, preserving geometry while delivering consistent cut and uniform scratch.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/12.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/04/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/04/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/04/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/04/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/instagram/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/04/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/instagram/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/04/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/instagram/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/04/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/04/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/04/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/04/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/04/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/04/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Film Backed Ceramics For Uniform Scratch</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jan 2026 15:06:46 +0000</pubDate><category>Ceramic &amp; Premium Abrasives</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-280</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>dust control</category><category>clear coat</category><description>Learn how film-backed ceramic sanding discs deliver a uniform scratch pattern with better cut and control.

&lt;p&gt;You notice it first in the light. That telltale halo that appears when you shift the panel under a shop lamp, the swirl that refuses to quit even after another pass with the sander. Maybe it’s a cabinet door you’ve been nursing back to life, a car fender in primer that has to be perfect for color, or a guitar body on its third clear coat. You’re not chasing shine yet—you’re chasing uniformity. A clean, even scratch pattern is the quiet foundation of every flawless finish, and when it isn’t there, everything downstream becomes harder: filler prints through, paint mottles, topcoats telegraph the tiniest inconsistencies. The solution often starts earlier than we think—at the abrasive itself.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/10.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Da Sander Versus Random Orbital For Bodywork Preparation</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/25/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/25/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 13:37:54 +0000</pubDate><category>Auto Body Sanding</category><category>grit-40</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>orbital sander</category><description>Engineering review of DA vs RO sanding for car bodywork, with test data on removal rates, finish quality, abrasives, and cost to help you prep panels right.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="da-vs-ro-sanding-for-auto-bodywork-prep"&gt;DA vs RO sanding for Auto Bodywork Prep&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a cool Saturday morning, I wheeled a dented fender onto the stand, grabbed coffee, and stared at two sanders: a pneumatic 6-inch “DA” hanging from the air line, and a compact 5-inch corded random orbital sitting on the bench. The car—an aging hatchback—had a blend of bare metal, polyester filler, and feathered edges where clearcoat met primer. This is the exact moment many DIYers and even pros face: DA vs RO sanding for bodywork prep. You’re not choosing a philosophy; you’re choosing a process that affects dust control, scratch depth, shape fidelity, and the time you’ll spend chasing pigtails or re-spraying primer. I’ve felt the allure of the faster-cutting DA when leveling filler, and I’ve also learned the hard way that an aggressive orbit can tunnel through primer on a convex edge in seconds.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/03.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/25/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding/cards/facebook/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/25/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding/cards/facebook/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/25/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding/cards/facebook/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/25/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding/cards/instagram/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/25/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding/cards/instagram/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/25/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding/cards/instagram/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/25/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding/cards/pinterest/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/25/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding/cards/pinterest/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/25/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding/cards/pinterest/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/25/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding/cards/facebook/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/25/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding/cards/facebook/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/25/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding/cards/facebook/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Film Versus Paper Backing With Grains</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 17:25:57 +0000</pubDate><category>Abrasive Materials &amp; Compounds</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><description>Film vs paper sandpaper backings explained with grain choices like silicon carbide, plus pro tips for wet/dry sanding and flawless finishes.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="film-vs-paper-backing-with-silicon-carbide-sandpaper"&gt;Film vs Paper Backing with Silicon Carbide Sandpaper&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday mornings in the shop start the same for me: kettle on, soft sun across the bench, and a project at that satisfying almost-there stage. I’d been chasing a glass-flat finish on a walnut desk with an epoxy river, and the last pass was fighting me—tiny swirls that only showed in raking light. I’d been sanding wet to keep dust down, but the paper kept going mushy at the edges. That’s when I swapped in film-backed silicon carbide sandpaper I’d stashed for auto body work. The difference was immediate: the sheet kept its shape, water beaded and carried the swarf away, and the scratch pattern evened out in a few clean passes. The surface went quiet—no chatter, just controlled cutting.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/10.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/instagram/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/instagram/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/instagram/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Keep Heat Low To Prevent Softening</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 17 Dec 2025 14:27:08 +0000</pubDate><category>Plastic &amp; Epoxy Sanding</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>wet sanding</category><description>Engineer-tested guide to epoxy sanding without softening.

&lt;p&gt;The room is quiet except for the soft whirr of a 5-inch random orbital sander. You’ve invested hours pouring a resin river through a slab of maple, watched the swirl of pigment lock under crystal clarity, and now you’re finally leveling the surface for that glass-smooth finish. Then it happens—under the pad, the epoxy feels different. The sander drags, the dust turns to smeary ribbons, and the finish dulls into a gummy haze. If you’ve experienced that sinking feeling, you’ve already met the enemy of precision finishing: heat buildup.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/29.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding/cards/instagram/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding/cards/instagram/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding/cards/instagram/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding/cards/pinterest/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding/cards/pinterest/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding/cards/pinterest/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Reduce Polishing Time With Fine Films</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 17 Dec 2025 13:38:35 +0000</pubDate><category>Specialty Abrasives</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-1200</category><category>grit-2000</category><description>Cut polishing time with microfinishing film.

&lt;p&gt;A Sunday evening shop quiets in that special way it does when the last coat finally flashes off. The blade you’ve ground all afternoon catches a line of light on the bench—almost there, but not quite. The scratch from the coarse stage is still telegraphing through, a shallow arc that you can feel more than see. You have two choices: keep chasing it with the same field-worn abrasive, or change the game. This is where microfinishing film earns its keep. With a stable, flat backing and precisely graded minerals, you can push the finish forward predictably instead of gambling time on inconsistent paper or tired belts. That predictability is what shaves hours, not minutes, from a polishing day.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/27.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film/cards/facebook/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film/cards/facebook/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film/cards/facebook/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film/cards/instagram/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film/cards/instagram/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film/cards/instagram/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film/cards/pinterest/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film/cards/pinterest/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film/cards/pinterest/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film/cards/facebook/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film/cards/facebook/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film/cards/facebook/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>When To Drop Back A Grit To Fix Defects</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/15/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/15/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 15 Dec 2025 13:46:21 +0000</pubDate><category>Grit Range &amp; Classification</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><description>Practical rules and tests to know when to drop back sandpaper grit to remove defects without over-sanding, from wood and resin to automotive clear coat.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="when-to-drop-back-sandpaper-grit-to-fix-defects"&gt;When to Drop Back Sandpaper Grit to Fix Defects&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning. Coffee cooling on the bench, raking light cutting across your project like a truth serum. You wanted a quick scuff-and-recoat—thirty minutes, tops. Instead, the panel keeps whispering back at you: that line near the edge, the mysterious dull patch that won’t clear, the faint spiral that appears only at a certain angle. You switch sheets, then pressure, then motion, but the micro-scratches stubbornly telegraph through. It’s the universal moment where your patience meets physics: do you keep climbing up the sequence or drop back a sandpaper grit to reset the scratch pattern?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/21.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/15/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/15/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/15/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/15/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit/cards/instagram/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/15/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit/cards/instagram/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/15/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit/cards/instagram/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/15/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit/cards/pinterest/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/15/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit/cards/pinterest/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/15/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit/cards/pinterest/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/15/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/15/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/15/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Best Grits For Leveling Primer</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 12 Dec 2025 14:45:24 +0000</pubDate><category>PSA Discs</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-500</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>clear coat</category><category>wet sanding</category><description>Engineer-tested guide to the best grits for leveling primer.

&lt;p&gt;Saturday mornings in my garage start with coffee, a quiet radio, and a panel that still holds a map of yesterday’s imperfections. The primer is flat gray, but under a raking light you can read it like topography—little ridges around a dent repair, faint peel from a heavy pass, and that one shallow wave you only see when you step back. I’ve learned that this is where the paint job is actually won or lost, not in the clear coat. And the tools matter: the block, the sander orbit, the mineral in the abrasive, even the adhesive that bonds the disc. When I swapped to psa sanding discs on a rigid interface for the first “leveling” cut, I noticed two things right away—straighter panels and fewer surprises after sealer.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/13.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Tack Cloth And Vacuum Steps After Scuff Sanding</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 17:33:26 +0000</pubDate><category>Between-Coats Sanding</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>dust control</category><category>clear coat</category><description>Engineer-tested steps for between coats sanding: how to vacuum, tack, and scuff for flawless finishes without dust nibs or witness lines.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="between-coats-sanding-with-tack-cloth-and-vacuum"&gt;Between Coats Sanding with Tack Cloth and Vacuum&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first time I cared about finish quality was on a cold Saturday, kneeling on a drop cloth, cradling a cabinet door that looked perfect—until light from the window slid across it. That raking beam turned gentle amber into a topography of dust nibs, witness lines, and a faint, scratchy haze. I’d rushed the cleaning between scuff passes and relied on a single wipe with an old T‑shirt. The result was predictable in hindsight: dust trapped in clear coat, uneven adhesion, and a finish that only looked good under dim light. That afternoon I learned what every disciplined finisher knows: between coats sanding isn’t about aggression—it’s about control.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/26.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding/cards/instagram/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding/cards/instagram/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding/cards/instagram/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding/cards/pinterest/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding/cards/pinterest/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding/cards/pinterest/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Apply Dry Guide Coat Evenly Over Primer Before Blocking</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2025 13:40:28 +0000</pubDate><category>Auto Body Sanding</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-500</category><category>grit-600</category><category>dust control</category><description>Learn how to apply a dry guide coat evenly over primer and block panels with precision.

&lt;p&gt;The shop is quiet except for the hiss of air through a regulator and the faint tick of cooling metal. You’ve just laid down a uniform film of high-build primer on a long quarter panel, the kind with a subtle crown that punishes any lapse in technique. Under raking LEDs, the surface looks good—flat at a glance, gray and matte like it should. But you know better. Until you perform disciplined guide coat sanding, there’s no honest way to read the surface. The panel has its history: tap-down marks from the last round of metalwork, a skim of filler you were careful not to overshape, and a featheredge that transitions into OEM finish along the dogleg. If any area is slightly low, the topcoat will amplify it like a megaphone.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/16.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding/cards/facebook/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding/cards/facebook/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding/cards/facebook/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding/cards/instagram/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding/cards/instagram/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding/cards/instagram/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding/cards/pinterest/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding/cards/pinterest/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding/cards/pinterest/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding/cards/facebook/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding/cards/facebook/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding/cards/facebook/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>13</readingTime></item><item><title>Wrap Sandpaper Around Dowels For Curved Edges</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 05 Dec 2025 13:37:54 +0000</pubDate><category>Hand Sanding Techniques</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Practical guide to hand sanding curved edges by wrapping sandpaper around dowels; testing abrasives, grits, and jigs for consistent radii.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="hand-sanding-curves-wrap-paper-around-dowels"&gt;Hand Sanding Curves: Wrap Paper Around Dowels&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember the first time a curve made me question my craft. It was a walnut keepsake box with a lid that looked perfect on CAD: a soft 10 mm radius running cleanly along all four edges. On the bench, though, the radius fought back. My block sander flattened the apex, my random-orbit sander skated off the edge, and every “shortcut” I tried left flats and chatter marks that showed up under finish like neon. I finally reached for the simplest tool in the shop: a hardwood dowel, a strip of abrasive, and my hands. With careful hand sanding—wrapping the paper around a dowel that matched the profile—the radius began to read as a continuous curve instead of a sequence of mistakes. The tactile feedback told me where the high spots were; the scratch pattern told me when I was pushing too hard.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/02.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding/cards/instagram/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding/cards/instagram/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding/cards/instagram/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding/cards/pinterest/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding/cards/pinterest/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding/cards/pinterest/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Open Coat Versus Closed Coat Impacts</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 13:41:49 +0000</pubDate><category>Abrasive Materials &amp; Compounds</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-1200</category><description>Open vs closed coat sanding explained with lab-tested data.

&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning in the shop is supposed to be simple: one mug of coffee, a walnut desktop to final-sand, and a couple of hours of quiet before the house wakes up. Instead, at pass number fifteen, the paper glazes over. The dust lines smear into the grain, and the sander’s pitch changes—a small but telling protest. I switch sheets, still chasing that consistent, haze-free scratch pattern. When I move to wet-sand a lacquer test panel, silicon carbide sandpaper comes out of the drawer—its black grit and smooth backing a distinct contrast to the tan aluminum oxide I’ve used on the walnut. Ten minutes later, I’m flattening a glued-up end-grain cutting board, then stepping over to clean up a steel plane body. Same sander, same operator, but suddenly my results diverge depending on one detail I often overlook: how densely the abrasive grains were packed onto the paper in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/23.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/instagram/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/instagram/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/instagram/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Reduce Chipping With Light Pressure</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 01 Dec 2025 17:57:57 +0000</pubDate><category>Glass &amp; Ceramics Sanding</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-1200</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>Learn glass sanding techniques to prevent chipping.

&lt;p&gt;The first clink is always the loudest. You set the pane on a padded bench, nudge it into square, and that tiny tick of glass on glass makes your shoulders tense. If you’ve worked with glass—bottles you’ve upcycled, aquarium panels you’ve drilled, a mirror you’ve cut—you know the feeling. The fear isn’t shattering; it’s those sneaky micro-chips that show up right when you’re almost done. The good news is we can control them. With glass sanding done right and a feather-light touch, you’ll get clean edges that don’t snowflake into chips, even under stress.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/17.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding/cards/instagram/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding/cards/instagram/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding/cards/instagram/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding/cards/pinterest/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding/cards/pinterest/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding/cards/pinterest/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/reduce-chipping-with-light-pressure-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Refine To 2000–3000 For Quick Polish</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 01 Dec 2025 15:17:23 +0000</pubDate><category>Plastic &amp; Epoxy Sanding</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>Master epoxy sanding from 800 to 2000–3000 grit for a fast, haze-free polish with pro-level technique, abrasives, and workflow control.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="epoxy-sanding-quick-polish-at-20003000-grit"&gt;Epoxy Sanding: Quick Polish at 2000–3000 Grit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You set the project down with both hands, the way you place a full coffee mug on a brand-new table—carefully, like it could bruise. Yesterday it was a cloudy slab: dust nibs, tiny ripples, a faint orange peel. Today, it’s close. Under the shop LEDs, you can already see straight lines in the reflection, but not a perfect mirror—still a little fog, still a couple of shallow witness lines that your eyes keep returning to. The moment is tempting: grab a compound and try to bully the gloss into existence. But you’ve done this long enough to know that shine doesn’t come from polish alone; it’s earned in the scratch pattern. This is where epoxy sanding decides whether you’ll be buffing for minutes or for hours, whether the finish will hold up in sunlight or betray you with haloed swirls.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/13.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding/cards/instagram/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding/cards/instagram/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding/cards/instagram/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding/cards/pinterest/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding/cards/pinterest/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding/cards/pinterest/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>When To Choose Trizact Style Abrasives</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 01 Dec 2025 13:40:34 +0000</pubDate><category>Specialty Abrasives</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Learn when to choose Trizact style abrasives vs microfinishing film.

&lt;p&gt;The shop is quiet in the way only focused work can create—overhead lights humming, a small radio whispering in the corner, and the soft, steady rasp of a belt skimming steel. You’ve shaped a kitchen knife from bar stock, or maybe you’re prepping a classic car panel after welding in a patch. The hard work is done, but the finish is still miles away from what you picture: clean, even, and confident. You swap belts, try a different disc, lighten pressure, and still those stubborn lines hang on. Do you step to a more aggressive grit? Switch to a finer one? Or change the abrasive altogether?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/11.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film/cards/instagram/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film/cards/instagram/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film/cards/instagram/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film/cards/pinterest/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film/cards/pinterest/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film/cards/pinterest/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Sponge Versus Paper On Curved Surfaces</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 15:39:58 +0000</pubDate><category>Sanding Sponges</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>grit progression</category><category>sanding block</category><category>dust control</category><description>Learn when a sanding sponge outperforms paper on curves.

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve ever stood in your garage at 9 p.m., holding a cup of coffee with one hand and a carved table leg with the other, you know the moment: the curve looks great until you touch it with the wrong abrasive. Flat spots appear, sharp lines soften, and suddenly the piece loses the crisp profile you loved. I’ve been there countless times—chair arms, bowl rims, crown molding returns—each one begging for finesse. The first time I switched from paper to a sanding sponge mid-project, it felt like I’d finally turned down the static and could hear the wood speaking again. The foam hugged the profile, didn’t dig in, and let me smooth without erasing detail.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/22.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge/cards/instagram/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge/cards/instagram/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge/cards/instagram/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge/cards/pinterest/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge/cards/pinterest/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge/cards/pinterest/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>13</readingTime></item><item><title>Light Sanding To Improve Adhesion Between Coats</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 14:39:05 +0000</pubDate><category>Between-Coats Sanding</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>dust control</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>Engineer’s guide to between coats sanding for stronger adhesion, right grits, abrasives, and timing.

&lt;p&gt;The first coat looked flawless under the shop lights. A fresh panel of maple, sealed in gloss, catching reflections like glass. Then morning sunlight cut through the window and told the truth: a constellation of dust nibs and a few faint brush marks the light had spared me the night before. If you’ve been there, you also know the impulse—grab more finish and try to bury the flaws. That almost always backfires. The next coat telegraphs the defects and, worse, may not bond optimally. That’s where the simple ritual of between coats sanding changes everything, not as a punishment, but as an engineering control.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/12.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding/cards/instagram/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding/cards/instagram/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding/cards/instagram/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding/cards/pinterest/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding/cards/pinterest/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding/cards/pinterest/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>How To Apply Grain Filler On Open Pore Woods Like Oak</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 21 Nov 2025 13:33:23 +0000</pubDate><category>Furniture Refinishing</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>orbital sander</category><description>Learn precise grain filling for oak: abrasives, sanding workflow, filler selection, and application to achieve a glass-smooth finish on open-pore woods.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="grain-filling-oak-pro-sanding-and-filler-workflow"&gt;Grain Filling Oak: Pro Sanding and Filler Workflow&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a moment every woodworker recognizes: fingertips tracing a new oak tabletop, catching on the earlywood valleys that step across the surface like tiny terraces. Under shop lights, the finish looks glossy, almost perfect—until the raking light at sunrise reveals a topography of pores telegraphing through the film. That’s when grain filling stops being a nice-to-have and becomes a requirement. On open-pore woods like oak, ash, and mahogany, achieving a piano-flat finish asks for a deliberate sequence: correct abrasive selection, controlled scratch management, filler chemistry that matches your topcoat, and disciplined leveling. Skip any step and the pores will betray your shortcuts weeks later.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/23.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling/cards/facebook/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling/cards/facebook/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling/cards/facebook/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling/cards/instagram/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling/cards/instagram/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling/cards/instagram/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling/cards/pinterest/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling/cards/pinterest/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling/cards/pinterest/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling/cards/facebook/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling/cards/facebook/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling/cards/facebook/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Keep Surfaces Wet To Control Heat</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2025 13:37:28 +0000</pubDate><category>Glass &amp; Ceramics Sanding</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-280</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-1200</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>Learn expert glass sanding techniques—why water matters, how to control heat, avoid cracks, and get a flawless edge with safe, practical workshop setups.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="glass-sanding-keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat"&gt;Glass Sanding: Keep Surfaces Wet to Control Heat&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know that afternoon light that hits your workshop just right—sawdust floating like golden confetti, the radio low, a mug ring etched into the bench? That’s where precision starts for me. I remember the first time I tried to smooth a chipped glass shelf salvaged from a vintage cabinet. I treated it like hardwood: dry paper, firm pressure, and a “let’s get this done” pace. Ten minutes in, the edge flashed white, my pad squealed, and the glass pinged with that terrifying, crystalline chatter. I learned fast: glass doesn’t forgive heat. It stores stress the way steel stores spring.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/03.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding/cards/instagram/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding/cards/instagram/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding/cards/instagram/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding/cards/pinterest/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding/cards/pinterest/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding/cards/pinterest/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Choose Pad And Compound For Plastics</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 13:37:22 +0000</pubDate><category>Resin Polishing</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>grit progression</category><category>sanding block</category><category>polishing pads</category><description>Engineer’s guide to resin polishing: pick the right pad and compound for acrylic, polycarbonate, and epoxy.

&lt;p&gt;On a quiet Saturday, I watched a friend slowly lower a buffing pad onto the cloudy edge of his epoxy river table. The coffee mugs had left fine scuffs; sunlight turned them into halos. He’d already tried an all-purpose metal polish and a “universal” wool pad—both grabbed hard, smeared the surface, and left the epoxy warmer than I liked. He looked at me and asked the question I hear weekly: “Which pad and which compound do I actually use for plastics?” It’s an honest question with costly consequences if you guess wrong. Unlike metal paint systems that tolerate a surprising amount of heat and pressure, plastics and cured resins can haze, smear, or stress-craze from a few seconds of the wrong contact.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/01.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/cards/instagram/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/cards/instagram/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/cards/instagram/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/cards/pinterest/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/cards/pinterest/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/cards/pinterest/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>13</readingTime></item><item><title>Step Down Rules To Erase Deep Scratches</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 15 Nov 2025 16:51:30 +0000</pubDate><category>Grit Range &amp; Classification</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><description>Pro techniques for stepping down sandpaper grit to erase deep scratches on wood, metal, and plastic with precise workflows and abrasive selection.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="mastering-sandpaper-grit-for-deep-scratch-removal"&gt;Mastering sandpaper grit for deep scratch removal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first pass felt promising. Under the raking light, your tabletop—once scored by a moving box staple—looked flatter after a few steady minutes with the sander. But as you wipe the dust and the surface flashes under a shop lamp, new lines appear, marching in a tidy, parallel pattern. You didn’t make the damage worse; you simply revealed the truth. Deep scratches are not single defects; they’re profiles with depth, flanks, and torn fibers or gouged metal. Managing that geometry is why sandpaper grit selection and step-down discipline matter as much as the tool in hand.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/20.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit/cards/instagram/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit/cards/instagram/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit/cards/instagram/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit/cards/pinterest/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit/cards/pinterest/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit/cards/pinterest/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Scuff Sand Between Coats With A Sponge</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 14 Nov 2025 06:26:49 +0000</pubDate><category>Sanding Sponges</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><description>Engineer-tested guide to scuff sanding between coats using a sanding sponge—grit, pressure, foam chemistry, and pro tips for flawless finishes.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="how-to-scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sanding-sponge"&gt;How to Scuff Sand Between Coats with a Sanding Sponge&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first coat looked perfect under shop lights—glossy, mirror-like, promising. Then morning sunlight cut across the panel and told the truth: a few dust nibs, a faint orange peel near the edge, and the slightest ripple where the grain lifted. I’ve been there more times than I’ll admit. The urge is to lay on more finish and hope it “levels out,” but finishing rarely rewards wishful thinking. What fixes it—quietly, consistently—is a simple pass with a sanding sponge.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/06.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge/cards/instagram/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge/cards/instagram/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge/cards/instagram/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge/cards/pinterest/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge/cards/pinterest/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge/cards/pinterest/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Choose Cork Or Rubber Blocks For Even Pressure</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 16:32:32 +0000</pubDate><category>Sanding Blocks</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>sanding block</category><description>Decide between cork and rubber sanding block for even pressure.

&lt;p&gt;You feel it before you see it: the drag of abrasive across primer, the subtle chatter in your wrist, the way dust plumes differently at the edge than it does in the center. The project might be a cabinet door with raised panels, an automotive quarter panel wearing its first coat of high-build, or a mid-century tabletop with a veneer you refuse to risk. Regardless of the substrate, the instrument in your hand—a sanding block—is the difference between flat and faceted, between crisp and crowned. When the pressure is wrong, the finish is wrong. The telltale symptoms appear later: telegraphed low spots under gloss, rounded edges where a sharp reveal should live, swirl hazing that refuses to die at the next grit.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/04.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/cards/facebook/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/cards/facebook/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/cards/facebook/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/cards/instagram/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/cards/instagram/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/cards/instagram/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/cards/facebook/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/cards/facebook/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/cards/facebook/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>13</readingTime></item><item><title>Remove Dust Nibs Between Clear Coat Layers</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 14:29:42 +0000</pubDate><category>Between-Coats Sanding</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-500</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>clear coat</category><category>dust control</category><category>wet sanding</category><description>Expert guide to between coats sanding—how to remove dust nibs, choose abrasives, and perfect clear coat finishes with pro-level workflows.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="between-coats-sanding-remove-dust-nibs-in-clear-coats"&gt;between coats sanding: remove dust nibs in clear coats&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A flawless clear coat is more than gloss; it’s the tactile confidence you feel when your hand glides across a panel with zero grit or drag. If you’ve ever stepped back from a gorgeous piece—be it a walnut tabletop, a painted cabinet door, or a guitar body—only to see and feel the specks of dust that settled into the finish, you know the sting. Those tiny dust nibs are an inevitable reality of shop air, static, and curing dynamics. Fortunately, they’re also manageable with disciplined surface prep, controlled technique, and smart abrasive choices. That’s the core of between coats sanding: deliberate, minimal-material removal focused on de-nibbing without compromising film build or clarity.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/25.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding/cards/instagram/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding/cards/instagram/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding/cards/instagram/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding/cards/pinterest/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding/cards/pinterest/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding/cards/pinterest/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Scratch Pattern Control For Metal Panels Before Primer</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2025 15:09:37 +0000</pubDate><category>Metal Polishing &amp; Rust Repair</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><description>Learn expert scratch pattern control for metal panels before primer with step-by-step sanding, tool choices, and troubleshooting from a pro workshop</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="metal-surface-sanding-scratch-control-before-primer"&gt;Metal Surface Sanding: Scratch Control Before Primer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The evening a panel is finally quiet is when the real work begins. You kill the grinder, and suddenly it’s just you, a breath of solvent in the air, and sheet metal that shows everything—every ding mapped by light, every shallow wave you swore wasn’t there in the morning. I’ve been there with a door skin laid across sawhorses, work lamp low and unforgiving, palm testing the temperature of steel that still remembers the sander. This moment decides whether primer becomes a friend that hides your sins or a megaphone that announces every missed step.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/21.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding/cards/facebook/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding/cards/facebook/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding/cards/facebook/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding/cards/instagram/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding/cards/instagram/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding/cards/instagram/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding/cards/pinterest/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding/cards/pinterest/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding/cards/pinterest/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding/cards/facebook/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding/cards/facebook/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding/cards/facebook/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Best Grit To Sand Epoxy Primer Before Filler Or Sealer</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/best-grit-to-sand-epoxy-primer-before-filler-or-sealer-primer-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/best-grit-to-sand-epoxy-primer-before-filler-or-sealer-primer-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2025 05:25:06 +0000</pubDate><category>Auto Body Sanding</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-200</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><description>Learn the best grit to sand epoxy primer before filler or sealer, with pro techniques, workflows, and troubleshooting for a paint-ready surface.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="primer-sanding-grits-for-epoxy-before-filler-or-sealer"&gt;Primer Sanding Grits for Epoxy Before Filler or Sealer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning, the garage door yawns open and the light falls across your project—maybe it’s the fender you’ve wrestled straight after months of small fixes, or a truck hood you promised yourself you’d finish before the weather turns. The radio is low, the coffee is cooling, and the bench is lined with sandpaper packs in every color and number. You know this stage matters: what you do next determines whether your basecoat glides on like glass or telegraphs every ripple, pinhole, and scratch. But there’s a nagging question poised at the edge of the workbench. What grit is right for epoxy right now? Is 80 too coarse, 320 too fine? Where does sealer fit? That’s the difference between a finish you’re proud to show and one you’ll forever see in harsh afternoon light.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/15.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/best-grit-to-sand-epoxy-primer-before-filler-or-sealer-primer-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-to-sand-epoxy-primer-before-filler-or-sealer-primer-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/best-grit-to-sand-epoxy-primer-before-filler-or-sealer-primer-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-to-sand-epoxy-primer-before-filler-or-sealer-primer-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/best-grit-to-sand-epoxy-primer-before-filler-or-sealer-primer-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-to-sand-epoxy-primer-before-filler-or-sealer-primer-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/best-grit-to-sand-epoxy-primer-before-filler-or-sealer-primer-sanding/cards/instagram/best-grit-to-sand-epoxy-primer-before-filler-or-sealer-primer-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/best-grit-to-sand-epoxy-primer-before-filler-or-sealer-primer-sanding/cards/instagram/best-grit-to-sand-epoxy-primer-before-filler-or-sealer-primer-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/best-grit-to-sand-epoxy-primer-before-filler-or-sealer-primer-sanding/cards/instagram/best-grit-to-sand-epoxy-primer-before-filler-or-sealer-primer-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/best-grit-to-sand-epoxy-primer-before-filler-or-sealer-primer-sanding/cards/pinterest/best-grit-to-sand-epoxy-primer-before-filler-or-sealer-primer-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/best-grit-to-sand-epoxy-primer-before-filler-or-sealer-primer-sanding/cards/pinterest/best-grit-to-sand-epoxy-primer-before-filler-or-sealer-primer-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/best-grit-to-sand-epoxy-primer-before-filler-or-sealer-primer-sanding/cards/pinterest/best-grit-to-sand-epoxy-primer-before-filler-or-sealer-primer-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/best-grit-to-sand-epoxy-primer-before-filler-or-sealer-primer-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-to-sand-epoxy-primer-before-filler-or-sealer-primer-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/best-grit-to-sand-epoxy-primer-before-filler-or-sealer-primer-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-to-sand-epoxy-primer-before-filler-or-sealer-primer-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/best-grit-to-sand-epoxy-primer-before-filler-or-sealer-primer-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-to-sand-epoxy-primer-before-filler-or-sealer-primer-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Film Backing For Uniform Fine Scratches</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 08 Nov 2025 13:28:53 +0000</pubDate><category>Backing Types &amp; Coatings</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>orbital sander</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>Engineer-tested guidance on film-backed, open coat sandpaper for uniform fine scratches, with data, setups, and grit sequencing tips.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="open-coat-sandpaper-on-film-for-fine-scratches"&gt;Open coat sandpaper on film for fine scratches&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The raking light told the truth I didn’t want to hear. After an hour shaping a walnut desktop, the surface looked perfect under diffuse shop lights—but the morning sun found every swirl and pigtail. I’d sanded carefully, stepped through grits, and kept the pad moving. Still, the micro-scratches telegraphed through as soon as I wiped on mineral spirits. That’s the moment I switched to film-backed abrasives and, crucially, open coat sandpaper for the early and mid-grits. The difference wasn’t subtle; it was measurable.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/instagram/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/instagram/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/instagram/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/film-backing-for-uniform-fine-scratches-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>When To Choose Ceramic Over Sic</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 08 Nov 2025 02:26:28 +0000</pubDate><category>Abrasive Materials &amp; Compounds</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><description>Learn when ceramic abrasives outperform silicon carbide sandpaper for metals, composites, and coatings, with actionable workflows and pro surface-prep tips.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="choosing-ceramic-vs-silicon-carbide-sandpaper"&gt;Choosing Ceramic vs Silicon Carbide Sandpaper&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can hear it before you see it: the sander spins up, the deck light pools across a panel, and the first passes scratch a story into the surface. On a chilly Saturday morning, I’m in a small body shop with two stacks on the cart—one ceramic-oxide disc set, one pile of silicon carbide sandpaper sheets. The job is a split personality: strip rust from a welded bracket, level high-build primer on a fender, then color-sand a fresh clear coat. The wrong abrasive wastes time and ruins finish; the right abrasive turns minutes into clean geometry and predictable gloss. And the smartest choice changes as the substrate, coating, and workflow change.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/instagram/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/instagram/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/instagram/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Progressive Micron Steps For Clarity</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 08 Nov 2025 00:41:16 +0000</pubDate><category>Glass &amp; Ceramics Sanding</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-500</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>Engineer-tested guide to glass sanding using progressive micron steps for optical clarity, with media choices, wet technique, and polishing workflow.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="glass-sanding-progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity"&gt;Glass Sanding: Progressive Micron Steps for Clarity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You notice it first at breakfast—the way the morning light breaks into a haze across your coffee table. A scratch the length of a paperclip sits dead center, scattering highlights into a milky halo that wasn’t there last week. You run a fingernail across it. The catch is slight, but it’s there. It’s the same story with a watch crystal that met a brick wall one hurried afternoon, or a window panel that’s accumulated fine swirls from years of cleaning. Replacing glass is one option, but it’s expensive, wasteful, and impractical for built-ins. As a product engineer who spends an unreasonable amount of time testing abrasives, I prefer another route: controlled, progressive glass sanding that restores optical clarity rather than hides damage.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding/cards/instagram/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding/cards/instagram/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding/cards/instagram/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding/cards/pinterest/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding/cards/pinterest/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding/cards/pinterest/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Let Epoxy Cure Fully Before Sanding</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 07 Nov 2025 16:25:05 +0000</pubDate><category>Plastic &amp; Epoxy Sanding</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-360</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit progression</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>Learn why letting epoxy fully cure before sanding is essential, plus timelines, tests, grit progressions, and pro tips for flawless, clear finishes.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="epoxy-sanding-why-waiting-to-cure-pays-off"&gt;Epoxy Sanding: Why Waiting to Cure Pays Off&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a point in every resin project when anticipation and restraint collide. You’ve de‑molded a river board you poured last weekend or set down a glossy flood coat on a tabletop, and the surface is whispering promises of glass-like clarity. You picture the final reveal: the light catching the grain, the resin depth turning everyday moments into a small ceremony. You also see the last mile between what is and what could be—the smoothing, refining, and polishing phase—also known as epoxy sanding. Your hands ache to pick up the sander. But this is where patience protects your craftsmanship.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding/cards/instagram/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding/cards/instagram/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding/cards/instagram/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding/cards/pinterest/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding/cards/pinterest/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding/cards/pinterest/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Soap To Water Ratio For Lubrication</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 07 Nov 2025 14:24:10 +0000</pubDate><category>Waterproof &amp; Wet/Dry Paper</category><category>grit-360</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-1200</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-2500</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>sanding block</category><description>Engineer-tested soap-to-water ratios for lubricating wet dry sandpaper on paint, wood, and metal.

&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning, a quiet garage, and a project you’ve promised yourself you’d finally finish. The headlight lenses are foggy. The table top has those telltale dust nibs in the polyurethane. A chef’s knife hangs dull on the magnetic strip, begging for bite. You fill a bucket, reach for a bottle of soap, and lay out sheets of wet dry sandpaper—ready to get to work. And then you pause. How much soap should actually go into the water? One drop? A teaspoon? More? You’ve heard “soapy water helps it glide,” but glide isn’t the only variable that matters. There’s also bite, swarf transport, scratch control, and heat. The soap-to-water ratio dictates whether you refine fast and clean—or skate on a film that kills cutting speed and blurs feedback.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/instagram/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/instagram/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/instagram/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Washable Sanding Sponges For Longer Life</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 05 Nov 2025 16:30:43 +0000</pubDate><category>Sanding Sponges</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><description>Extend abrasive life with washable sanding sponges.

&lt;p&gt;You can hear it before you feel it: that faint change in pitch as a loaded abrasive skates across the surface rather than cutting it. In a small garage shop on a drizzly Saturday, a cabinetmaker pauses mid-pass, lifting his sanding sponge to the light. The face is clogged with a pale paste—sawdust and finish residue compacted into the foam’s pores. He hasn’t even reached final grit, but the cutting action is gone and heat is creeping in. In the past, this was when he would toss the sponge and reach for a new one, the cost quietly accumulating with every project. Today, he walks to the sink, rinses the sponge under lukewarm water, massages the face with a nylon brush, and watches the slurry shed away. Thirty seconds later, the abrasive bites again, the cut is cool and even, and the workflow stays on tempo.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge/cards/instagram/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge/cards/instagram/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge/cards/instagram/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge/cards/pinterest/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge/cards/pinterest/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge/cards/pinterest/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Keep Surfaces Flat With Rigid Blocks</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 05 Nov 2025 15:23:32 +0000</pubDate><category>Sanding Blocks</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>sanding block</category><description>Learn how rigid sanding blocks keep surfaces flat, when to use them, and the techniques, materials, and tips that deliver flawless, true results.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="keep-surfaces-flat-with-a-rigid-sanding-block"&gt;Keep Surfaces Flat with a Rigid Sanding Block&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a moment in any refinishing project when your eye catches the light just right and you see it: subtle waves in a tabletop, a faint ripple in primer, a break in the reflections across a glossy guitar body. You feel it with your fingertips too—those barely-there rises and dips that make the difference between “good enough” and “crafted.” I remember the first time I noticed how my results changed when I switched from a soft pad to a rigid sanding block. The surface I thought was “close” suddenly told the truth. Within a few careful passes, the highs dulled evenly and the lows showed as untouched pencil marks. In minutes, the surface was flatter than I’d ever achieved before.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/cards/facebook/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/cards/facebook/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/cards/facebook/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/cards/instagram/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/cards/instagram/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/cards/instagram/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/cards/facebook/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/cards/facebook/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/cards/facebook/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>13</readingTime></item><item><title>Best Grit For Sanding Between Coats Of Polyurethane</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 05 Nov 2025 04:59:16 +0000</pubDate><category>Between-Coats Sanding</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>dry sanding</category><category>clear coat</category><category>sanding block</category><description>Learn the best grit for sanding between coats of polyurethane, when to sand, and how to get a flawless, dust-free finish with pro-tested techniques.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="between-coats-sanding-best-grit-for-polyurethane"&gt;Between Coats Sanding: Best Grit for Polyurethane&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first time you run your hand across a newly finished table and feel the faint drag of tiny dust nibs, you understand why the small steps matter. Maybe it’s a maple dining top you’ve been nursing through long evenings, or a simple pine shelf that somehow carries outsized meaning. You’ve brushed on a smooth coat, waited patiently, and yet—under a raking light—tiny specks wink back at you like a constellation you didn’t intend to draw. That’s the moment when many projects turn from “good enough” to “I want this perfect.” And the bridge to perfect is almost always between coats sanding.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding/cards/instagram/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding/cards/instagram/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding/cards/instagram/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding/cards/pinterest/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding/cards/pinterest/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding/cards/pinterest/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Best Wet Sanding Sequence For Plastic Headlight Lenses</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 05 Nov 2025 03:51:43 +0000</pubDate><category>Headlight Restoration</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-1200</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-2500</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>A precise, technical guide to wet lens sanding for plastic headlights—abrasives, workflows, and UV protection to restore clear, durable optics.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="best-lens-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlights"&gt;Best Lens Sanding Sequence for Plastic Headlights&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twilight is the worst time to discover your headlights are lying to you. Streetlights smear into blurry halos; lane markers fade into a matte wash. You feel yourself leaning forward in the seat as if posture could coax more lumens from the housings. But the problem isn’t the bulb; it’s the lens. Polycarbonate oxidizes, turns porous, and grows a diffuse surface that scatters light instead of transmitting it. That’s fixable if you stop thinking of restoration as a wipe-on miracle and start treating it like precision surface engineering. This guide is about real lens sanding—structured, wet, and sequential—not guessing with a single pad until it “looks better.”&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding/cards/facebook/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding/cards/facebook/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding/cards/facebook/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding/cards/instagram/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding/cards/instagram/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding/cards/instagram/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding/cards/pinterest/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding/cards/pinterest/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding/cards/pinterest/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding/cards/facebook/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding/cards/facebook/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding/cards/facebook/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Proper Panel Degreasing Before Sanding And Painting</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/proper-panel-degreasing-before-sanding-and-painting-car-surface-prep/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/proper-panel-degreasing-before-sanding-and-painting-car-surface-prep/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 05 Nov 2025 00:02:33 +0000</pubDate><category>Auto Body Sanding</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>paint prep</category><category>dust control</category><description>Learn proper panel degreasing for car surface prep: the solvents, steps, and shop tips to avoid fisheyes and get paint to stick like it should.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="car-surface-prep-proper-panel-degreasing"&gt;Car Surface Prep: Proper Panel Degreasing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning, shop door cracked open, coffee perched on the fender, and a faint citrus-solvent smell in the air. That’s the moment I love most: quiet, focused, and full of possibility. You tape off the trim, set your DA sander on the cart, and reach for a clean set of nitrile gloves. If you’ve ever laid down a base coat only to watch it crater into fisheyes or peel at the edges, you know the pain of skipping a step in car surface prep. Most of the time the culprit isn’t your gun, your paint, or the weather—it’s contamination that never should have made it to the paint stage.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/proper-panel-degreasing-before-sanding-and-painting-car-surface-prep/cards/facebook/proper-panel-degreasing-before-sanding-and-painting-car-surface-prep.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/proper-panel-degreasing-before-sanding-and-painting-car-surface-prep/cards/facebook/proper-panel-degreasing-before-sanding-and-painting-car-surface-prep.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/proper-panel-degreasing-before-sanding-and-painting-car-surface-prep/cards/facebook/proper-panel-degreasing-before-sanding-and-painting-car-surface-prep.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/proper-panel-degreasing-before-sanding-and-painting-car-surface-prep/cards/instagram/proper-panel-degreasing-before-sanding-and-painting-car-surface-prep.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/proper-panel-degreasing-before-sanding-and-painting-car-surface-prep/cards/instagram/proper-panel-degreasing-before-sanding-and-painting-car-surface-prep.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/proper-panel-degreasing-before-sanding-and-painting-car-surface-prep/cards/instagram/proper-panel-degreasing-before-sanding-and-painting-car-surface-prep.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/proper-panel-degreasing-before-sanding-and-painting-car-surface-prep/cards/pinterest/proper-panel-degreasing-before-sanding-and-painting-car-surface-prep.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/proper-panel-degreasing-before-sanding-and-painting-car-surface-prep/cards/pinterest/proper-panel-degreasing-before-sanding-and-painting-car-surface-prep.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/proper-panel-degreasing-before-sanding-and-painting-car-surface-prep/cards/pinterest/proper-panel-degreasing-before-sanding-and-painting-car-surface-prep.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/proper-panel-degreasing-before-sanding-and-painting-car-surface-prep/cards/facebook/proper-panel-degreasing-before-sanding-and-painting-car-surface-prep.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/proper-panel-degreasing-before-sanding-and-painting-car-surface-prep/cards/facebook/proper-panel-degreasing-before-sanding-and-painting-car-surface-prep.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/proper-panel-degreasing-before-sanding-and-painting-car-surface-prep/cards/facebook/proper-panel-degreasing-before-sanding-and-painting-car-surface-prep.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>How To Sand Crown Molding Profiles Without Flattening</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 04 Nov 2025 16:44:08 +0000</pubDate><category>Trim &amp; Molding Sanding</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>sanding block</category><category>primer coat</category><category>dust control</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Learn how to sand crown molding without flattening profiles.

&lt;p&gt;On a quiet Saturday morning, you finally pull the drop cloths over your living room floor and tilt a lamp toward the ceiling. The crown molding looks elegant from a distance, but up close the paint has chipped at the corners and the once-crisp beads have gone a little blurry. You run a fingertip along a cove that should feel like a clean arc, and instead it’s a soft bump. That’s the moment when most DIYers decide to sand—and the moment many profiles lose their sharp character. The goal isn’t to erase the molding’s shape; it’s to refine the surface. With a thoughtful approach to molding sanding, you can keep each flare, bead, and cove true while preparing for a flawless new finish.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding/cards/instagram/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding/cards/instagram/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding/cards/instagram/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>How To Sand Wood By Hand For Smooth Finish</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 04 Nov 2025 03:41:00 +0000</pubDate><category>Hand Sanding Techniques</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>sanding block</category><category>grit progression</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>Learn hand sanding techniques, grit progression, and pro tips to achieve a flawless smooth wood finish with clear steps, tools, and troubleshooting.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="hand-sanding-for-a-glass-smooth-wood-finish"&gt;Hand sanding for a glass-smooth wood finish&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a quiet Saturday morning, the house is still enough to hear the tiny rasp of paper against wood. Sunlight falls across the table you’ve promised to restore—the one that’s been gathering keys, grocery bags, and happy-hour mail for years. At first glance, it seems fine. But run your fingertips from the center to the edge and you can feel a map of dents, glue drips, and faint chatter lines left by the last sander. This is where patience matters. This is where hand sanding earns its reputation.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding/cards/instagram/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding/cards/instagram/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding/cards/instagram/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Sand Gelcoat Before Repairs Or Coating</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/sand-gelcoat-before-repairs-or-coating-boat-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/sand-gelcoat-before-repairs-or-coating-boat-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 23:56:18 +0000</pubDate><category>Marine Sanding</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-280</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-600</category><category>dry sanding</category><category>dust control</category><category>wet sanding</category><description>Engineer-tested guide to boat sanding gelcoat for repairs or recoating: grits, tools, wet vs dry, adhesion science, and step-by-step prep.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="boat-sanding-for-gelcoat-repairs-prep-and-technique"&gt;Boat sanding for gelcoat repairs: prep and technique&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The morning wind riffles the marina flags as you step onto the dock with a sander in one hand and masking tape in the other. Yesterday’s chop left salt crystals on the rails; last season left a constellation of nicks in the gelcoat, a chalky haze along the topsides, and the faint outline of old repairs. It’s tempting to rush straight to coating—one more layer to hide the blemishes—but that only traps problems under gloss. The difference between a repair that lasts one season and one that lasts a decade starts long before the roller hits the pan. It starts with boat sanding done with intention.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/sand-gelcoat-before-repairs-or-coating-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/sand-gelcoat-before-repairs-or-coating-boat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/sand-gelcoat-before-repairs-or-coating-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/sand-gelcoat-before-repairs-or-coating-boat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/sand-gelcoat-before-repairs-or-coating-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/sand-gelcoat-before-repairs-or-coating-boat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/sand-gelcoat-before-repairs-or-coating-boat-sanding/cards/instagram/sand-gelcoat-before-repairs-or-coating-boat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/sand-gelcoat-before-repairs-or-coating-boat-sanding/cards/instagram/sand-gelcoat-before-repairs-or-coating-boat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/sand-gelcoat-before-repairs-or-coating-boat-sanding/cards/instagram/sand-gelcoat-before-repairs-or-coating-boat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/sand-gelcoat-before-repairs-or-coating-boat-sanding/cards/pinterest/sand-gelcoat-before-repairs-or-coating-boat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/sand-gelcoat-before-repairs-or-coating-boat-sanding/cards/pinterest/sand-gelcoat-before-repairs-or-coating-boat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/sand-gelcoat-before-repairs-or-coating-boat-sanding/cards/pinterest/sand-gelcoat-before-repairs-or-coating-boat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/sand-gelcoat-before-repairs-or-coating-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/sand-gelcoat-before-repairs-or-coating-boat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/sand-gelcoat-before-repairs-or-coating-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/sand-gelcoat-before-repairs-or-coating-boat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/sand-gelcoat-before-repairs-or-coating-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/sand-gelcoat-before-repairs-or-coating-boat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Use Diamond Or Sic For Glass Edges</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 23:29:24 +0000</pubDate><category>Glass &amp; Ceramics Sanding</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-280</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1200</category><category>grit-2500</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>wet sanding</category><description>Technical guide to glass sanding for chip‑free edges using diamond or SiC abrasives, with grit sequences, coolant control, and polishing workflows.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="glass-sanding-for-clean-safe-edges-diamond-vs-sic"&gt;Glass sanding for clean, safe edges: diamond vs SiC&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The moment you lift a freshly cut pane, you feel it: the edge that looks fine from arm’s length but carries invisible threats—micro-chips, stress risers, and the slight granular drag under a fingertip that says the finish is not ready for handling. Anyone who has ever fit a glass shelf, framed a museum-grade print, or repurposed a bottle knows that the edge is where projects succeed or fail. That’s where glass sanding earns its keep. Thoughtful abrasive selection and disciplined technique turn a risky raw cut into a safe, optically clean edge that won’t shed fragments, haze, or propagate cracks under load. Whether you’re tuning a small arris for furniture-grade touch or chasing an optical polish on a laminated panel, the goal is the same: remove damage quickly, control heat, and leave a tight subsurface that won’t surprise you months later.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding/cards/instagram/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding/cards/instagram/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding/cards/instagram/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding/cards/pinterest/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding/cards/pinterest/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding/cards/pinterest/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>14</readingTime></item><item><title>Polish Epoxy Resin To Glass Like Finish</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 21:00:08 +0000</pubDate><category>Resin Polishing</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-1500</category><description>Learn how to polish epoxy resin to a glass-like finish with step-by-step sanding, heat control, compounds, and pro tips for durable clarity.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="resin-polishing-for-a-glass-like-epoxy-finish"&gt;Resin Polishing for a Glass-Like Epoxy Finish&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first time you run a fingertip across an epoxy surface, it’s a little magic trick. The light catches, colors bloom, and you expect the kind of clarity you see on showroom glass. But if you’ve poured, leveled, and cured resin yourself, you also know the moment that follows: under sunlight or a raking lamp, faint haze, scratch patterns, or tiny undulations whisper that the job isn’t quite done. That’s where resonant craftsmanship meets patience—where resin polishing turns a good pour into a gleaming, glass-like finish.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing/cards/instagram/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing/cards/instagram/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing/cards/instagram/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing/cards/pinterest/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing/cards/pinterest/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing/cards/pinterest/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>14</readingTime></item><item><title>Avoid Loading With Stearated Papers</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 20:47:55 +0000</pubDate><category>Plastic &amp; Epoxy Sanding</category><category>grit-280</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>dust control</category><category>grit progression</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>Master epoxy sanding without clogging.

&lt;p&gt;You know the moment: the shop is quiet, the resin river table catches morning light, and all you can see are tiny ridges, dust nibs, and a faint orange peel across that once-glassy pour. This is where projects are made—or marred. Epoxy sanding isn’t glamorous, but it’s the step that decides if your final finish looks like a mirror or a fogged window. And if you’ve ever had sandpaper load up in seconds, smear epoxy into gummy streaks, or clog your discs so fast you start doubting your gear, you’re not alone. I’ve been there—hands on the sander, vac humming, wondering why the surface keeps fighting back.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding/cards/instagram/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding/cards/instagram/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding/cards/instagram/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding/cards/pinterest/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding/cards/pinterest/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding/cards/pinterest/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Soak Time For Wet Sanding Papers</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 19:47:57 +0000</pubDate><category>Waterproof &amp; Wet/Dry Paper</category><category>grit-280</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-1200</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>wet sanding</category><description>Learn the optimal soak times for wet dry sandpaper, how soaking affects abrasive performance, and precise workflows for wood, paint, and metal.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="wet-dry-sandpaper-soak-times-a-technical-guide"&gt;Wet Dry Sandpaper Soak Times: A Technical Guide&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shop is quiet except for the slow drip from a rinse bottle, pooling across a workbench where a clear-coated guitar body breathes under the lights. There’s a shallow tray of clean water, a few folded sheets of wet dry sandpaper, and a foam pad waiting like a promise. You press a fingertip to the lacquer—weeks of curing have left it hard, crisp, and unforgiving. You remember the last time you rushed the process and chased pigtails under a glaring shop light. Not today.

&lt;p&gt;The moment you flip on a bright desk lamp is when the truth comes out. A pendant you poured, sanded, and buffed over a quiet weekend looks flawless under normal room light. But under that focused beam, faint fog appears along the edges. Micro-swirls show up in arcs you didn’t notice before. A tiny speck you thought you removed winks back at you. If you’ve tried resin polishing even a few times, you’ve seen this: strong light is uncompromising. It magnifies every scratch, ripple, and residue, turning a “good” finish into one you’re not quite ready to sign your name to.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/18.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/check-clarity-under-strong-lighting-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/check-clarity-under-strong-lighting-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/check-clarity-under-strong-lighting-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/check-clarity-under-strong-lighting-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/check-clarity-under-strong-lighting-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/check-clarity-under-strong-lighting-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/check-clarity-under-strong-lighting-resin-polishing/cards/instagram/check-clarity-under-strong-lighting-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/check-clarity-under-strong-lighting-resin-polishing/cards/instagram/check-clarity-under-strong-lighting-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/check-clarity-under-strong-lighting-resin-polishing/cards/instagram/check-clarity-under-strong-lighting-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/check-clarity-under-strong-lighting-resin-polishing/cards/pinterest/check-clarity-under-strong-lighting-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/check-clarity-under-strong-lighting-resin-polishing/cards/pinterest/check-clarity-under-strong-lighting-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/check-clarity-under-strong-lighting-resin-polishing/cards/pinterest/check-clarity-under-strong-lighting-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/check-clarity-under-strong-lighting-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/check-clarity-under-strong-lighting-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/check-clarity-under-strong-lighting-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/check-clarity-under-strong-lighting-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/check-clarity-under-strong-lighting-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/check-clarity-under-strong-lighting-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Wet Sanding Plastics To Control Dust</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 15:17:50 +0000</pubDate><category>Plastic &amp; Epoxy Sanding</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-280</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>dust control</category><category>dry sanding</category><category>orbital sander</category><category>sanding block</category><description>Wet-sand plastics without the mess.

&lt;p&gt;You know that moment when you pick up a 3D‑printed part or an acrylic panel and see the tiny ridges, support nubs, and swirl marks catching the light? That’s when I head to the sink or a tray and set up for wet sanding. I’ve spent years making surfaces behave—wood, composites, plastics—and here’s the truth: wet sanding plastics is the calm, controlled path to a finish you can sign your name to. And the best tricks I learned polishing resin pours and doing epoxy sanding apply beautifully here—steady pressure, smart grit climbs, and keeping abrasives clean so they cut instead of smear.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/16.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding/cards/instagram/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding/cards/instagram/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding/cards/instagram/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding/cards/pinterest/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding/cards/pinterest/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding/cards/pinterest/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/wet-sanding-plastics-to-control-dust-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Use Soft Interface Pad For Curved Areas</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/04/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/04/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jan 2026 13:34:57 +0000</pubDate><category>Waterproof &amp; Wet/Dry Paper</category><category>grit-280</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-1200</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>orbital sander</category><description>Master curved-surface sanding with soft interface pads and wet dry sandpaper.

&lt;p&gt;The first time you chase a flawless finish across a curving fender, a hand-turned wooden bowl, or the bell of an aluminum bike frame, you learn quickly that flat-surface habits don’t translate. On a crown or complex radius, the surface fights back—edges burn through, pressure spikes leave troughs, and scratches creep in from directions you didn’t intend. The instinct is to push harder or switch to a coarser abrasive; the better move is to refine the contact mechanics. This is where a soft interface pad and properly chosen wet dry sandpaper change the game. Together, they transform an unpredictable contour into a controllable contact patch, preserving geometry while delivering consistent cut and uniform scratch.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/12.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/04/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/04/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/04/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/04/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/instagram/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/04/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/instagram/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/04/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/instagram/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/04/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/04/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/04/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/04/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/04/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/04/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/use-soft-interface-pad-for-curved-areas-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Reduce Polishing Time With Fine Films</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 17 Dec 2025 13:38:35 +0000</pubDate><category>Specialty Abrasives</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-1200</category><category>grit-2000</category><description>Cut polishing time with microfinishing film.

&lt;p&gt;A Sunday evening shop quiets in that special way it does when the last coat finally flashes off. The blade you’ve ground all afternoon catches a line of light on the bench—almost there, but not quite. The scratch from the coarse stage is still telegraphing through, a shallow arc that you can feel more than see. You have two choices: keep chasing it with the same field-worn abrasive, or change the game. This is where microfinishing film earns its keep. With a stable, flat backing and precisely graded minerals, you can push the finish forward predictably instead of gambling time on inconsistent paper or tired belts. That predictability is what shaves hours, not minutes, from a polishing day.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/27.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film/cards/facebook/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film/cards/facebook/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film/cards/facebook/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film/cards/instagram/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film/cards/instagram/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film/cards/instagram/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film/cards/pinterest/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film/cards/pinterest/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film/cards/pinterest/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film/cards/facebook/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film/cards/facebook/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film/cards/facebook/reduce-polishing-time-with-fine-films-microfinishing-film.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Avoid Edge Burn Through While Wet Sanding</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/16/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/16/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 14:26:25 +0000</pubDate><category>Waterproof &amp; Wet/Dry Paper</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>clear coat</category><category>mirror finish</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>sanding block</category><description>Learn how to avoid edge burn-through while wet sanding using wet dry sandpaper, smart pressure control, and safe techniques around panels and body lines.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="avoid-edge-burn-through-with-wet-dry-sandpaper"&gt;Avoid Edge Burn-Through with Wet Dry Sandpaper&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday light pools across the driveway. Your project—clear coat mottled with orange peel and a few dust nibs—waits patiently. You’ve gathered your bucket, a soft block, and a stack of wet dry sandpaper sheets, promising yourself you’ll go slow and do it right this time. The first passes are almost meditative: water beads, slurry darkens, and the surface gradually evens out. Then, edging along a fender crease, your heart stutters—you feel it grab. One careless swipe, one ounce too much pressure, and suddenly the gloss gives way to dull haze. You squeegee and look closer. A whisper of primer peeks through at the ridge.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/25.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/16/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/16/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/16/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/16/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/instagram/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/16/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/instagram/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/16/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/instagram/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/16/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/16/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/16/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/16/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/16/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/16/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/avoid-edge-burn-through-while-wet-sanding-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Denibbing With Ultra Fine Sponge Abrasives</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 11 Dec 2025 14:14:40 +0000</pubDate><category>Sanding Sponges</category><category>grit-280</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>mirror finish</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>dry sanding</category><category>clear coat</category><category>dust control</category><description>Learn denibbing with ultra fine sponge abrasives.

&lt;p&gt;The shop was quiet except for the gentle hum of the dust extractor and the tick of cooling lights. I’d just laid the final coat on a black cabinet door—high-gloss lacquer, deep and mirror-like. It looked perfect under the booth lamps… until I rolled it into raking light. There they were: tiny raised specks scattered like stars—dust nibs. No drama, no panic. I’ve been here before. This is where an ultra fine sanding sponge earns its keep. It doesn’t scream for attention like a sander or a buffer; it just quietly, precisely knocks down the dots that ruin a perfect finish.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/07.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge/cards/instagram/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge/cards/instagram/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge/cards/instagram/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge/cards/pinterest/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge/cards/pinterest/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge/cards/pinterest/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Finish Out Micro Marring And Haze</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 10 Dec 2025 13:42:22 +0000</pubDate><category>Polishing &amp; Finishing</category><category>mirror finish</category><category>polishing pads</category><category>grit progression</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>clear coat</category><description>Learn how to finish out micro marring and haze using polishing sandpaper, pads, and polish.

&lt;p&gt;It’s 9 p.m., the shop lights are humming, and the panel you’ve been nursing all day looks perfect—until you hit it with a tight, cool LED beam. There it is: a faint cloudy halo that follows the light like a shadow. Micro marring. Haze. It doesn’t ruin a job, but it steals the depth that makes a finish sing. I’ve seen it a thousand times—after wet sanding runs, after cutting with a heavy compound, even after a rushed “final” pass. The good news is you can bring the gloss back. You just need the right sequence, the right pressure, and (yes) the right polishing sandpaper so every step sets up the next.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/28.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper/cards/instagram/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper/cards/instagram/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper/cards/instagram/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/finish-out-micro-marring-and-haze-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>When To Choose 2000 Versus 3000 Grit For Clear Refining</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/when-to-choose-2000-versus-3000-grit-for-clear-refining-2000-3000-grit-wet-sandi/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/when-to-choose-2000-versus-3000-grit-for-clear-refining-2000-3000-grit-wet-sandi/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2025 14:35:11 +0000</pubDate><category>Wet Sanding Clear Coat</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>clear coat</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>Engineer’s guide to choosing 2000 vs 3000 grit for wet sanding clear.

&lt;p&gt;On a clear autumn morning I watched a black coupe roll into our test bay, its hood shimmering in early light—beautiful from five meters, troubling at fifty centimeters. The owner had tried to fix a few nibs and orange peel with a single pass of 3000 grit, then compounded. The result was a glossy mirror with a faint gray cast in the sun and a couple of nibs still telegraphing through. I’ve seen the inverse too: a shop tech leveling clear with 2000, only to chase out deep sanding marks all afternoon because the paint had cured hard and the compound wasn’t cutting efficiently. Both scenarios point to the same decision inflection: picking the right end of the 2000–3000 grit wet sanding range for clear refining.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/18.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/when-to-choose-2000-versus-3000-grit-for-clear-refining-2000-3000-grit-wet-sandi/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-2000-versus-3000-grit-for-clear-refining-2000-3000-grit-wet-sandi.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/when-to-choose-2000-versus-3000-grit-for-clear-refining-2000-3000-grit-wet-sandi/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-2000-versus-3000-grit-for-clear-refining-2000-3000-grit-wet-sandi.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/when-to-choose-2000-versus-3000-grit-for-clear-refining-2000-3000-grit-wet-sandi/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-2000-versus-3000-grit-for-clear-refining-2000-3000-grit-wet-sandi.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/when-to-choose-2000-versus-3000-grit-for-clear-refining-2000-3000-grit-wet-sandi/cards/instagram/when-to-choose-2000-versus-3000-grit-for-clear-refining-2000-3000-grit-wet-sandi.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/when-to-choose-2000-versus-3000-grit-for-clear-refining-2000-3000-grit-wet-sandi/cards/instagram/when-to-choose-2000-versus-3000-grit-for-clear-refining-2000-3000-grit-wet-sandi.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/when-to-choose-2000-versus-3000-grit-for-clear-refining-2000-3000-grit-wet-sandi/cards/instagram/when-to-choose-2000-versus-3000-grit-for-clear-refining-2000-3000-grit-wet-sandi.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/when-to-choose-2000-versus-3000-grit-for-clear-refining-2000-3000-grit-wet-sandi/cards/pinterest/when-to-choose-2000-versus-3000-grit-for-clear-refining-2000-3000-grit-wet-sandi.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/when-to-choose-2000-versus-3000-grit-for-clear-refining-2000-3000-grit-wet-sandi/cards/pinterest/when-to-choose-2000-versus-3000-grit-for-clear-refining-2000-3000-grit-wet-sandi.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/when-to-choose-2000-versus-3000-grit-for-clear-refining-2000-3000-grit-wet-sandi/cards/pinterest/when-to-choose-2000-versus-3000-grit-for-clear-refining-2000-3000-grit-wet-sandi.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/when-to-choose-2000-versus-3000-grit-for-clear-refining-2000-3000-grit-wet-sandi/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-2000-versus-3000-grit-for-clear-refining-2000-3000-grit-wet-sandi.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/when-to-choose-2000-versus-3000-grit-for-clear-refining-2000-3000-grit-wet-sandi/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-2000-versus-3000-grit-for-clear-refining-2000-3000-grit-wet-sandi.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/when-to-choose-2000-versus-3000-grit-for-clear-refining-2000-3000-grit-wet-sandi/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-2000-versus-3000-grit-for-clear-refining-2000-3000-grit-wet-sandi.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Avoid Overheating Edges During Polish</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/avoid-overheating-edges-during-polish-resin-polishing/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/avoid-overheating-edges-during-polish-resin-polishing/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 01 Dec 2025 16:10:07 +0000</pubDate><category>Resin Polishing</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>wet sanding</category><description>Engineer-tested methods to keep resin edges cool while polishing.

&lt;p&gt;The first time I overheated a resin edge, it looked perfect—right up until it wasn’t. The surface was glossy, but the perimeter turned milky, then smeared like warm butter under a rotary pad. I could smell the polymer heating. It felt like a setback on a simple task: sanding and finishing a handmade resin coaster. If you’ve been there, you know the mix of frustration and “what did I do wrong?” It’s not lack of care; it’s physics. That edge has less mass to absorb heat, and during resin polishing you’re pushing friction and pressure into a tiny contact patch. Heat has nowhere to go.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/15.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/avoid-overheating-edges-during-polish-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/avoid-overheating-edges-during-polish-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/avoid-overheating-edges-during-polish-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/avoid-overheating-edges-during-polish-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/avoid-overheating-edges-during-polish-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/avoid-overheating-edges-during-polish-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/avoid-overheating-edges-during-polish-resin-polishing/cards/instagram/avoid-overheating-edges-during-polish-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/avoid-overheating-edges-during-polish-resin-polishing/cards/instagram/avoid-overheating-edges-during-polish-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/avoid-overheating-edges-during-polish-resin-polishing/cards/instagram/avoid-overheating-edges-during-polish-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/avoid-overheating-edges-during-polish-resin-polishing/cards/pinterest/avoid-overheating-edges-during-polish-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/avoid-overheating-edges-during-polish-resin-polishing/cards/pinterest/avoid-overheating-edges-during-polish-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/avoid-overheating-edges-during-polish-resin-polishing/cards/pinterest/avoid-overheating-edges-during-polish-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/avoid-overheating-edges-during-polish-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/avoid-overheating-edges-during-polish-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/avoid-overheating-edges-during-polish-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/avoid-overheating-edges-during-polish-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/avoid-overheating-edges-during-polish-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/avoid-overheating-edges-during-polish-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Refine To 2000–3000 For Quick Polish</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 01 Dec 2025 15:17:23 +0000</pubDate><category>Plastic &amp; Epoxy Sanding</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>Master epoxy sanding from 800 to 2000–3000 grit for a fast, haze-free polish with pro-level technique, abrasives, and workflow control.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="epoxy-sanding-quick-polish-at-20003000-grit"&gt;Epoxy Sanding: Quick Polish at 2000–3000 Grit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You set the project down with both hands, the way you place a full coffee mug on a brand-new table—carefully, like it could bruise. Yesterday it was a cloudy slab: dust nibs, tiny ripples, a faint orange peel. Today, it’s close. Under the shop LEDs, you can already see straight lines in the reflection, but not a perfect mirror—still a little fog, still a couple of shallow witness lines that your eyes keep returning to. The moment is tempting: grab a compound and try to bully the gloss into existence. But you’ve done this long enough to know that shine doesn’t come from polish alone; it’s earned in the scratch pattern. This is where epoxy sanding decides whether you’ll be buffing for minutes or for hours, whether the finish will hold up in sunlight or betray you with haloed swirls.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/13.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding/cards/instagram/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding/cards/instagram/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding/cards/instagram/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding/cards/pinterest/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding/cards/pinterest/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding/cards/pinterest/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/refine-to-2000-3000-for-quick-polish-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>When To Choose Trizact Style Abrasives</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 01 Dec 2025 13:40:34 +0000</pubDate><category>Specialty Abrasives</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Learn when to choose Trizact style abrasives vs microfinishing film.

&lt;p&gt;The shop is quiet in the way only focused work can create—overhead lights humming, a small radio whispering in the corner, and the soft, steady rasp of a belt skimming steel. You’ve shaped a kitchen knife from bar stock, or maybe you’re prepping a classic car panel after welding in a patch. The hard work is done, but the finish is still miles away from what you picture: clean, even, and confident. You swap belts, try a different disc, lighten pressure, and still those stubborn lines hang on. Do you step to a more aggressive grit? Switch to a finer one? Or change the abrasive altogether?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/11.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film/cards/instagram/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film/cards/instagram/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film/cards/instagram/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film/cards/pinterest/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film/cards/pinterest/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film/cards/pinterest/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Wet Sanding Sequence 1000 To 3000 Grit</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/30/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/30/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 30 Nov 2025 13:32:41 +0000</pubDate><category>Waterproof &amp; Wet/Dry Paper</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-2500</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>clear coat</category><category>dry sanding</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Learn a pro-approved wet sanding sequence from 1000 to 3000 grit using wet dry sandpaper.

&lt;p&gt;The garage is quiet except for the steady drip from a hose into a plastic pail. You’ve taped off the washer nozzles, masked the edges, and laid out your gear like a surgeon. A foam block, a spray bottle with soapy water, microfiber towels, and a neat stack of wet dry sandpaper—1000, 2000, and 3000 grit—each sheet pre-cut and soaking. If you’ve ever stared at a hood that looked great at sunset but awful under the driveway floodlight—orange peel, dust nibs, faint sanding traces from an old repair—you know the itch to fix it properly. Today’s the day you turn that itch into an even, glassy finish with a controlled wet sanding sequence from 1000 to 3000 grit.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/09.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/30/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/30/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/30/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/30/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/instagram/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/30/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/instagram/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/30/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/instagram/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/30/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/30/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/30/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/30/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/30/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/30/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/wet-sanding-sequence-1000-to-3000-grit-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Best Polishing Sequence After Wet Sanding</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-polishing-sequence-after-wet-sanding-polishing-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-polishing-sequence-after-wet-sanding-polishing-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 16:16:32 +0000</pubDate><category>Polishing &amp; Finishing</category><category>mirror finish</category><category>polishing pads</category><category>grit progression</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>clear coat</category><description>Learn the best polishing sequence after wet sanding.

&lt;p&gt;Picture this: late Saturday, lights humming in the garage, a quiet radio in the background, and the last sheet of wet/dry in your hand. The clear coat is dead-flat from your final passes, but it looks dull and grey—like all the gloss vanished. You run a finger across the panel and the surface feels flawless, almost sticky-smooth. That’s the moment when most DIYers wonder, “Now what?” The answer is a deliberate polishing sequence—and the right polishing sandpaper setup before you even plug in the machine. Whether you’re chasing a mirror finish on a freshly sprayed fender, a varnished guitar body, or a gelcoat corner on a boat hatch, what happens next determines whether you get a show-car sheen or a halo of haze.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/14.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-polishing-sequence-after-wet-sanding-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/best-polishing-sequence-after-wet-sanding-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-polishing-sequence-after-wet-sanding-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/best-polishing-sequence-after-wet-sanding-polishing-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-polishing-sequence-after-wet-sanding-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/best-polishing-sequence-after-wet-sanding-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-polishing-sequence-after-wet-sanding-polishing-sandpaper/cards/instagram/best-polishing-sequence-after-wet-sanding-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-polishing-sequence-after-wet-sanding-polishing-sandpaper/cards/instagram/best-polishing-sequence-after-wet-sanding-polishing-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-polishing-sequence-after-wet-sanding-polishing-sandpaper/cards/instagram/best-polishing-sequence-after-wet-sanding-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-polishing-sequence-after-wet-sanding-polishing-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/best-polishing-sequence-after-wet-sanding-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-polishing-sequence-after-wet-sanding-polishing-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/best-polishing-sequence-after-wet-sanding-polishing-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-polishing-sequence-after-wet-sanding-polishing-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/best-polishing-sequence-after-wet-sanding-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-polishing-sequence-after-wet-sanding-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/best-polishing-sequence-after-wet-sanding-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-polishing-sequence-after-wet-sanding-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/best-polishing-sequence-after-wet-sanding-polishing-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-polishing-sequence-after-wet-sanding-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/best-polishing-sequence-after-wet-sanding-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Why Uv Protective Clear Coat Is Required After Restoration</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 23 Nov 2025 13:28:43 +0000</pubDate><category>Headlight Restoration</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>clear coat</category><category>wet sanding</category><description>Discover why a UV clear coat is vital after restoration.

&lt;p&gt;You know that moment when the shop door rolls up, the morning light hits your freshly restored project, and you catch the reflection—crisp, glassy, and clean? Whether it’s a set of previously cloudy headlights, an oxidized hood you’ve cut and polished, or a faded motorcycle fairing you’ve brought back to life, it feels like breathing new air. I’ve been there on a Saturday morning, rag in one hand, inspection light in the other, admiring that deep clarity. It’s the quiet pride of a job well done. But here’s the tough-love truth: without a UV clear coat to seal that clarity, the sun will start undoing your work the second you roll outside.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/06.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat/cards/facebook/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat/cards/facebook/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat/cards/facebook/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat/cards/instagram/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat/cards/instagram/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat/cards/instagram/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat/cards/pinterest/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat/cards/pinterest/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat/cards/pinterest/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat/cards/facebook/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat/cards/facebook/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/23/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat/cards/facebook/why-uv-protective-clear-coat-is-required-after-restoration-uv-clear-coat.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Full Orange Peel Removal Versus Texture Match To Oem Finish</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/full-orange-peel-removal-versus-texture-match-to-oem-finish-orange-peel-removal/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/full-orange-peel-removal-versus-texture-match-to-oem-finish-orange-peel-removal/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 22 Nov 2025 13:28:52 +0000</pubDate><category>Wet Sanding Clear Coat</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Engineer-tested guide comparing full orange peel removal to OEM texture matching, with measurements, workflows, and tool recommendations.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="orange-peel-removal-vs-oem-texture-match"&gt;Orange Peel Removal vs OEM Texture Match&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You notice it every time the sun breaks through the carport: the hood looks like a clear lake ruffled by a breeze. Not scratched, not dirty—just textured. You run your fingertips across it and feel… nothing. The gloss is there, the reflections are bright, but the lines of your neighbor’s fence warp and shimmer. That’s orange peel. It’s a finish most modern cars ship with on purpose—partly the byproduct of efficient high-solids clearcoats and fast robotic spray passes, partly an aesthetic choice that many automakers prefer for its way of masking minor defects and giving panels a sort of visual “softness.”&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/04.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/full-orange-peel-removal-versus-texture-match-to-oem-finish-orange-peel-removal/cards/facebook/full-orange-peel-removal-versus-texture-match-to-oem-finish-orange-peel-removal.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/full-orange-peel-removal-versus-texture-match-to-oem-finish-orange-peel-removal/cards/facebook/full-orange-peel-removal-versus-texture-match-to-oem-finish-orange-peel-removal.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/full-orange-peel-removal-versus-texture-match-to-oem-finish-orange-peel-removal/cards/facebook/full-orange-peel-removal-versus-texture-match-to-oem-finish-orange-peel-removal.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/full-orange-peel-removal-versus-texture-match-to-oem-finish-orange-peel-removal/cards/instagram/full-orange-peel-removal-versus-texture-match-to-oem-finish-orange-peel-removal.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/full-orange-peel-removal-versus-texture-match-to-oem-finish-orange-peel-removal/cards/instagram/full-orange-peel-removal-versus-texture-match-to-oem-finish-orange-peel-removal.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/full-orange-peel-removal-versus-texture-match-to-oem-finish-orange-peel-removal/cards/instagram/full-orange-peel-removal-versus-texture-match-to-oem-finish-orange-peel-removal.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/full-orange-peel-removal-versus-texture-match-to-oem-finish-orange-peel-removal/cards/pinterest/full-orange-peel-removal-versus-texture-match-to-oem-finish-orange-peel-removal.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/full-orange-peel-removal-versus-texture-match-to-oem-finish-orange-peel-removal/cards/pinterest/full-orange-peel-removal-versus-texture-match-to-oem-finish-orange-peel-removal.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/full-orange-peel-removal-versus-texture-match-to-oem-finish-orange-peel-removal/cards/pinterest/full-orange-peel-removal-versus-texture-match-to-oem-finish-orange-peel-removal.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/full-orange-peel-removal-versus-texture-match-to-oem-finish-orange-peel-removal/cards/facebook/full-orange-peel-removal-versus-texture-match-to-oem-finish-orange-peel-removal.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/full-orange-peel-removal-versus-texture-match-to-oem-finish-orange-peel-removal/cards/facebook/full-orange-peel-removal-versus-texture-match-to-oem-finish-orange-peel-removal.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/full-orange-peel-removal-versus-texture-match-to-oem-finish-orange-peel-removal/cards/facebook/full-orange-peel-removal-versus-texture-match-to-oem-finish-orange-peel-removal.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Cut Rate And Loading Behavior By Grain</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2025 00:57:05 +0000</pubDate><category>Abrasive Materials &amp; Compounds</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>clear coat</category><category>orbital sander</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>Engineer’s guide to silicon carbide sandpaper—cut rate, loading, grain physics, and practical tips to choose the right abrasive for paint, metal, and</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="silicon-carbide-sandpaper-cut-rate-and-loading"&gt;Silicon Carbide Sandpaper: Cut Rate and Loading&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning in the garage, the air smelled faintly of cut clear coat and soapy water. A half-finished motorcycle tank sat on a foam cradle, its orange peel and dust nibs highlighted by a raking LED panel. I’d already tried a few sheets of 1500 grit from a contractor pack, but they stalled after a few passes, loading with milky slurry and leaving stray scratches that would require more polish later. This is the moment that separates a casual sand from a dependable workflow—the point where abrasive choice dictates not just speed, but consistency and finish quality. Swapping to silicon carbide sandpaper felt like a small change, but it reset the process: faster leveling, more controllable scratch patterns, and fewer surprise defects.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/09.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/instagram/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/instagram/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/instagram/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/cut-rate-and-loading-behavior-by-grain-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Choose Pad And Compound For Plastics</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 13:37:22 +0000</pubDate><category>Resin Polishing</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>grit progression</category><category>sanding block</category><category>polishing pads</category><description>Engineer’s guide to resin polishing: pick the right pad and compound for acrylic, polycarbonate, and epoxy.

&lt;p&gt;On a quiet Saturday, I watched a friend slowly lower a buffing pad onto the cloudy edge of his epoxy river table. The coffee mugs had left fine scuffs; sunlight turned them into halos. He’d already tried an all-purpose metal polish and a “universal” wool pad—both grabbed hard, smeared the surface, and left the epoxy warmer than I liked. He looked at me and asked the question I hear weekly: “Which pad and which compound do I actually use for plastics?” It’s an honest question with costly consequences if you guess wrong. Unlike metal paint systems that tolerate a surprising amount of heat and pressure, plastics and cured resins can haze, smear, or stress-craze from a few seconds of the wrong contact.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/01.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/cards/instagram/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/cards/instagram/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/cards/instagram/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/cards/pinterest/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/cards/pinterest/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/cards/pinterest/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>13</readingTime></item><item><title>Choose Wool Foam Or Microfiber Pads</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 16:03:08 +0000</pubDate><category>Polishing &amp; Finishing</category><category>mirror finish</category><category>polishing pads</category><category>grit progression</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-2500</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>clear coat</category><category>sanding block</category><description>Engineer-tested guide to choosing wool, foam, or microfiber pads—and when to pair them with polishing sandpaper—for faster, safer, glossier results.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-with-polishing-sandpaper"&gt;Wool, Foam, or Microfiber Pads with Polishing Sandpaper&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a quiet Saturday morning, you tape off the trim, load your polisher, and stare at the paint under bright LEDs. Swirls dance across the clear coat, with a few deeper scratches that refuse to disappear. You’ve got compounds lined up, pads sorted into neatly labeled bins, and sheets of polishing sandpaper ready if the defects demand leveling. Yet the question lingers: which pad material will get you there fastest, without overheating, over-thinning the clear, or leaving haze to chase?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/27.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper/cards/instagram/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper/cards/instagram/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper/cards/instagram/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Remove Dust Nibs Between Clear Coat Layers</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 14:29:42 +0000</pubDate><category>Between-Coats Sanding</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-500</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>clear coat</category><category>dust control</category><category>wet sanding</category><description>Expert guide to between coats sanding—how to remove dust nibs, choose abrasives, and perfect clear coat finishes with pro-level workflows.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="between-coats-sanding-remove-dust-nibs-in-clear-coats"&gt;between coats sanding: remove dust nibs in clear coats&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A flawless clear coat is more than gloss; it’s the tactile confidence you feel when your hand glides across a panel with zero grit or drag. If you’ve ever stepped back from a gorgeous piece—be it a walnut tabletop, a painted cabinet door, or a guitar body—only to see and feel the specks of dust that settled into the finish, you know the sting. Those tiny dust nibs are an inevitable reality of shop air, static, and curing dynamics. Fortunately, they’re also manageable with disciplined surface prep, controlled technique, and smart abrasive choices. That’s the core of between coats sanding: deliberate, minimal-material removal focused on de-nibbing without compromising film build or clarity.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/25.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding/cards/instagram/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding/cards/instagram/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding/cards/instagram/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding/cards/pinterest/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding/cards/pinterest/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding/cards/pinterest/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Compound Versus Polish To Remove 2000 Grit Sanding Marks</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-to-remove-2000-grit-sanding-marks-plastic-headlight-polis/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-to-remove-2000-grit-sanding-marks-plastic-headlight-polis/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2025 13:37:28 +0000</pubDate><category>Headlight Restoration</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>clear coat</category><description>Engineer’s guide to plastic headlight polishing: compound or polish to remove 2000 grit sanding marks?

&lt;p&gt;The sun wasn’t up yet, but the garage light threw a harsh circle over the hood of a ten-year-old hatchback. I’d taped plastic sheeting around the fenders the night before, masked the trim, and laid out abrasives like a surgeon prepping instruments—400, 600, 2000. Anyone who’s driven at night behind hazed lenses knows that dim, anxious feeling—like the road keeps secrets from you. This morning was about clarity, not just looks. It was about performance. And if you’ve ever tried plastic headlight polishing after sanding to 2000 grit and still seen a spiderweb of marks in the reflection, you know the question lurking at the bottom of the bottle: compound or polish? Both promise clarity. Both spin a story of micro-abrasives and gloss. But which one actually erases the last of those 2000 grit tracks in polycarbonate, and which only glides over them?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/19.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-to-remove-2000-grit-sanding-marks-plastic-headlight-polis/cards/facebook/compound-versus-polish-to-remove-2000-grit-sanding-marks-plastic-headlight-polis.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-to-remove-2000-grit-sanding-marks-plastic-headlight-polis/cards/facebook/compound-versus-polish-to-remove-2000-grit-sanding-marks-plastic-headlight-polis.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-to-remove-2000-grit-sanding-marks-plastic-headlight-polis/cards/facebook/compound-versus-polish-to-remove-2000-grit-sanding-marks-plastic-headlight-polis.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-to-remove-2000-grit-sanding-marks-plastic-headlight-polis/cards/instagram/compound-versus-polish-to-remove-2000-grit-sanding-marks-plastic-headlight-polis.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-to-remove-2000-grit-sanding-marks-plastic-headlight-polis/cards/instagram/compound-versus-polish-to-remove-2000-grit-sanding-marks-plastic-headlight-polis.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-to-remove-2000-grit-sanding-marks-plastic-headlight-polis/cards/instagram/compound-versus-polish-to-remove-2000-grit-sanding-marks-plastic-headlight-polis.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-to-remove-2000-grit-sanding-marks-plastic-headlight-polis/cards/pinterest/compound-versus-polish-to-remove-2000-grit-sanding-marks-plastic-headlight-polis.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-to-remove-2000-grit-sanding-marks-plastic-headlight-polis/cards/pinterest/compound-versus-polish-to-remove-2000-grit-sanding-marks-plastic-headlight-polis.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-to-remove-2000-grit-sanding-marks-plastic-headlight-polis/cards/pinterest/compound-versus-polish-to-remove-2000-grit-sanding-marks-plastic-headlight-polis.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-to-remove-2000-grit-sanding-marks-plastic-headlight-polis/cards/facebook/compound-versus-polish-to-remove-2000-grit-sanding-marks-plastic-headlight-polis.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-to-remove-2000-grit-sanding-marks-plastic-headlight-polis/cards/facebook/compound-versus-polish-to-remove-2000-grit-sanding-marks-plastic-headlight-polis.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-to-remove-2000-grit-sanding-marks-plastic-headlight-polis/cards/facebook/compound-versus-polish-to-remove-2000-grit-sanding-marks-plastic-headlight-polis.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Compound Versus Polish Differences For Clear Coat Finishing</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2025 05:56:37 +0000</pubDate><category>Wet Sanding Clear Coat</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-2500</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>clear coat</category><category>wet sanding</category><description>Understand compound vs polish for clear coat finishing with sanding workflows, abrasive selection, and process control for defect-free paint polishing.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="paint-polishing-compound-vs-polish-for-clear-coat"&gt;Paint polishing: compound vs polish for clear coat&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Saturday morning sun can be the most unforgiving inspector you’ll ever meet. You back the car out after a late-night respray—coffee in hand, optimism high—and the light slices across the hood like a straightedge. Orange peel you knew about, sure. But then the swirls appear, whisper-fine arcs barely visible at dusk now glaring at full volume. You feel them before you see them: the drag of a microfiber catching on texture, the way your eyes follow a ghosty hologram around a curved fender. This is the moment when “wash and wax” ends and craft begins—where surface preparation, abrasive control, and paint polishing decide whether you get a mirror or a mirage.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/17.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing/cards/facebook/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing/cards/facebook/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing/cards/facebook/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing/cards/instagram/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing/cards/instagram/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing/cards/instagram/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing/cards/pinterest/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing/cards/pinterest/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing/cards/pinterest/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing/cards/facebook/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing/cards/facebook/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing/cards/facebook/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>How To Remove Polyurethane Or Varnish Safely From Furniture</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-remove-polyurethane-or-varnish-safely-from-furniture-wood-finish-removal/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-remove-polyurethane-or-varnish-safely-from-furniture-wood-finish-removal/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2025 18:54:49 +0000</pubDate><category>Furniture Refinishing</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit progression</category><category>orbital sander</category><description>Learn safe, practical wood finish removal for furniture—strip polyurethane or varnish without damage.

&lt;p&gt;It starts as a quiet, hopeful Saturday morning. You slide open a drawer on a hand-me-down dresser and the runners squeak just slightly—an honest sound, softened by decades of use. The wood is beautiful under the glare of a shiny, ambered topcoat, but the gloss is cracked in places and the color has drifted toward orange. You imagine this piece lightened, its grain breathing again, ready for a new finish that fits your home today. There’s just one thing between you and that vision: the practical reality of wood finish removal. You’ve heard horror stories about harsh chemicals, gummy messes, and hours of sanding that erase crisp edges. You’ve also heard promises about citrus strippers and miracle gels. Somewhere between the extremes sits a safe, effective path—one that respects both your health and the furniture’s history.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-remove-polyurethane-or-varnish-safely-from-furniture-wood-finish-removal/cards/facebook/how-to-remove-polyurethane-or-varnish-safely-from-furniture-wood-finish-removal.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-remove-polyurethane-or-varnish-safely-from-furniture-wood-finish-removal/cards/facebook/how-to-remove-polyurethane-or-varnish-safely-from-furniture-wood-finish-removal.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-remove-polyurethane-or-varnish-safely-from-furniture-wood-finish-removal/cards/facebook/how-to-remove-polyurethane-or-varnish-safely-from-furniture-wood-finish-removal.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-remove-polyurethane-or-varnish-safely-from-furniture-wood-finish-removal/cards/instagram/how-to-remove-polyurethane-or-varnish-safely-from-furniture-wood-finish-removal.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-remove-polyurethane-or-varnish-safely-from-furniture-wood-finish-removal/cards/instagram/how-to-remove-polyurethane-or-varnish-safely-from-furniture-wood-finish-removal.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-remove-polyurethane-or-varnish-safely-from-furniture-wood-finish-removal/cards/instagram/how-to-remove-polyurethane-or-varnish-safely-from-furniture-wood-finish-removal.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-remove-polyurethane-or-varnish-safely-from-furniture-wood-finish-removal/cards/pinterest/how-to-remove-polyurethane-or-varnish-safely-from-furniture-wood-finish-removal.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-remove-polyurethane-or-varnish-safely-from-furniture-wood-finish-removal/cards/pinterest/how-to-remove-polyurethane-or-varnish-safely-from-furniture-wood-finish-removal.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-remove-polyurethane-or-varnish-safely-from-furniture-wood-finish-removal/cards/pinterest/how-to-remove-polyurethane-or-varnish-safely-from-furniture-wood-finish-removal.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-remove-polyurethane-or-varnish-safely-from-furniture-wood-finish-removal/cards/facebook/how-to-remove-polyurethane-or-varnish-safely-from-furniture-wood-finish-removal.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-remove-polyurethane-or-varnish-safely-from-furniture-wood-finish-removal/cards/facebook/how-to-remove-polyurethane-or-varnish-safely-from-furniture-wood-finish-removal.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-remove-polyurethane-or-varnish-safely-from-furniture-wood-finish-removal/cards/facebook/how-to-remove-polyurethane-or-varnish-safely-from-furniture-wood-finish-removal.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Grit Steps For Honing And Polishing</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/grit-steps-for-honing-and-polishing-concrete-polishing/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/grit-steps-for-honing-and-polishing-concrete-polishing/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 08 Nov 2025 01:11:57 +0000</pubDate><category>Stone &amp; Concrete Polishing</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>dust control</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Learn the exact grit sequences for honing and concrete polishing, from metal-bond cuts to high-gloss finishes, with practical tips and pro-level clarity.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="grit-steps-that-unlock-beautiful-concrete-polishing"&gt;Grit Steps That Unlock Beautiful Concrete Polishing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The café opens just before sunrise, the first light catching on cups and chrome as someone flips the sign to “Open.” Footsteps echo across the floor—once dull, scuffed, and interrupted by patchy coatings. A few weeks ago, the owner debated a full remodel. Instead, she chose a different path: refining what was already there. With a plan centered on careful grit steps, the team ground, honed, and finally achieved a reflective finish through concrete polishing. Now the floor turns light into soft ribbons. It feels new without losing its character; the aggregate tells a story, the surface is smooth, and maintenance is suddenly predictable. People pause when they walk in. They notice the room before they notice the menu.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/grit-steps-for-honing-and-polishing-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/grit-steps-for-honing-and-polishing-concrete-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/grit-steps-for-honing-and-polishing-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/grit-steps-for-honing-and-polishing-concrete-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/grit-steps-for-honing-and-polishing-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/grit-steps-for-honing-and-polishing-concrete-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/grit-steps-for-honing-and-polishing-concrete-polishing/cards/instagram/grit-steps-for-honing-and-polishing-concrete-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/grit-steps-for-honing-and-polishing-concrete-polishing/cards/instagram/grit-steps-for-honing-and-polishing-concrete-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/grit-steps-for-honing-and-polishing-concrete-polishing/cards/instagram/grit-steps-for-honing-and-polishing-concrete-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/grit-steps-for-honing-and-polishing-concrete-polishing/cards/pinterest/grit-steps-for-honing-and-polishing-concrete-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/grit-steps-for-honing-and-polishing-concrete-polishing/cards/pinterest/grit-steps-for-honing-and-polishing-concrete-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/grit-steps-for-honing-and-polishing-concrete-polishing/cards/pinterest/grit-steps-for-honing-and-polishing-concrete-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/grit-steps-for-honing-and-polishing-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/grit-steps-for-honing-and-polishing-concrete-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/grit-steps-for-honing-and-polishing-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/grit-steps-for-honing-and-polishing-concrete-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/grit-steps-for-honing-and-polishing-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/grit-steps-for-honing-and-polishing-concrete-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Progressive Micron Steps For Clarity</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 08 Nov 2025 00:41:16 +0000</pubDate><category>Glass &amp; Ceramics Sanding</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-500</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>Engineer-tested guide to glass sanding using progressive micron steps for optical clarity, with media choices, wet technique, and polishing workflow.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="glass-sanding-progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity"&gt;Glass Sanding: Progressive Micron Steps for Clarity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You notice it first at breakfast—the way the morning light breaks into a haze across your coffee table. A scratch the length of a paperclip sits dead center, scattering highlights into a milky halo that wasn’t there last week. You run a fingernail across it. The catch is slight, but it’s there. It’s the same story with a watch crystal that met a brick wall one hurried afternoon, or a window panel that’s accumulated fine swirls from years of cleaning. Replacing glass is one option, but it’s expensive, wasteful, and impractical for built-ins. As a product engineer who spends an unreasonable amount of time testing abrasives, I prefer another route: controlled, progressive glass sanding that restores optical clarity rather than hides damage.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding/cards/instagram/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding/cards/instagram/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding/cards/instagram/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding/cards/pinterest/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding/cards/pinterest/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding/cards/pinterest/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Remove 1500–2000 Grit Marks On Resin</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 07 Nov 2025 23:56:25 +0000</pubDate><category>Resin Polishing</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-1200</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-2500</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>dust control</category><description>Expert workflows to remove 1500–2000 grit marks on resin and achieve optical clarity with the right abrasives, compounds, and heat control.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="resin-polishing-erasing-15002000-grit-scratches"&gt;Resin Polishing: Erasing 1500–2000 Grit Scratches&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pendant looked flawless on the bench last night—glassy, color suspended in amber, edges softened just so. Then morning light hit it. Under a low-angle window beam, micro-scratches flared across the surface like frost on a windshield. You could feel your shoulders sag. You did the careful wet-sand through 1500 and 2000, kept the strokes even, swirled the slurry away. It should be done. But resin is unforgiving under raking light, and 1500–2000 grit marks hang on, whisper-thin but brutally visible. This is the moment where the craft turns from “sanding” to resin polishing: closing the cut, controlling heat, and stepping the abrasive system with intent until the surface stops being a surface and becomes a reflection.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing/cards/instagram/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing/cards/instagram/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing/cards/instagram/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing/cards/pinterest/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing/cards/pinterest/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing/cards/pinterest/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>9</readingTime></item><item><title>Film Backed Sheets For Uniform Scratch</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/film-backed-sheets-for-uniform-scratch-microfinishing-film/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/film-backed-sheets-for-uniform-scratch-microfinishing-film/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 07 Nov 2025 15:23:44 +0000</pubDate><category>Specialty Abrasives</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>clear coat</category><description>Learn how film-backed microfinishing film sheets deliver uniform scratch patterns with step-by-step techniques, grit selection, and pro tips for flawless</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="microfinishing-film-uniform-scratch-every-time"&gt;Microfinishing Film: Uniform Scratch Every Time&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s late, the shop lights are a soft hum, and you’re chasing a finish that doesn’t lie—flat, even, and honest under any light. I know that moment well: when a part looks good to the naked eye, but under a raking beam the scratch pattern flares in swirls and hot spots. That’s where film backed sheets earn their keep. With microfinishing film, you don’t rely on luck; you rely on controlled, repeatable abrasion that leaves a uniform scratch from corner to corner. It’s the difference between “good enough” and “go ahead, mic it—twice.”&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/film-backed-sheets-for-uniform-scratch-microfinishing-film/cards/facebook/film-backed-sheets-for-uniform-scratch-microfinishing-film.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/film-backed-sheets-for-uniform-scratch-microfinishing-film/cards/facebook/film-backed-sheets-for-uniform-scratch-microfinishing-film.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/film-backed-sheets-for-uniform-scratch-microfinishing-film/cards/facebook/film-backed-sheets-for-uniform-scratch-microfinishing-film.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/film-backed-sheets-for-uniform-scratch-microfinishing-film/cards/instagram/film-backed-sheets-for-uniform-scratch-microfinishing-film.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/film-backed-sheets-for-uniform-scratch-microfinishing-film/cards/instagram/film-backed-sheets-for-uniform-scratch-microfinishing-film.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/film-backed-sheets-for-uniform-scratch-microfinishing-film/cards/instagram/film-backed-sheets-for-uniform-scratch-microfinishing-film.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/film-backed-sheets-for-uniform-scratch-microfinishing-film/cards/pinterest/film-backed-sheets-for-uniform-scratch-microfinishing-film.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/film-backed-sheets-for-uniform-scratch-microfinishing-film/cards/pinterest/film-backed-sheets-for-uniform-scratch-microfinishing-film.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/film-backed-sheets-for-uniform-scratch-microfinishing-film/cards/pinterest/film-backed-sheets-for-uniform-scratch-microfinishing-film.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/film-backed-sheets-for-uniform-scratch-microfinishing-film/cards/facebook/film-backed-sheets-for-uniform-scratch-microfinishing-film.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/film-backed-sheets-for-uniform-scratch-microfinishing-film/cards/facebook/film-backed-sheets-for-uniform-scratch-microfinishing-film.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/film-backed-sheets-for-uniform-scratch-microfinishing-film/cards/facebook/film-backed-sheets-for-uniform-scratch-microfinishing-film.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Soap To Water Ratio For Lubrication</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 07 Nov 2025 14:24:10 +0000</pubDate><category>Waterproof &amp; Wet/Dry Paper</category><category>grit-360</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-1200</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-2500</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>sanding block</category><description>Engineer-tested soap-to-water ratios for lubricating wet dry sandpaper on paint, wood, and metal.

&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning, a quiet garage, and a project you’ve promised yourself you’d finally finish. The headlight lenses are foggy. The table top has those telltale dust nibs in the polyurethane. A chef’s knife hangs dull on the magnetic strip, begging for bite. You fill a bucket, reach for a bottle of soap, and lay out sheets of wet dry sandpaper—ready to get to work. And then you pause. How much soap should actually go into the water? One drop? A teaspoon? More? You’ve heard “soapy water helps it glide,” but glide isn’t the only variable that matters. There’s also bite, swarf transport, scratch control, and heat. The soap-to-water ratio dictates whether you refine fast and clean—or skate on a film that kills cutting speed and blurs feedback.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/instagram/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/instagram/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/instagram/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Remove 2000 Grit Sanding Scratches Efficiently</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/remove-2000-grit-sanding-scratches-efficiently-polishing-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/remove-2000-grit-sanding-scratches-efficiently-polishing-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 05 Nov 2025 05:18:58 +0000</pubDate><category>Polishing &amp; Finishing</category><category>mirror finish</category><category>polishing pads</category><category>grit progression</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>wet sanding</category><description>Learn how to remove 2000-grit sanding scratches fast with precise workflows, polishing sandpaper selection, and pro-level compounding techniques.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="polishing-sandpaper-erasing-2000-grit-scratches"&gt;Polishing Sandpaper: Erasing 2000-Grit Scratches&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a quiet Saturday morning, the garage feels like a studio. The door is up, the sun is low, and the panel you’ve just leveled with 2000-grit wet sanding is a uniform gray haze—deliberate, dense, and a little intimidating. At arm’s length the surface looks flat, but under a raking LED it blooms with tight linear tracks, the signature of controlled abrasion. This is the moment when confidence wavers: did you go too far, or not far enough? If you’ve ever paused and wondered how to erase that texture efficiently—without reintroducing waves, burning edges, or chasing your tail—this guide is for you.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/remove-2000-grit-sanding-scratches-efficiently-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/remove-2000-grit-sanding-scratches-efficiently-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/remove-2000-grit-sanding-scratches-efficiently-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/remove-2000-grit-sanding-scratches-efficiently-polishing-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/remove-2000-grit-sanding-scratches-efficiently-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/remove-2000-grit-sanding-scratches-efficiently-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/remove-2000-grit-sanding-scratches-efficiently-polishing-sandpaper/cards/instagram/remove-2000-grit-sanding-scratches-efficiently-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/remove-2000-grit-sanding-scratches-efficiently-polishing-sandpaper/cards/instagram/remove-2000-grit-sanding-scratches-efficiently-polishing-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/remove-2000-grit-sanding-scratches-efficiently-polishing-sandpaper/cards/instagram/remove-2000-grit-sanding-scratches-efficiently-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/remove-2000-grit-sanding-scratches-efficiently-polishing-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/remove-2000-grit-sanding-scratches-efficiently-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/remove-2000-grit-sanding-scratches-efficiently-polishing-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/remove-2000-grit-sanding-scratches-efficiently-polishing-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/remove-2000-grit-sanding-scratches-efficiently-polishing-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/remove-2000-grit-sanding-scratches-efficiently-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/remove-2000-grit-sanding-scratches-efficiently-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/remove-2000-grit-sanding-scratches-efficiently-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/remove-2000-grit-sanding-scratches-efficiently-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/remove-2000-grit-sanding-scratches-efficiently-polishing-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/remove-2000-grit-sanding-scratches-efficiently-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/remove-2000-grit-sanding-scratches-efficiently-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Best Wet Sanding Sequence For Plastic Headlight Lenses</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 05 Nov 2025 03:51:43 +0000</pubDate><category>Headlight Restoration</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-1200</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-2500</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>A precise, technical guide to wet lens sanding for plastic headlights—abrasives, workflows, and UV protection to restore clear, durable optics.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="best-lens-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlights"&gt;Best Lens Sanding Sequence for Plastic Headlights&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twilight is the worst time to discover your headlights are lying to you. Streetlights smear into blurry halos; lane markers fade into a matte wash. You feel yourself leaning forward in the seat as if posture could coax more lumens from the housings. But the problem isn’t the bulb; it’s the lens. Polycarbonate oxidizes, turns porous, and grows a diffuse surface that scatters light instead of transmitting it. That’s fixable if you stop thinking of restoration as a wipe-on miracle and start treating it like precision surface engineering. This guide is about real lens sanding—structured, wet, and sequential—not guessing with a single pad until it “looks better.”&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding/cards/facebook/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding/cards/facebook/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding/cards/facebook/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding/cards/instagram/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding/cards/instagram/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding/cards/instagram/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding/cards/pinterest/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding/cards/pinterest/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding/cards/pinterest/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding/cards/facebook/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding/cards/facebook/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding/cards/facebook/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Crosshatch Sanding Pattern For Even Clear Coat Leveling</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 05 Nov 2025 00:59:26 +0000</pubDate><category>Wet Sanding Clear Coat</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-2500</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>clear coat</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>sanding block</category><description>Learn the crosshatch sanding pattern for even clear coat leveling—tools, grits, steps, and pro tips for a flat, glossy, mirror-like finish.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="crosshatch-sanding-for-clear-coat-leveling"&gt;Crosshatch Sanding for Clear Coat Leveling&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You notice it first when the sun dips behind a cloud. Your car—or maybe that guitar body you’ve been refinishing—looked perfect in full daylight. But now a soft, diffused glow reveals a faint orange peel, a sprinkling of swirls, and the slightest rippling along a contour line. It’s not ruined, but it’s not the glassy surface you had in mind. The promise of a flawless finish is what pulls many of us into the workshop on a Saturday morning, and it’s what makes techniques like clear coat leveling feel less like a chore and more like craftsmanship. What you need isn’t more product or a heavier hand; it’s a repeatable way to flatten texture without taking unnecessary risks.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling/cards/facebook/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling/cards/facebook/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling/cards/facebook/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling/cards/instagram/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling/cards/instagram/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling/cards/instagram/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling/cards/pinterest/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling/cards/pinterest/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling/cards/pinterest/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling/cards/facebook/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling/cards/facebook/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling/cards/facebook/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Sic Versus Aluminum Oxide Differences</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 04 Nov 2025 02:51:33 +0000</pubDate><category>Abrasive Materials &amp; Compounds</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>dry sanding</category><category>clear coat</category><category>orbital sander</category><category>sanding block</category><description>Compare silicon carbide sandpaper and aluminum oxide to choose the right abrasive for wood, metal, and paint.

&lt;p&gt;On a quiet Saturday afternoon, you clamp down the last door of that heirloom dresser you’ve been restoring. The grain finally shows through the old varnish, but the surface still isn’t the mirror-smooth finish you pictured. You reach for a fresh sheet, feel the grit with your thumb, and hesitate—this is where the choice between silicon carbide sandpaper and aluminum oxide decides whether you’ll spend the evening admiring your work or chasing scratches you didn’t mean to make. Maybe you’re here because a paint finish went cloudy after dry sanding, or a clear coat took a hopscotch of swirls under shop lights. Or maybe your belt sander chewed through hook-and-loop discs like a wood chipper and you need something tougher and more predictable.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/instagram/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/instagram/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/instagram/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/sic-versus-aluminum-oxide-differences-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>13</readingTime></item><item><title>Avoid Loading With Stearated Papers</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 20:47:55 +0000</pubDate><category>Plastic &amp; Epoxy Sanding</category><category>grit-280</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>dust control</category><category>grit progression</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>Master epoxy sanding without clogging.

&lt;p&gt;You know the moment: the shop is quiet, the resin river table catches morning light, and all you can see are tiny ridges, dust nibs, and a faint orange peel across that once-glassy pour. This is where projects are made—or marred. Epoxy sanding isn’t glamorous, but it’s the step that decides if your final finish looks like a mirror or a fogged window. And if you’ve ever had sandpaper load up in seconds, smear epoxy into gummy streaks, or clog your discs so fast you start doubting your gear, you’re not alone. I’ve been there—hands on the sander, vac humming, wondering why the surface keeps fighting back.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding/cards/instagram/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding/cards/instagram/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding/cards/instagram/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding/cards/pinterest/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding/cards/pinterest/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding/cards/pinterest/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Soak Time For Wet Sanding Papers</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 19:47:57 +0000</pubDate><category>Waterproof &amp; Wet/Dry Paper</category><category>grit-280</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-1200</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>wet sanding</category><description>Learn the optimal soak times for wet dry sandpaper, how soaking affects abrasive performance, and precise workflows for wood, paint, and metal.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="wet-dry-sandpaper-soak-times-a-technical-guide"&gt;Wet Dry Sandpaper Soak Times: A Technical Guide&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shop is quiet except for the slow drip from a rinse bottle, pooling across a workbench where a clear-coated guitar body breathes under the lights. There’s a shallow tray of clean water, a few folded sheets of wet dry sandpaper, and a foam pad waiting like a promise. You press a fingertip to the lacquer—weeks of curing have left it hard, crisp, and unforgiving. You remember the last time you rushed the process and chased pigtails under a glaring shop light. Not today. Today, the water will do its work before the first stroke lands.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/instagram/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/instagram/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/instagram/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper/cards/facebook/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Difference Between Compounding And Polishing</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 02:16:29 +0000</pubDate><category>Polishing &amp; Finishing</category><category>mirror finish</category><category>polishing pads</category><category>grit progression</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-1200</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>clear coat</category><description>Learn the difference between compounding and polishing, how to choose polishing sandpaper and pads, and the step-by-step process for flawless finishes.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="compounding-vs-polishing-guide-to-polishing-sandpaper"&gt;Compounding vs Polishing: Guide to Polishing Sandpaper&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a moment every craftsperson recognizes: you step into the garage or studio, sunlight cuts across a painted panel or tabletop, and you see everything—swirls you never meant to leave, scratches that catch the light just so, a haze that dulls the color you spent hours applying. Your instinct might be to reach for the strongest product you own, but knowing the difference between compounding and polishing—and where polishing sandpaper fits—can save time, material, and the finish you’re trying to protect. Maybe it’s the clear coat on your daily driver, the lacquer on a guitar body, or the resin on a turned pen blank. Different surfaces, same goal: remove defects while preserving as much material as possible.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper/cards/instagram/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper/cards/instagram/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper/cards/instagram/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper/cards/facebook/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item></channel></rss>

&lt;p&gt;I still remember the first time I had to prep eight maple drawer fronts and two weldments on a Friday night, trying to get everything out the door before a client walk-through. The random orbital ran steady, but the pace was brutal: discs glazed, edges burned, and I found myself swapping aluminum oxide sheets every few minutes. The bin filled up with used paper; the floor filled with dust. It felt like death by a thousand micro-clogs. That night I started running side-by-side trials with ceramic sanding discs. I wanted to know if the higher sticker price was justified or just clever marketing.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/13.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/11/cost-per-job-comparison-ceramic-vs-ao-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/cost-per-job-comparison-ceramic-vs-ao-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/11/cost-per-job-comparison-ceramic-vs-ao-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/cost-per-job-comparison-ceramic-vs-ao-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/11/cost-per-job-comparison-ceramic-vs-ao-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/cost-per-job-comparison-ceramic-vs-ao-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/11/cost-per-job-comparison-ceramic-vs-ao-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/cost-per-job-comparison-ceramic-vs-ao-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/11/cost-per-job-comparison-ceramic-vs-ao-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/cost-per-job-comparison-ceramic-vs-ao-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/11/cost-per-job-comparison-ceramic-vs-ao-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/cost-per-job-comparison-ceramic-vs-ao-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/11/cost-per-job-comparison-ceramic-vs-ao-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/cost-per-job-comparison-ceramic-vs-ao-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/11/cost-per-job-comparison-ceramic-vs-ao-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/cost-per-job-comparison-ceramic-vs-ao-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/11/cost-per-job-comparison-ceramic-vs-ao-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/cost-per-job-comparison-ceramic-vs-ao-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/11/cost-per-job-comparison-ceramic-vs-ao-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/cost-per-job-comparison-ceramic-vs-ao-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/11/cost-per-job-comparison-ceramic-vs-ao-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/cost-per-job-comparison-ceramic-vs-ao-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/11/cost-per-job-comparison-ceramic-vs-ao-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/cost-per-job-comparison-ceramic-vs-ao-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Switch Pads When Moving Up In Grit</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/09/switch-pads-when-moving-up-in-grit-sander-interface-pad/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/09/switch-pads-when-moving-up-in-grit-sander-interface-pad/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 17:21:43 +0000</pubDate><category>Interface Pads &amp; Backing Pads</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>Engineer-tested guide to switching pads as you move up grits.

&lt;p&gt;The radio’s low murmur blends with the scratch-scratch cadence of your sander as you chase a perfect satin surface on a maple tabletop. You can smell resin warming, see dust spiraling in the shaft of afternoon light, feel the sander skate just a bit too eagerly on the flat. The corners are a different story—sharp yesterday, now slightly softened—while the field shows faint halos that only appear when you tilt your head and squint. You pause, run a hand across the grain, and decide to climb from P120 to P180. Instinct says just swap discs and keep going. Experience says this is where surfaces are made or marred. The missing decision? Which pad to put between your machine and the abrasive—specifically, whether to add a sander interface pad, and how to change pad stiffness as you move up in grit.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/05.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/09/switch-pads-when-moving-up-in-grit-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/switch-pads-when-moving-up-in-grit-sander-interface-pad.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/09/switch-pads-when-moving-up-in-grit-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/switch-pads-when-moving-up-in-grit-sander-interface-pad.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/09/switch-pads-when-moving-up-in-grit-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/switch-pads-when-moving-up-in-grit-sander-interface-pad.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/09/switch-pads-when-moving-up-in-grit-sander-interface-pad/cards/instagram/switch-pads-when-moving-up-in-grit-sander-interface-pad.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/09/switch-pads-when-moving-up-in-grit-sander-interface-pad/cards/instagram/switch-pads-when-moving-up-in-grit-sander-interface-pad.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/09/switch-pads-when-moving-up-in-grit-sander-interface-pad/cards/instagram/switch-pads-when-moving-up-in-grit-sander-interface-pad.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/09/switch-pads-when-moving-up-in-grit-sander-interface-pad/cards/pinterest/switch-pads-when-moving-up-in-grit-sander-interface-pad.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/09/switch-pads-when-moving-up-in-grit-sander-interface-pad/cards/pinterest/switch-pads-when-moving-up-in-grit-sander-interface-pad.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/09/switch-pads-when-moving-up-in-grit-sander-interface-pad/cards/pinterest/switch-pads-when-moving-up-in-grit-sander-interface-pad.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/09/switch-pads-when-moving-up-in-grit-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/switch-pads-when-moving-up-in-grit-sander-interface-pad.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/09/switch-pads-when-moving-up-in-grit-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/switch-pads-when-moving-up-in-grit-sander-interface-pad.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/09/switch-pads-when-moving-up-in-grit-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/switch-pads-when-moving-up-in-grit-sander-interface-pad.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Align Belt Joints And Maintain Flatness</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/08/align-belt-joints-and-maintain-flatness-sanding-belts/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/08/align-belt-joints-and-maintain-flatness-sanding-belts/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 08 Feb 2026 15:31:23 +0000</pubDate><category>Sanding Belts &amp; Machines</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-240</category><description>Align belt joints and keep surfaces truly flat with sanding belts—setup, techniques, and troubleshooting from a pro who sands for a living.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="sanding-belts-for-aligned-joints-and-flat-results"&gt;Sanding Belts for Aligned Joints and Flat Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a certain silence that rolls in after you switch off the dust collector—just the soft ping of cooling metal and the faint smell of oak or steel. I love that moment, because it tells me the surface is either ready for finish… or it’s not. Years ago, I flattened a walnut tabletop after dinner, convinced I’d nailed it. Under bright morning light, I saw it: a slight washboard pattern running across the grain, a rhythm I could feel with my palm and see in raking light. The culprit wasn’t my hands; it was the belt seam—barely proud, slightly misaligned—telegraphing with every pass. That was the day I got serious about how sanding belts, joints, and machine setup dictate flatness just as much as technique.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/28.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/08/align-belt-joints-and-maintain-flatness-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/align-belt-joints-and-maintain-flatness-sanding-belts.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/08/align-belt-joints-and-maintain-flatness-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/align-belt-joints-and-maintain-flatness-sanding-belts.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/08/align-belt-joints-and-maintain-flatness-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/align-belt-joints-and-maintain-flatness-sanding-belts.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/08/align-belt-joints-and-maintain-flatness-sanding-belts/cards/instagram/align-belt-joints-and-maintain-flatness-sanding-belts.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/08/align-belt-joints-and-maintain-flatness-sanding-belts/cards/instagram/align-belt-joints-and-maintain-flatness-sanding-belts.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/08/align-belt-joints-and-maintain-flatness-sanding-belts/cards/instagram/align-belt-joints-and-maintain-flatness-sanding-belts.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/08/align-belt-joints-and-maintain-flatness-sanding-belts/cards/pinterest/align-belt-joints-and-maintain-flatness-sanding-belts.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/08/align-belt-joints-and-maintain-flatness-sanding-belts/cards/pinterest/align-belt-joints-and-maintain-flatness-sanding-belts.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/08/align-belt-joints-and-maintain-flatness-sanding-belts/cards/pinterest/align-belt-joints-and-maintain-flatness-sanding-belts.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/08/align-belt-joints-and-maintain-flatness-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/align-belt-joints-and-maintain-flatness-sanding-belts.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/08/align-belt-joints-and-maintain-flatness-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/align-belt-joints-and-maintain-flatness-sanding-belts.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/08/align-belt-joints-and-maintain-flatness-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/align-belt-joints-and-maintain-flatness-sanding-belts.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>13</readingTime></item><item><title>Remove Elastomeric Coatings Using Scrape And Sand Workflow</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/05/remove-elastomeric-coatings-using-scrape-and-sand-workflow-coating-removal/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/05/remove-elastomeric-coatings-using-scrape-and-sand-workflow-coating-removal/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 15:01:19 +0000</pubDate><category>Paint Removal &amp; Surface Prep</category><category>paint prep</category><category>rust removal</category><category>primer coat</category><category>sanding block</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-220</category><category>dust control</category><description>Learn a precise scrape-and-sand workflow for elastomeric coating removal, with tools, techniques, safety, and prep tips for clean, recoat-ready surfaces.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="scrape-and-sand-coating-removal-for-elastomerics"&gt;Scrape-and-Sand Coating Removal for Elastomerics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first time you run a fingertip across a wall coated in elastomeric, it feels like certainty—thick, continuous, weather-tight. It’s the finish someone chose to stop hairline cracks from telegraphing through stucco, to keep a seaside breeze from pushing salt into masonry, or to stretch with a sunbaked metal panel. But years later, a new leak or peeling seam tells a different story: what once protected now needs to come off. If you’ve ever started a coating removal project and realized the job would fight you at every inch, you already know how elastic, stubborn films can turn a simple refresh into a craft exercise.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/14.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/05/remove-elastomeric-coatings-using-scrape-and-sand-workflow-coating-removal/cards/facebook/remove-elastomeric-coatings-using-scrape-and-sand-workflow-coating-removal.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/05/remove-elastomeric-coatings-using-scrape-and-sand-workflow-coating-removal/cards/facebook/remove-elastomeric-coatings-using-scrape-and-sand-workflow-coating-removal.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/05/remove-elastomeric-coatings-using-scrape-and-sand-workflow-coating-removal/cards/facebook/remove-elastomeric-coatings-using-scrape-and-sand-workflow-coating-removal.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/05/remove-elastomeric-coatings-using-scrape-and-sand-workflow-coating-removal/cards/instagram/remove-elastomeric-coatings-using-scrape-and-sand-workflow-coating-removal.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/05/remove-elastomeric-coatings-using-scrape-and-sand-workflow-coating-removal/cards/instagram/remove-elastomeric-coatings-using-scrape-and-sand-workflow-coating-removal.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/05/remove-elastomeric-coatings-using-scrape-and-sand-workflow-coating-removal/cards/instagram/remove-elastomeric-coatings-using-scrape-and-sand-workflow-coating-removal.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/05/remove-elastomeric-coatings-using-scrape-and-sand-workflow-coating-removal/cards/pinterest/remove-elastomeric-coatings-using-scrape-and-sand-workflow-coating-removal.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/05/remove-elastomeric-coatings-using-scrape-and-sand-workflow-coating-removal/cards/pinterest/remove-elastomeric-coatings-using-scrape-and-sand-workflow-coating-removal.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/05/remove-elastomeric-coatings-using-scrape-and-sand-workflow-coating-removal/cards/pinterest/remove-elastomeric-coatings-using-scrape-and-sand-workflow-coating-removal.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/05/remove-elastomeric-coatings-using-scrape-and-sand-workflow-coating-removal/cards/facebook/remove-elastomeric-coatings-using-scrape-and-sand-workflow-coating-removal.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/05/remove-elastomeric-coatings-using-scrape-and-sand-workflow-coating-removal/cards/facebook/remove-elastomeric-coatings-using-scrape-and-sand-workflow-coating-removal.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/05/remove-elastomeric-coatings-using-scrape-and-sand-workflow-coating-removal/cards/facebook/remove-elastomeric-coatings-using-scrape-and-sand-workflow-coating-removal.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>When To Cut And Weld Versus Treat With Converter</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/05/when-to-cut-and-weld-versus-treat-with-converter-rust-repair/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/05/when-to-cut-and-weld-versus-treat-with-converter-rust-repair/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 14:08:46 +0000</pubDate><category>Metal Polishing &amp; Rust Repair</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-800</category><category>rust removal</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Learn when to cut and weld versus treat with converter.

&lt;p&gt;The first cool Saturday of fall, you pop the garage door and that familiar smell hits—old steel, stale undercoating, coffee. You slide on a headlamp, run a hand along the rocker of the wagon you’ve promised yourself you’ll save, and the flashlight beam catches it: a chalky orange bloom creeping along a seam. Rust. It always starts innocent. You grab a pick and it whispers through a scabbed blister like a cracker—underneath, the panel is darker, softer, shocked with pits. That’s the moment that tests your resolve. Is this a quick grind and treat? Or am I cutting and welding today? This is where rust repair moves from theory to reality, and the difference between a weekend win and a year-long project is the decision you make next.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/12.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/05/when-to-cut-and-weld-versus-treat-with-converter-rust-repair/cards/facebook/when-to-cut-and-weld-versus-treat-with-converter-rust-repair.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/05/when-to-cut-and-weld-versus-treat-with-converter-rust-repair/cards/facebook/when-to-cut-and-weld-versus-treat-with-converter-rust-repair.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/05/when-to-cut-and-weld-versus-treat-with-converter-rust-repair/cards/facebook/when-to-cut-and-weld-versus-treat-with-converter-rust-repair.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/05/when-to-cut-and-weld-versus-treat-with-converter-rust-repair/cards/instagram/when-to-cut-and-weld-versus-treat-with-converter-rust-repair.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/05/when-to-cut-and-weld-versus-treat-with-converter-rust-repair/cards/instagram/when-to-cut-and-weld-versus-treat-with-converter-rust-repair.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/05/when-to-cut-and-weld-versus-treat-with-converter-rust-repair/cards/instagram/when-to-cut-and-weld-versus-treat-with-converter-rust-repair.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/05/when-to-cut-and-weld-versus-treat-with-converter-rust-repair/cards/pinterest/when-to-cut-and-weld-versus-treat-with-converter-rust-repair.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/05/when-to-cut-and-weld-versus-treat-with-converter-rust-repair/cards/pinterest/when-to-cut-and-weld-versus-treat-with-converter-rust-repair.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/05/when-to-cut-and-weld-versus-treat-with-converter-rust-repair/cards/pinterest/when-to-cut-and-weld-versus-treat-with-converter-rust-repair.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/05/when-to-cut-and-weld-versus-treat-with-converter-rust-repair/cards/facebook/when-to-cut-and-weld-versus-treat-with-converter-rust-repair.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/05/when-to-cut-and-weld-versus-treat-with-converter-rust-repair/cards/facebook/when-to-cut-and-weld-versus-treat-with-converter-rust-repair.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/05/when-to-cut-and-weld-versus-treat-with-converter-rust-repair/cards/facebook/when-to-cut-and-weld-versus-treat-with-converter-rust-repair.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Remove Silicone And Fisheye Contaminants From Panels</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/04/remove-silicone-and-fisheye-contaminants-from-panels-car-surface-prep/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/04/remove-silicone-and-fisheye-contaminants-from-panels-car-surface-prep/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 14:07:29 +0000</pubDate><category>Auto Body Sanding</category><category>grit-80</category><category>paint prep</category><description>Learn how to remove silicone and prevent fisheyes with precise car surface prep, from decontamination to sealing and test-spraying for flawless finishes.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="car-surface-prep-to-beat-silicone-and-fisheyes"&gt;Car surface prep to beat silicone and fisheyes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday mornings have a way of making even a dusty garage feel like possibility. You pull the cover off your project car, roll open the door, and let the light fall across a fender you’ve sanded smooth. The compressor coughs to life. Mixing stick in one hand, tack cloth in the other, you breathe a little slower, ready to spray. And then it happens: the color flashes wet and glossy—except for a handful of tiny craters where the paint pulls away from the surface. Fisheyes. That sinking mix of frustration and disbelief is familiar to anyone who skipped a step, trusted a “clean” rag, or underestimated how unforgiving contamination can be. The fix doesn’t start with the spray gun; it starts with disciplined car surface prep—understanding what ruins adhesion and how to remove it before it ruins your finish.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/06.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/04/remove-silicone-and-fisheye-contaminants-from-panels-car-surface-prep/cards/facebook/remove-silicone-and-fisheye-contaminants-from-panels-car-surface-prep.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/04/remove-silicone-and-fisheye-contaminants-from-panels-car-surface-prep/cards/facebook/remove-silicone-and-fisheye-contaminants-from-panels-car-surface-prep.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/04/remove-silicone-and-fisheye-contaminants-from-panels-car-surface-prep/cards/facebook/remove-silicone-and-fisheye-contaminants-from-panels-car-surface-prep.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/04/remove-silicone-and-fisheye-contaminants-from-panels-car-surface-prep/cards/instagram/remove-silicone-and-fisheye-contaminants-from-panels-car-surface-prep.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/04/remove-silicone-and-fisheye-contaminants-from-panels-car-surface-prep/cards/instagram/remove-silicone-and-fisheye-contaminants-from-panels-car-surface-prep.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/04/remove-silicone-and-fisheye-contaminants-from-panels-car-surface-prep/cards/instagram/remove-silicone-and-fisheye-contaminants-from-panels-car-surface-prep.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/04/remove-silicone-and-fisheye-contaminants-from-panels-car-surface-prep/cards/pinterest/remove-silicone-and-fisheye-contaminants-from-panels-car-surface-prep.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/04/remove-silicone-and-fisheye-contaminants-from-panels-car-surface-prep/cards/pinterest/remove-silicone-and-fisheye-contaminants-from-panels-car-surface-prep.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/04/remove-silicone-and-fisheye-contaminants-from-panels-car-surface-prep/cards/pinterest/remove-silicone-and-fisheye-contaminants-from-panels-car-surface-prep.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/04/remove-silicone-and-fisheye-contaminants-from-panels-car-surface-prep/cards/facebook/remove-silicone-and-fisheye-contaminants-from-panels-car-surface-prep.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/04/remove-silicone-and-fisheye-contaminants-from-panels-car-surface-prep/cards/facebook/remove-silicone-and-fisheye-contaminants-from-panels-car-surface-prep.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/04/remove-silicone-and-fisheye-contaminants-from-panels-car-surface-prep/cards/facebook/remove-silicone-and-fisheye-contaminants-from-panels-car-surface-prep.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Flatten Glued Up Panels With Long Sanding Blocks</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/01/flatten-glued-up-panels-with-long-sanding-blocks-surface-leveling/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/01/flatten-glued-up-panels-with-long-sanding-blocks-surface-leveling/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 01 Feb 2026 15:09:29 +0000</pubDate><category>Wood sanding</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit progression</category><category>clear coat</category><category>sanding block</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>Learn surface leveling with long sanding blocks to flatten glued-up panels cleanly, accurately, and without a planer—pro tips from a workshop specialist.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="surface-leveling-flatten-glued-up-panels-by-hand"&gt;Surface Leveling: Flatten Glued-Up Panels by Hand&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The clamps click loose on a Saturday morning, and the shop exhales. You can smell the faint sweetness of cured glue and yesterday’s coffee. The panel—boards you’ve nursed from rough lumber to edge-jointed strips—comes out of the pipe clamps like a promise. But every promise needs work. There’s a whisper of misalignment at the seams, a few proud edges, maybe a clamp bruise. You don’t own a drum sander, and your benchtop planer isn’t wide enough. Still, the goal doesn’t change: a dead-flat, honest surface that feels like a single piece of wood under your palm.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/25.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/01/flatten-glued-up-panels-with-long-sanding-blocks-surface-leveling/cards/facebook/flatten-glued-up-panels-with-long-sanding-blocks-surface-leveling.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/01/flatten-glued-up-panels-with-long-sanding-blocks-surface-leveling/cards/facebook/flatten-glued-up-panels-with-long-sanding-blocks-surface-leveling.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/01/flatten-glued-up-panels-with-long-sanding-blocks-surface-leveling/cards/facebook/flatten-glued-up-panels-with-long-sanding-blocks-surface-leveling.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/01/flatten-glued-up-panels-with-long-sanding-blocks-surface-leveling/cards/instagram/flatten-glued-up-panels-with-long-sanding-blocks-surface-leveling.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/01/flatten-glued-up-panels-with-long-sanding-blocks-surface-leveling/cards/instagram/flatten-glued-up-panels-with-long-sanding-blocks-surface-leveling.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/01/flatten-glued-up-panels-with-long-sanding-blocks-surface-leveling/cards/instagram/flatten-glued-up-panels-with-long-sanding-blocks-surface-leveling.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/01/flatten-glued-up-panels-with-long-sanding-blocks-surface-leveling/cards/pinterest/flatten-glued-up-panels-with-long-sanding-blocks-surface-leveling.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/01/flatten-glued-up-panels-with-long-sanding-blocks-surface-leveling/cards/pinterest/flatten-glued-up-panels-with-long-sanding-blocks-surface-leveling.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/01/flatten-glued-up-panels-with-long-sanding-blocks-surface-leveling/cards/pinterest/flatten-glued-up-panels-with-long-sanding-blocks-surface-leveling.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/01/flatten-glued-up-panels-with-long-sanding-blocks-surface-leveling/cards/facebook/flatten-glued-up-panels-with-long-sanding-blocks-surface-leveling.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/01/flatten-glued-up-panels-with-long-sanding-blocks-surface-leveling/cards/facebook/flatten-glued-up-panels-with-long-sanding-blocks-surface-leveling.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/01/flatten-glued-up-panels-with-long-sanding-blocks-surface-leveling/cards/facebook/flatten-glued-up-panels-with-long-sanding-blocks-surface-leveling.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Use Pencil Guide Marks To Track Sanding Progress</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/31/use-pencil-guide-marks-to-track-sanding-progress-hand-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/31/use-pencil-guide-marks-to-track-sanding-progress-hand-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 14:53:05 +0000</pubDate><category>Hand Sanding Techniques</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit progression</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>with precision.

&lt;p&gt;The garage is quiet except for the soft rasp of paper over wood. It’s early, the kind of morning when you can see your breath just a little, and the coffee hasn’t cooled yet. There’s a maple tabletop on the horses, and your first instinct is to reach for a random orbital and a handful of discs. But you pause. Today is about control, about reading the surface rather than forcing it. You sharpen a pencil and trace quick, looping witness marks across the panel, a light lattice that looks almost careless—until you start hand sanding. Stroke after deliberate stroke, the graphite becomes a progress meter, revealing the high spots that clear first and the stubborn low areas that hold onto their gray shadows. You’re not just smoothing wood; you’re mapping it in real time.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/21.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/31/use-pencil-guide-marks-to-track-sanding-progress-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/use-pencil-guide-marks-to-track-sanding-progress-hand-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/31/use-pencil-guide-marks-to-track-sanding-progress-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/use-pencil-guide-marks-to-track-sanding-progress-hand-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/31/use-pencil-guide-marks-to-track-sanding-progress-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/use-pencil-guide-marks-to-track-sanding-progress-hand-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/31/use-pencil-guide-marks-to-track-sanding-progress-hand-sanding/cards/instagram/use-pencil-guide-marks-to-track-sanding-progress-hand-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/31/use-pencil-guide-marks-to-track-sanding-progress-hand-sanding/cards/instagram/use-pencil-guide-marks-to-track-sanding-progress-hand-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/31/use-pencil-guide-marks-to-track-sanding-progress-hand-sanding/cards/instagram/use-pencil-guide-marks-to-track-sanding-progress-hand-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/31/use-pencil-guide-marks-to-track-sanding-progress-hand-sanding/cards/pinterest/use-pencil-guide-marks-to-track-sanding-progress-hand-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/31/use-pencil-guide-marks-to-track-sanding-progress-hand-sanding/cards/pinterest/use-pencil-guide-marks-to-track-sanding-progress-hand-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/31/use-pencil-guide-marks-to-track-sanding-progress-hand-sanding/cards/pinterest/use-pencil-guide-marks-to-track-sanding-progress-hand-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/31/use-pencil-guide-marks-to-track-sanding-progress-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/use-pencil-guide-marks-to-track-sanding-progress-hand-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/31/use-pencil-guide-marks-to-track-sanding-progress-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/use-pencil-guide-marks-to-track-sanding-progress-hand-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/31/use-pencil-guide-marks-to-track-sanding-progress-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/use-pencil-guide-marks-to-track-sanding-progress-hand-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Support And Availability Of Grits</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/30/support-and-availability-of-grits-best-sandpaper-brand/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/30/support-and-availability-of-grits-best-sandpaper-brand/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 14:01:33 +0000</pubDate><category>Brand &amp; Quality Comparison</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-280</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><description>A workshop guide to picking the best sandpaper brand with the right grit range, formats, and support—plus real sanding sequences and pro tips.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="choosing-the-best-sandpaper-brand-for-every-grit"&gt;Choosing the Best Sandpaper Brand for Every Grit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Late Sunday, the shop is warm and a little loud—random orbitals humming, shop vac pulling a steady whirr, and a maple tabletop glowing under fresh shellac. You’re feeling that flow where the dust hangs like a halo and every pass lines up with the grain just right. Then it happens: you reach for P320 to close the gap between P240 and P400… and the drawer is empty. You try P280 from another pack but it’s a different brand; the cut is jumpier, the stearate loads different, and the paper tears at the clip. Now you’ve got swirl marks, a 30-minute detour to the store, and a finish window slipping away. That’s the moment you learn that the best sandpaper brand isn’t just about how sharp the grit is or how long it lasts—it’s about support, continuity, and having the right grits in the formats you use, when you need them.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/17.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/30/support-and-availability-of-grits-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/facebook/support-and-availability-of-grits-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/30/support-and-availability-of-grits-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/facebook/support-and-availability-of-grits-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/30/support-and-availability-of-grits-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/facebook/support-and-availability-of-grits-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/30/support-and-availability-of-grits-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/instagram/support-and-availability-of-grits-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/30/support-and-availability-of-grits-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/instagram/support-and-availability-of-grits-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/30/support-and-availability-of-grits-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/instagram/support-and-availability-of-grits-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/30/support-and-availability-of-grits-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/pinterest/support-and-availability-of-grits-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/30/support-and-availability-of-grits-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/pinterest/support-and-availability-of-grits-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/30/support-and-availability-of-grits-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/pinterest/support-and-availability-of-grits-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/30/support-and-availability-of-grits-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/facebook/support-and-availability-of-grits-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/30/support-and-availability-of-grits-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/facebook/support-and-availability-of-grits-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/30/support-and-availability-of-grits-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/facebook/support-and-availability-of-grits-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>13</readingTime></item><item><title>Belts Discs And Sheets Grit Mapping</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/24/belts-discs-and-sheets-grit-mapping-sandpaper-grit-chart/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/24/belts-discs-and-sheets-grit-mapping-sandpaper-grit-chart/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 13:36:19 +0000</pubDate><category>Grit Guide &amp; Education</category><category>grit chart</category><category>abrasive standards</category><category>grit progression</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><description>A practical sandpaper grit chart guide for mapping belts, discs, and sheets, with real workshop tips to pick the right grit and finish faster.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="sandpaper-grit-chart-belts-discs-and-sheets-mapping"&gt;Sandpaper Grit Chart: Belts, Discs, and Sheets Mapping&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It always starts with a surface and a feeling. Maybe it’s the kitchen table that’s seen holiday spills, or the fender you’ve been meaning to fix, or a maple cutting board you want to make heirloom-smooth. You run your hand across it and feel the story: dents here, scratches there, a patch of stubborn paint that won’t let go. That’s the moment I reach for a notepad, not the sander. Why? Because every great finish begins on paper—specifically, with a sandpaper grit chart. If you’ve ever jumped into sanding and ended with swirl marks, burn-through, or “Why does this still look cloudy?”, the solution wasn’t more pressure or more time. It was a better map.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/22.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/24/belts-discs-and-sheets-grit-mapping-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/belts-discs-and-sheets-grit-mapping-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/24/belts-discs-and-sheets-grit-mapping-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/belts-discs-and-sheets-grit-mapping-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/24/belts-discs-and-sheets-grit-mapping-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/belts-discs-and-sheets-grit-mapping-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/24/belts-discs-and-sheets-grit-mapping-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/instagram/belts-discs-and-sheets-grit-mapping-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/24/belts-discs-and-sheets-grit-mapping-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/instagram/belts-discs-and-sheets-grit-mapping-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/24/belts-discs-and-sheets-grit-mapping-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/instagram/belts-discs-and-sheets-grit-mapping-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/24/belts-discs-and-sheets-grit-mapping-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/pinterest/belts-discs-and-sheets-grit-mapping-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/24/belts-discs-and-sheets-grit-mapping-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/pinterest/belts-discs-and-sheets-grit-mapping-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/24/belts-discs-and-sheets-grit-mapping-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/pinterest/belts-discs-and-sheets-grit-mapping-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/24/belts-discs-and-sheets-grit-mapping-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/belts-discs-and-sheets-grit-mapping-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/24/belts-discs-and-sheets-grit-mapping-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/belts-discs-and-sheets-grit-mapping-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/24/belts-discs-and-sheets-grit-mapping-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/belts-discs-and-sheets-grit-mapping-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Prevent Clogging On Resinous Woods</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/21/prevent-clogging-on-resinous-woods-sanding-belts/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/21/prevent-clogging-on-resinous-woods-sanding-belts/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 13:53:23 +0000</pubDate><category>Sanding Belts &amp; Machines</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-360</category><description>Engineer-tested ways to prevent sanding belt loading on pine and fir.

&lt;p&gt;The first time I tried to tame a stack of knotty Southern yellow pine, I thought new sanding belts would be my shortcut to a glassy finish. The shop smelled like turpentine and warm sugar—pitch warming in the fibers—and the belt sander sounded confident until the tone changed. Within minutes, cut rate fell off a cliff. The abrasive looked frosted in amber: a mosaic of resin streaks and smeared dust welded into the grit. I slowed my feed, pressed harder, and just made more heat. The belt polished rather than cut; the workpiece glazed. I swapped belts, only to watch the next one load just as fast.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/12.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/21/prevent-clogging-on-resinous-woods-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/prevent-clogging-on-resinous-woods-sanding-belts.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/21/prevent-clogging-on-resinous-woods-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/prevent-clogging-on-resinous-woods-sanding-belts.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/21/prevent-clogging-on-resinous-woods-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/prevent-clogging-on-resinous-woods-sanding-belts.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/21/prevent-clogging-on-resinous-woods-sanding-belts/cards/instagram/prevent-clogging-on-resinous-woods-sanding-belts.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/21/prevent-clogging-on-resinous-woods-sanding-belts/cards/instagram/prevent-clogging-on-resinous-woods-sanding-belts.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/21/prevent-clogging-on-resinous-woods-sanding-belts/cards/instagram/prevent-clogging-on-resinous-woods-sanding-belts.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/21/prevent-clogging-on-resinous-woods-sanding-belts/cards/pinterest/prevent-clogging-on-resinous-woods-sanding-belts.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/21/prevent-clogging-on-resinous-woods-sanding-belts/cards/pinterest/prevent-clogging-on-resinous-woods-sanding-belts.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/21/prevent-clogging-on-resinous-woods-sanding-belts/cards/pinterest/prevent-clogging-on-resinous-woods-sanding-belts.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/21/prevent-clogging-on-resinous-woods-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/prevent-clogging-on-resinous-woods-sanding-belts.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/21/prevent-clogging-on-resinous-woods-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/prevent-clogging-on-resinous-woods-sanding-belts.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/21/prevent-clogging-on-resinous-woods-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/prevent-clogging-on-resinous-woods-sanding-belts.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>13</readingTime></item><item><title>Blend Primer Edges Using A Sponge</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/20/blend-primer-edges-using-a-sponge-sanding-sponge/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/20/blend-primer-edges-using-a-sponge-sanding-sponge/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 13:53:37 +0000</pubDate><category>Sanding Sponges</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-280</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit progression</category><category>joint compound</category><category>dust control</category><description>Learn how to feather primer edges with a sanding sponge for invisible transitions.

&lt;p&gt;It’s early, the light is low, and an uneven patch on your wall catches a grazing beam of sun. You prepped the area last night—filled a hairline crack, primed the spot, and stepped away feeling done. But this morning, the primer edge telegraphs a hard line no topcoat could hide. If you’ve been here before, you know the difference between a near miss and a seamless finish comes down to one modest tool: a sanding sponge. Not just any abrasive will do. Foam-backed abrasives deliver conformal contact, edge control, and repeatable scratch patterns you can trust. They turn an obvious patch into a clean gradient that vanishes under paint.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/10.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/20/blend-primer-edges-using-a-sponge-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/blend-primer-edges-using-a-sponge-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/20/blend-primer-edges-using-a-sponge-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/blend-primer-edges-using-a-sponge-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/20/blend-primer-edges-using-a-sponge-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/blend-primer-edges-using-a-sponge-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/20/blend-primer-edges-using-a-sponge-sanding-sponge/cards/instagram/blend-primer-edges-using-a-sponge-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/20/blend-primer-edges-using-a-sponge-sanding-sponge/cards/instagram/blend-primer-edges-using-a-sponge-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/20/blend-primer-edges-using-a-sponge-sanding-sponge/cards/instagram/blend-primer-edges-using-a-sponge-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/20/blend-primer-edges-using-a-sponge-sanding-sponge/cards/pinterest/blend-primer-edges-using-a-sponge-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/20/blend-primer-edges-using-a-sponge-sanding-sponge/cards/pinterest/blend-primer-edges-using-a-sponge-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/20/blend-primer-edges-using-a-sponge-sanding-sponge/cards/pinterest/blend-primer-edges-using-a-sponge-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/20/blend-primer-edges-using-a-sponge-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/blend-primer-edges-using-a-sponge-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/20/blend-primer-edges-using-a-sponge-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/blend-primer-edges-using-a-sponge-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/20/blend-primer-edges-using-a-sponge-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/blend-primer-edges-using-a-sponge-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Block Sanding Tips For Woodworking</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/19/block-sanding-tips-for-woodworking-sanding-block/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/19/block-sanding-tips-for-woodworking-sanding-block/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 14:49:53 +0000</pubDate><category>Sanding Blocks</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-220</category><category>sanding block</category><category>dust control</category><category>grit progression</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>Master block sanding with the right sanding block, grit, and technique.

&lt;p&gt;Saturday sunlight cuts through the garage dust as you run a hand along the tabletop you’ve been building for weeks. It’s close—close enough that friends would call it done—but your fingertips still catch where the light catches: faint ripples, a couple of low spots, swirl ghosts you can’t quite ignore. You try another pass with a random-orbit sander and the same thing happens—some areas look better, others worse. It feels like a conversation where you keep talking past the point, never quite saying what you mean. Then you reach for a simple tool that promises a steadier answer: a sanding block.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/08.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/19/block-sanding-tips-for-woodworking-sanding-block/cards/facebook/block-sanding-tips-for-woodworking-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/19/block-sanding-tips-for-woodworking-sanding-block/cards/facebook/block-sanding-tips-for-woodworking-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/19/block-sanding-tips-for-woodworking-sanding-block/cards/facebook/block-sanding-tips-for-woodworking-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/19/block-sanding-tips-for-woodworking-sanding-block/cards/instagram/block-sanding-tips-for-woodworking-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/19/block-sanding-tips-for-woodworking-sanding-block/cards/instagram/block-sanding-tips-for-woodworking-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/19/block-sanding-tips-for-woodworking-sanding-block/cards/instagram/block-sanding-tips-for-woodworking-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/19/block-sanding-tips-for-woodworking-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/block-sanding-tips-for-woodworking-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/19/block-sanding-tips-for-woodworking-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/block-sanding-tips-for-woodworking-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/19/block-sanding-tips-for-woodworking-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/block-sanding-tips-for-woodworking-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/19/block-sanding-tips-for-woodworking-sanding-block/cards/facebook/block-sanding-tips-for-woodworking-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/19/block-sanding-tips-for-woodworking-sanding-block/cards/facebook/block-sanding-tips-for-woodworking-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/19/block-sanding-tips-for-woodworking-sanding-block/cards/facebook/block-sanding-tips-for-woodworking-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Crosshatch Passes For Flat Panel Sanding</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/18/crosshatch-passes-for-flat-panel-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/18/crosshatch-passes-for-flat-panel-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 14:18:18 +0000</pubDate><category>Random Orbital Sanding</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-1000</category><description>Engineer-tested crosshatch passes for flat panel sanding with random orbital sanding.

&lt;p&gt;The first time I truly trusted a surface was under shop lights late on a Sunday, not at noon when everything looks perfect. I had a maple tabletop on trestles, pencil grid scribbled across the face, edges taped to protect the bevel. The shop was quiet except for the steady hum of the sander—a 5-inch random orbital—drawing dust through a tidy hose looped overhead. In that light, imperfections don’t yell; they whisper. High spots break the graphite lines first. Low spots hold onto them stubbornly. I moved the machine in a measured, crosshatch pattern, alternating angles like a metronome, and watched the pencil disappear in a uniform fade rather than blotches.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/04.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/18/crosshatch-passes-for-flat-panel-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/crosshatch-passes-for-flat-panel-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/18/crosshatch-passes-for-flat-panel-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/crosshatch-passes-for-flat-panel-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/18/crosshatch-passes-for-flat-panel-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/crosshatch-passes-for-flat-panel-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/18/crosshatch-passes-for-flat-panel-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/instagram/crosshatch-passes-for-flat-panel-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/18/crosshatch-passes-for-flat-panel-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/instagram/crosshatch-passes-for-flat-panel-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/18/crosshatch-passes-for-flat-panel-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/instagram/crosshatch-passes-for-flat-panel-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/18/crosshatch-passes-for-flat-panel-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/pinterest/crosshatch-passes-for-flat-panel-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/18/crosshatch-passes-for-flat-panel-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/pinterest/crosshatch-passes-for-flat-panel-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/18/crosshatch-passes-for-flat-panel-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/pinterest/crosshatch-passes-for-flat-panel-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/18/crosshatch-passes-for-flat-panel-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/crosshatch-passes-for-flat-panel-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/18/crosshatch-passes-for-flat-panel-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/crosshatch-passes-for-flat-panel-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/18/crosshatch-passes-for-flat-panel-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/crosshatch-passes-for-flat-panel-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Flatten Texture Without Exposing Basecoat On High Spots</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/15/flatten-texture-without-exposing-basecoat-on-high-spots-clear-coat-leveling/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/15/flatten-texture-without-exposing-basecoat-on-high-spots-clear-coat-leveling/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 15:40:14 +0000</pubDate><category>Wet Sanding Clear Coat</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>clear coat</category><category>mirror finish</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>Learn how to flatten clear coat texture without burning through the base.

&lt;p&gt;You know the moment: the car looks incredible under garage lights, glossy and deep. But then you pull into bright midday sun and see the texture—orange peel, a few dust nibs, maybe a mild wave on a hood that deserves to be glass-smooth. Your stomach drops. You want that mirror finish, yet the fear of sanding through the high spots into basecoat is real. It’s not just about shine; it’s about preserving the integrity (and value) of the paint system. That’s where clear coat leveling comes in—methodical, careful, and entirely achievable with the right approach.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/21.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/15/flatten-texture-without-exposing-basecoat-on-high-spots-clear-coat-leveling/cards/facebook/flatten-texture-without-exposing-basecoat-on-high-spots-clear-coat-leveling.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/15/flatten-texture-without-exposing-basecoat-on-high-spots-clear-coat-leveling/cards/facebook/flatten-texture-without-exposing-basecoat-on-high-spots-clear-coat-leveling.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/15/flatten-texture-without-exposing-basecoat-on-high-spots-clear-coat-leveling/cards/facebook/flatten-texture-without-exposing-basecoat-on-high-spots-clear-coat-leveling.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/15/flatten-texture-without-exposing-basecoat-on-high-spots-clear-coat-leveling/cards/instagram/flatten-texture-without-exposing-basecoat-on-high-spots-clear-coat-leveling.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/15/flatten-texture-without-exposing-basecoat-on-high-spots-clear-coat-leveling/cards/instagram/flatten-texture-without-exposing-basecoat-on-high-spots-clear-coat-leveling.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/15/flatten-texture-without-exposing-basecoat-on-high-spots-clear-coat-leveling/cards/instagram/flatten-texture-without-exposing-basecoat-on-high-spots-clear-coat-leveling.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/15/flatten-texture-without-exposing-basecoat-on-high-spots-clear-coat-leveling/cards/pinterest/flatten-texture-without-exposing-basecoat-on-high-spots-clear-coat-leveling.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/15/flatten-texture-without-exposing-basecoat-on-high-spots-clear-coat-leveling/cards/pinterest/flatten-texture-without-exposing-basecoat-on-high-spots-clear-coat-leveling.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/15/flatten-texture-without-exposing-basecoat-on-high-spots-clear-coat-leveling/cards/pinterest/flatten-texture-without-exposing-basecoat-on-high-spots-clear-coat-leveling.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/15/flatten-texture-without-exposing-basecoat-on-high-spots-clear-coat-leveling/cards/facebook/flatten-texture-without-exposing-basecoat-on-high-spots-clear-coat-leveling.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/15/flatten-texture-without-exposing-basecoat-on-high-spots-clear-coat-leveling/cards/facebook/flatten-texture-without-exposing-basecoat-on-high-spots-clear-coat-leveling.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/15/flatten-texture-without-exposing-basecoat-on-high-spots-clear-coat-leveling/cards/facebook/flatten-texture-without-exposing-basecoat-on-high-spots-clear-coat-leveling.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>How To Feather Edge Old Paint Without Visible Steps</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/15/how-to-feather-edge-old-paint-without-visible-steps-auto-body-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/15/how-to-feather-edge-old-paint-without-visible-steps-auto-body-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 13:46:07 +0000</pubDate><category>Auto Body Sanding</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit progression</category><category>sanding block</category><category>dust control</category><description>Learn feather edging without steps.

&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning, the garage is cool and quiet except for the soft hiss of the compressor winding down and the rattle of a block sander in my hand. The old pickup in front of me has stories baked into every panel—sun-faded lacquer, a few driveway dings, and a repair line from years ago that catches the light like a ridge on a map. If you’ve ever repainted a panel only to see a ghost ring around your repair, you know the sting. You steal a glance sideways under the shop light and there it is—the “step.” That’s the moment when real craftsmanship starts. The difference between an amateur patch and a pro-level finish often comes down to feather edging: the controlled, patient art of tapering layers of old paint so the transition becomes invisible. This is the heart of auto body sanding—hands, eyes, and feel coming together—where you earn that invisible blend long before the spray gun ever leaves the rack.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/19.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/15/how-to-feather-edge-old-paint-without-visible-steps-auto-body-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-feather-edge-old-paint-without-visible-steps-auto-body-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/15/how-to-feather-edge-old-paint-without-visible-steps-auto-body-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-feather-edge-old-paint-without-visible-steps-auto-body-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/15/how-to-feather-edge-old-paint-without-visible-steps-auto-body-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-feather-edge-old-paint-without-visible-steps-auto-body-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/15/how-to-feather-edge-old-paint-without-visible-steps-auto-body-sanding/cards/instagram/how-to-feather-edge-old-paint-without-visible-steps-auto-body-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/15/how-to-feather-edge-old-paint-without-visible-steps-auto-body-sanding/cards/instagram/how-to-feather-edge-old-paint-without-visible-steps-auto-body-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/15/how-to-feather-edge-old-paint-without-visible-steps-auto-body-sanding/cards/instagram/how-to-feather-edge-old-paint-without-visible-steps-auto-body-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/15/how-to-feather-edge-old-paint-without-visible-steps-auto-body-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-to-feather-edge-old-paint-without-visible-steps-auto-body-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/15/how-to-feather-edge-old-paint-without-visible-steps-auto-body-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-to-feather-edge-old-paint-without-visible-steps-auto-body-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/15/how-to-feather-edge-old-paint-without-visible-steps-auto-body-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-to-feather-edge-old-paint-without-visible-steps-auto-body-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/15/how-to-feather-edge-old-paint-without-visible-steps-auto-body-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-feather-edge-old-paint-without-visible-steps-auto-body-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/15/how-to-feather-edge-old-paint-without-visible-steps-auto-body-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-feather-edge-old-paint-without-visible-steps-auto-body-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/15/how-to-feather-edge-old-paint-without-visible-steps-auto-body-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-feather-edge-old-paint-without-visible-steps-auto-body-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Remove Mill Glaze From New Deck Boards By Sanding</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/14/remove-mill-glaze-from-new-deck-boards-by-sanding-deck-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/14/remove-mill-glaze-from-new-deck-boards-by-sanding-deck-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 13:45:47 +0000</pubDate><category>Floor &amp; Deck Sanding</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>deck sanding</category><category>grit progression</category><category>dust control</category><description>Engineer-tested guide to deck sanding for removing mill glaze on new boards.

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve ever watched fresh rain bead up and roll off a brand-new deck, you’ve seen the surface behave like a waxed car. It looks healthy and waterproof, right up to the moment you try to stain it and the finish flashes unevenly, blotches, or peels in sheets. That isn’t a failure of the stain. It’s the result of mill glaze—an artifact from planing at the mill where knives compress fibers, heat softens lignin, and resins are smeared across the surface, creating a semi-burnished shell. The surest fix is precise, methodical deck sanding. Not a token pass, but a controlled removal of that top layer so finish can mechanically anchor and wick into pores as the manufacturer intended.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/17.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/14/remove-mill-glaze-from-new-deck-boards-by-sanding-deck-sanding/cards/facebook/remove-mill-glaze-from-new-deck-boards-by-sanding-deck-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/14/remove-mill-glaze-from-new-deck-boards-by-sanding-deck-sanding/cards/facebook/remove-mill-glaze-from-new-deck-boards-by-sanding-deck-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/14/remove-mill-glaze-from-new-deck-boards-by-sanding-deck-sanding/cards/facebook/remove-mill-glaze-from-new-deck-boards-by-sanding-deck-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/14/remove-mill-glaze-from-new-deck-boards-by-sanding-deck-sanding/cards/instagram/remove-mill-glaze-from-new-deck-boards-by-sanding-deck-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/14/remove-mill-glaze-from-new-deck-boards-by-sanding-deck-sanding/cards/instagram/remove-mill-glaze-from-new-deck-boards-by-sanding-deck-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/14/remove-mill-glaze-from-new-deck-boards-by-sanding-deck-sanding/cards/instagram/remove-mill-glaze-from-new-deck-boards-by-sanding-deck-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/14/remove-mill-glaze-from-new-deck-boards-by-sanding-deck-sanding/cards/pinterest/remove-mill-glaze-from-new-deck-boards-by-sanding-deck-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/14/remove-mill-glaze-from-new-deck-boards-by-sanding-deck-sanding/cards/pinterest/remove-mill-glaze-from-new-deck-boards-by-sanding-deck-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/14/remove-mill-glaze-from-new-deck-boards-by-sanding-deck-sanding/cards/pinterest/remove-mill-glaze-from-new-deck-boards-by-sanding-deck-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/14/remove-mill-glaze-from-new-deck-boards-by-sanding-deck-sanding/cards/facebook/remove-mill-glaze-from-new-deck-boards-by-sanding-deck-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/14/remove-mill-glaze-from-new-deck-boards-by-sanding-deck-sanding/cards/facebook/remove-mill-glaze-from-new-deck-boards-by-sanding-deck-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/14/remove-mill-glaze-from-new-deck-boards-by-sanding-deck-sanding/cards/facebook/remove-mill-glaze-from-new-deck-boards-by-sanding-deck-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>9</readingTime></item><item><title>Identify Grain Direction Before Sanding Surfaces</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/identify-grain-direction-before-sanding-surfaces-grain-preparation/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/identify-grain-direction-before-sanding-surfaces-grain-preparation/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 13:36:01 +0000</pubDate><category>Wood sanding</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>sanding block</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Learn grain preparation: practical tests to read grain direction before sanding, abrasive science that prevents scratches, and steps for flawless finishes.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="grain-preparation-how-to-read-wood-before-sanding"&gt;Grain Preparation: How to Read Wood Before Sanding&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few Saturdays ago, I stood in the morning light with a walnut tabletop that had the right dimensions and the wrong look. Sun traced across the surface at a shallow angle, revealing every swirl left by a rushed sanding job the night before. I’d worked through my grits, vacuumed diligently, and still the surface read like a topographical map of mistakes. What changed the next pass wasn’t a fancier sander or a new finish—it was slowing down to read the wood first. Grain preparation sounds mundane, but it’s the difference between fighting a board and letting it finish itself. When you know which way the fibers lie, where they reverse, and how earlywood and latewood will respond, you save hours and achieve a surface that looks polished even before the first coat.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/09.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/identify-grain-direction-before-sanding-surfaces-grain-preparation/cards/facebook/identify-grain-direction-before-sanding-surfaces-grain-preparation.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/identify-grain-direction-before-sanding-surfaces-grain-preparation/cards/facebook/identify-grain-direction-before-sanding-surfaces-grain-preparation.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/identify-grain-direction-before-sanding-surfaces-grain-preparation/cards/facebook/identify-grain-direction-before-sanding-surfaces-grain-preparation.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/identify-grain-direction-before-sanding-surfaces-grain-preparation/cards/instagram/identify-grain-direction-before-sanding-surfaces-grain-preparation.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/identify-grain-direction-before-sanding-surfaces-grain-preparation/cards/instagram/identify-grain-direction-before-sanding-surfaces-grain-preparation.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/identify-grain-direction-before-sanding-surfaces-grain-preparation/cards/instagram/identify-grain-direction-before-sanding-surfaces-grain-preparation.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/identify-grain-direction-before-sanding-surfaces-grain-preparation/cards/pinterest/identify-grain-direction-before-sanding-surfaces-grain-preparation.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/identify-grain-direction-before-sanding-surfaces-grain-preparation/cards/pinterest/identify-grain-direction-before-sanding-surfaces-grain-preparation.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/identify-grain-direction-before-sanding-surfaces-grain-preparation/cards/pinterest/identify-grain-direction-before-sanding-surfaces-grain-preparation.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/identify-grain-direction-before-sanding-surfaces-grain-preparation/cards/facebook/identify-grain-direction-before-sanding-surfaces-grain-preparation.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/identify-grain-direction-before-sanding-surfaces-grain-preparation/cards/facebook/identify-grain-direction-before-sanding-surfaces-grain-preparation.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/identify-grain-direction-before-sanding-surfaces-grain-preparation/cards/facebook/identify-grain-direction-before-sanding-surfaces-grain-preparation.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>When To Choose Cloth Or Fiber Backings</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/07/when-to-choose-cloth-or-fiber-backings-open-coat-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/07/when-to-choose-cloth-or-fiber-backings-open-coat-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 15:23:39 +0000</pubDate><category>Backing Types &amp; Coatings</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><description>Learn when to choose cloth or fiber abrasive backings and how open coat sandpaper improves cut, reduces loading, and optimizes sanding workflows.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="cloth-vs-fiber-backings-with-open-coat-sandpaper"&gt;Cloth vs Fiber Backings with Open Coat Sandpaper&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It starts on a Saturday morning with a surface that matters. Maybe it’s a maple tabletop you milled last fall, or a set of welded brackets you promised to deliver before lunch. You switch on the dust extractor, index a fresh disc, and take the first pass. Within seconds, you know if the setup is right: the abrasive either cuts cleanly or smears; it either stays cool and sheds swarf or loads, glazing the face and burning the work. This isn’t luck. It’s backing selection, grain geometry, and coating density working together. For a lot of workflows—especially on resinous woods, body filler, aluminum, and painted surfaces—open coat sandpaper keeps the cut alive by leaving voids between abrasive grains that evacuate debris instead of embedding it. But even the right coat pattern underperforms if the backing can’t transmit force, resist heat, or conform to the surface you’re shaping.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/28.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/07/when-to-choose-cloth-or-fiber-backings-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-cloth-or-fiber-backings-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/07/when-to-choose-cloth-or-fiber-backings-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-cloth-or-fiber-backings-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/07/when-to-choose-cloth-or-fiber-backings-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-cloth-or-fiber-backings-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/07/when-to-choose-cloth-or-fiber-backings-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/instagram/when-to-choose-cloth-or-fiber-backings-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/07/when-to-choose-cloth-or-fiber-backings-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/instagram/when-to-choose-cloth-or-fiber-backings-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/07/when-to-choose-cloth-or-fiber-backings-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/instagram/when-to-choose-cloth-or-fiber-backings-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/07/when-to-choose-cloth-or-fiber-backings-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/when-to-choose-cloth-or-fiber-backings-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/07/when-to-choose-cloth-or-fiber-backings-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/when-to-choose-cloth-or-fiber-backings-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/07/when-to-choose-cloth-or-fiber-backings-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/when-to-choose-cloth-or-fiber-backings-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/07/when-to-choose-cloth-or-fiber-backings-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-cloth-or-fiber-backings-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/07/when-to-choose-cloth-or-fiber-backings-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-cloth-or-fiber-backings-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/07/when-to-choose-cloth-or-fiber-backings-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-cloth-or-fiber-backings-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Edge And Profile Grit Selection</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jan 2026 13:34:23 +0000</pubDate><category>Grit Range &amp; Classification</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-101</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-280</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><description>Learn to pick the right sandpaper grit for edges and profiles.

&lt;p&gt;It starts with the first swipe on a sharp, splintery edge—maybe the oak tabletop you rescued, the cabinet door frame you’re painting for a bathroom refresh, or the picture frame for a gift that’s due tonight. In the quiet of the workshop, dust hangs in the light and you feel the edge transform under your fingers. The urge is to “just sand it” and keep going. But edges and profiles aren’t flat panels; they magnify every mistake. Round over too far and the joint line disappears. Skip a grit and scratch ghosts show up in the finish. Choose the wrong sandpaper grit and you’ll waste time or, worse, bruise a delicate profile you spent hours cutting.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/08.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit/cards/instagram/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit/cards/instagram/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit/cards/instagram/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit/cards/pinterest/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit/cards/pinterest/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit/cards/pinterest/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Grit Sequence For Hardwood Versus Softwood</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/02/grit-sequence-for-hardwood-versus-softwood-sandpaper-grit-chart/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/02/grit-sequence-for-hardwood-versus-softwood-sandpaper-grit-chart/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 15:05:34 +0000</pubDate><category>Grit Guide &amp; Education</category><category>grit chart</category><category>abrasive standards</category><category>grit progression</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><description>Engineer-tested grit sequences for hardwood vs softwood, with a clear sandpaper grit chart, material science insights, and pro tips for faster, cleaner</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="sandpaper-grit-chart-hardwood-vs-softwood-guide"&gt;Sandpaper Grit Chart: Hardwood vs Softwood Guide&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a rainy Saturday in my small basement shop, I set a maple board on the bench next to a knotty piece of pine. The goal seemed simple: sand both to a flawless, finish-ready surface without wasting time or rounding edges. But if you’ve ever swapped back and forth between hardwood and softwood, you know the result can be anything but simple—soft pine can gum up a disc in minutes, while dense maple highlights every stray swirl you hoped wouldn’t show through the finish. I pulled out my sanding cart, a set of discs from P80 to P240, and the printed sandpaper grit chart I keep taped to a cabinet door. The right sequence is less about dogma and more about physics: grain hardness, resin content, abrasive mineral, and scratch geometry interacting in real time.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/06.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/02/grit-sequence-for-hardwood-versus-softwood-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/grit-sequence-for-hardwood-versus-softwood-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/02/grit-sequence-for-hardwood-versus-softwood-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/grit-sequence-for-hardwood-versus-softwood-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/02/grit-sequence-for-hardwood-versus-softwood-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/grit-sequence-for-hardwood-versus-softwood-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/02/grit-sequence-for-hardwood-versus-softwood-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/instagram/grit-sequence-for-hardwood-versus-softwood-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/02/grit-sequence-for-hardwood-versus-softwood-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/instagram/grit-sequence-for-hardwood-versus-softwood-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/02/grit-sequence-for-hardwood-versus-softwood-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/instagram/grit-sequence-for-hardwood-versus-softwood-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/02/grit-sequence-for-hardwood-versus-softwood-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/pinterest/grit-sequence-for-hardwood-versus-softwood-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/02/grit-sequence-for-hardwood-versus-softwood-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/pinterest/grit-sequence-for-hardwood-versus-softwood-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/02/grit-sequence-for-hardwood-versus-softwood-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/pinterest/grit-sequence-for-hardwood-versus-softwood-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/02/grit-sequence-for-hardwood-versus-softwood-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/grit-sequence-for-hardwood-versus-softwood-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/02/grit-sequence-for-hardwood-versus-softwood-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/grit-sequence-for-hardwood-versus-softwood-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/02/grit-sequence-for-hardwood-versus-softwood-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/grit-sequence-for-hardwood-versus-softwood-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>13</readingTime></item><item><title>Soft Interface Pad For Contour Sanding</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 13:38:32 +0000</pubDate><category>Hook-and-Loop Discs</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1200</category><description>Engineer-tested guide to soft interface pads for contour sanding and hook and loop sanding discs—materials, heat control, dust, and real-world results.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="hook-and-loop-sanding-discs-and-soft-interface-pads"&gt;Hook and Loop Sanding Discs and Soft Interface Pads&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early Sunday, the shop is quiet except for the soft thrum of a random-orbit sander. You’re easing into the inside radius of a chair arm, the kind of curve where the wood tells on you: one careless second and you’ve burned through stain on the edge. You swap to a softer setup—an interface pad between the pad and your hook and loop sanding discs—and the whole feel changes. The pad yields just enough to keep the abrasive in full contact along the curve, and the sander stops chattering. Your hands relax. The dust stream settles into the vacuum instead of fogging the bench light. The finish doesn’t scream for attention anymore; it whispers that you got the contour right.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/27.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Sequence Grits For Profiles And Corners</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 14:25:34 +0000</pubDate><category>Detail Sander Sheets</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><description>Engineer’s guide to sequencing grits for profiles and corners with detail sander sheets, including test-backed grit orders and pro tips for crisp edges</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="detail-sander-sheets-sequencing-grits-for-profiles"&gt;Detail sander sheets: sequencing grits for profiles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a Saturday morning in the shop, you pull the tape off a freshly routed maple picture frame and hit it with raking light. The ogee looks clean at first glance—but your fingertips catch tiny ridges where the cutter eased in and out, and the inside corners still show faint milling lines. You grab a delta sander, slide on a fresh pack of detail sander sheets, and take a breath. This is the moment that separates a merely “good enough” piece from one that reads crisp at arm’s length and holds up under a client’s inspection light.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/19.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets/cards/instagram/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets/cards/instagram/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets/cards/instagram/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets/cards/pinterest/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets/cards/pinterest/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets/cards/pinterest/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>13</readingTime></item><item><title>Recommended Grit Sequence For Sanding Bare Steel</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/27/recommended-grit-sequence-for-sanding-bare-steel-metal-surface-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/27/recommended-grit-sequence-for-sanding-bare-steel-metal-surface-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 27 Dec 2025 14:21:03 +0000</pubDate><category>Metal Polishing &amp; Rust Repair</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Learn the optimal grit sequence for sanding bare steel, with tooling, abrasives, and workflow guidance to maximize adhesion and finish quality.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="metal-surface-sanding-grit-sequence-for-bare-steel"&gt;Metal surface sanding: grit sequence for bare steel&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You notice it the moment the sander spins down: the hush after the rasp of grit on steel, the faint warmth still in the panel, the tiny constellation of scratch lines all pointing the same way. On Friday night, this fender looked tired—speckled with scale, a wisp of old primer clinging at the edges. Saturday morning it’s a blank canvas in progress, the steel alive again under clean, uniform scratch. Anyone who’s spent a weekend restoring a motorcycle tank or prepping a truck’s rocker knows the difference between “sanded” and “ready.” Metal surface sanding isn’t about making things shiny; it’s about engineering a surface profile that bonds mechanically with the next layer—primer, filler, sealer—without undercutting the geometry or telegraphing flaws. It’s a craft and a sequence, not just a tool choice.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/09.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/27/recommended-grit-sequence-for-sanding-bare-steel-metal-surface-sanding/cards/facebook/recommended-grit-sequence-for-sanding-bare-steel-metal-surface-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/27/recommended-grit-sequence-for-sanding-bare-steel-metal-surface-sanding/cards/facebook/recommended-grit-sequence-for-sanding-bare-steel-metal-surface-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/27/recommended-grit-sequence-for-sanding-bare-steel-metal-surface-sanding/cards/facebook/recommended-grit-sequence-for-sanding-bare-steel-metal-surface-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/27/recommended-grit-sequence-for-sanding-bare-steel-metal-surface-sanding/cards/instagram/recommended-grit-sequence-for-sanding-bare-steel-metal-surface-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/27/recommended-grit-sequence-for-sanding-bare-steel-metal-surface-sanding/cards/instagram/recommended-grit-sequence-for-sanding-bare-steel-metal-surface-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/27/recommended-grit-sequence-for-sanding-bare-steel-metal-surface-sanding/cards/instagram/recommended-grit-sequence-for-sanding-bare-steel-metal-surface-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/27/recommended-grit-sequence-for-sanding-bare-steel-metal-surface-sanding/cards/pinterest/recommended-grit-sequence-for-sanding-bare-steel-metal-surface-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/27/recommended-grit-sequence-for-sanding-bare-steel-metal-surface-sanding/cards/pinterest/recommended-grit-sequence-for-sanding-bare-steel-metal-surface-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/27/recommended-grit-sequence-for-sanding-bare-steel-metal-surface-sanding/cards/pinterest/recommended-grit-sequence-for-sanding-bare-steel-metal-surface-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/27/recommended-grit-sequence-for-sanding-bare-steel-metal-surface-sanding/cards/facebook/recommended-grit-sequence-for-sanding-bare-steel-metal-surface-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/27/recommended-grit-sequence-for-sanding-bare-steel-metal-surface-sanding/cards/facebook/recommended-grit-sequence-for-sanding-bare-steel-metal-surface-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/27/recommended-grit-sequence-for-sanding-bare-steel-metal-surface-sanding/cards/facebook/recommended-grit-sequence-for-sanding-bare-steel-metal-surface-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Da Sander Versus Random Orbital For Bodywork Preparation</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/25/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/25/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 13:37:54 +0000</pubDate><category>Auto Body Sanding</category><category>grit-40</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>orbital sander</category><description>Engineering review of DA vs RO sanding for car bodywork, with test data on removal rates, finish quality, abrasives, and cost to help you prep panels right.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="da-vs-ro-sanding-for-auto-bodywork-prep"&gt;DA vs RO sanding for Auto Bodywork Prep&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a cool Saturday morning, I wheeled a dented fender onto the stand, grabbed coffee, and stared at two sanders: a pneumatic 6-inch “DA” hanging from the air line, and a compact 5-inch corded random orbital sitting on the bench. The car—an aging hatchback—had a blend of bare metal, polyester filler, and feathered edges where clearcoat met primer. This is the exact moment many DIYers and even pros face: DA vs RO sanding for bodywork prep. You’re not choosing a philosophy; you’re choosing a process that affects dust control, scratch depth, shape fidelity, and the time you’ll spend chasing pigtails or re-spraying primer. I’ve felt the allure of the faster-cutting DA when leveling filler, and I’ve also learned the hard way that an aggressive orbit can tunnel through primer on a convex edge in seconds.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/03.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/25/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding/cards/facebook/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/25/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding/cards/facebook/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/25/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding/cards/facebook/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/25/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding/cards/instagram/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/25/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding/cards/instagram/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/25/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding/cards/instagram/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/25/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding/cards/pinterest/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/25/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding/cards/pinterest/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/25/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding/cards/pinterest/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/25/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding/cards/facebook/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/25/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding/cards/facebook/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/25/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding/cards/facebook/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>How To Sand Floors Without Chatter Marks</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/24/how-to-sand-floors-without-chatter-marks-floor-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/24/how-to-sand-floors-without-chatter-marks-floor-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 14:19:37 +0000</pubDate><category>Floor &amp; Deck Sanding</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-360</category><category>orbital sander</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Eliminate chatter marks with a precise floor sanding workflow—machine setup, abrasive sequencing, and surface prep techniques that produce flat, quiet floors.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="floor-sanding-without-chatter-a-pros-workflow"&gt;Floor Sanding Without Chatter: A Pro’s Workflow&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quiet house at sunrise, the kind of silence that makes you notice details. The boards gleam faintly where a rug used to sit, but everywhere else the finish is tired, dull, and scuffed. You roll the big sander off the truck, shoulders relaxed but eyes scanning for risk. This is where floor sanding gets real: the path between “good enough” and “exceptional” is only a few thousandths of an inch wide. Chatter marks—those rhythmic ripples the light will ruthlessly expose—are the difference. Once you see them, you can’t unsee them. And once they’re sealed under finish, they’ll stare back for years.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/01.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/24/how-to-sand-floors-without-chatter-marks-floor-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-floors-without-chatter-marks-floor-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/24/how-to-sand-floors-without-chatter-marks-floor-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-floors-without-chatter-marks-floor-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/24/how-to-sand-floors-without-chatter-marks-floor-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-floors-without-chatter-marks-floor-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/24/how-to-sand-floors-without-chatter-marks-floor-sanding/cards/instagram/how-to-sand-floors-without-chatter-marks-floor-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/24/how-to-sand-floors-without-chatter-marks-floor-sanding/cards/instagram/how-to-sand-floors-without-chatter-marks-floor-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/24/how-to-sand-floors-without-chatter-marks-floor-sanding/cards/instagram/how-to-sand-floors-without-chatter-marks-floor-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/24/how-to-sand-floors-without-chatter-marks-floor-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-to-sand-floors-without-chatter-marks-floor-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/24/how-to-sand-floors-without-chatter-marks-floor-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-to-sand-floors-without-chatter-marks-floor-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/24/how-to-sand-floors-without-chatter-marks-floor-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-to-sand-floors-without-chatter-marks-floor-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/24/how-to-sand-floors-without-chatter-marks-floor-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-floors-without-chatter-marks-floor-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/24/how-to-sand-floors-without-chatter-marks-floor-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-floors-without-chatter-marks-floor-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/24/how-to-sand-floors-without-chatter-marks-floor-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-floors-without-chatter-marks-floor-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Best Sandpaper Grits For Sanding Wood</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/22/best-sandpaper-grits-for-sanding-wood-wood-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/22/best-sandpaper-grits-for-sanding-wood-wood-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 13:40:09 +0000</pubDate><category>Wood sanding</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>orbital sander</category><category>dust control</category><description>Choose the best sandpaper grits for wood sanding.

&lt;p&gt;A Saturday morning sunbeam revealed everything—the faint planer tracks on a maple tabletop, a small divot near an edge, and those whisper-thin swirls you only notice after the first coat of finish. A project that looked “almost ready” under overhead light suddenly felt two steps backward under raking light. That moment is where quality begins: in choosing the right starting grit and a disciplined progression that erases, rather than buries, defects. This is the decisive difference between passable and professional surface prep.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/22.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/22/best-sandpaper-grits-for-sanding-wood-wood-sanding/cards/facebook/best-sandpaper-grits-for-sanding-wood-wood-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/22/best-sandpaper-grits-for-sanding-wood-wood-sanding/cards/facebook/best-sandpaper-grits-for-sanding-wood-wood-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/22/best-sandpaper-grits-for-sanding-wood-wood-sanding/cards/facebook/best-sandpaper-grits-for-sanding-wood-wood-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/22/best-sandpaper-grits-for-sanding-wood-wood-sanding/cards/instagram/best-sandpaper-grits-for-sanding-wood-wood-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/22/best-sandpaper-grits-for-sanding-wood-wood-sanding/cards/instagram/best-sandpaper-grits-for-sanding-wood-wood-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/22/best-sandpaper-grits-for-sanding-wood-wood-sanding/cards/instagram/best-sandpaper-grits-for-sanding-wood-wood-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/22/best-sandpaper-grits-for-sanding-wood-wood-sanding/cards/pinterest/best-sandpaper-grits-for-sanding-wood-wood-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/22/best-sandpaper-grits-for-sanding-wood-wood-sanding/cards/pinterest/best-sandpaper-grits-for-sanding-wood-wood-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/22/best-sandpaper-grits-for-sanding-wood-wood-sanding/cards/pinterest/best-sandpaper-grits-for-sanding-wood-wood-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/22/best-sandpaper-grits-for-sanding-wood-wood-sanding/cards/facebook/best-sandpaper-grits-for-sanding-wood-wood-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/22/best-sandpaper-grits-for-sanding-wood-wood-sanding/cards/facebook/best-sandpaper-grits-for-sanding-wood-wood-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/22/best-sandpaper-grits-for-sanding-wood-wood-sanding/cards/facebook/best-sandpaper-grits-for-sanding-wood-wood-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Controlled Swarf Collection For Analysis</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/21/controlled-swarf-collection-for-analysis-abrasive-testing/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/21/controlled-swarf-collection-for-analysis-abrasive-testing/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 21 Dec 2025 14:49:17 +0000</pubDate><category>Abrasive Innovation &amp; Testing</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>Learn controlled swarf collection for analysis—and how abrasive testing connects—to turn machining debris into reliable quality insights and process control.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="abrasive-testing-for-controlled-swarf-collection"&gt;Abrasive testing for controlled swarf collection&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a quiet Monday morning, a machinist starts the first job of the week: a batch of precision shafts destined for a medical device assembly. Surface finish is critical. The machine hums in a familiar rhythm while coolant sweeps away fine metallic specks. By noon, the parts look identical to last week’s, but a go/no-go fixture catches two shafts that slide just a hair too tightly. The QC technician squints under the microscope. Nothing obvious—no gouges, no burrs. Still, something changed. Was it the wheel dressing? A fresh lot of coolant concentrate? Microscopic wheel loading? Or a few degrees difference in coolant temperature? It’s in these moments—when visual checks aren’t enough—that controlled swarf collection for analysis becomes a lifeline.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/20.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/21/controlled-swarf-collection-for-analysis-abrasive-testing/cards/facebook/controlled-swarf-collection-for-analysis-abrasive-testing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/21/controlled-swarf-collection-for-analysis-abrasive-testing/cards/facebook/controlled-swarf-collection-for-analysis-abrasive-testing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/21/controlled-swarf-collection-for-analysis-abrasive-testing/cards/facebook/controlled-swarf-collection-for-analysis-abrasive-testing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/21/controlled-swarf-collection-for-analysis-abrasive-testing/cards/instagram/controlled-swarf-collection-for-analysis-abrasive-testing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/21/controlled-swarf-collection-for-analysis-abrasive-testing/cards/instagram/controlled-swarf-collection-for-analysis-abrasive-testing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/21/controlled-swarf-collection-for-analysis-abrasive-testing/cards/instagram/controlled-swarf-collection-for-analysis-abrasive-testing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/21/controlled-swarf-collection-for-analysis-abrasive-testing/cards/pinterest/controlled-swarf-collection-for-analysis-abrasive-testing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/21/controlled-swarf-collection-for-analysis-abrasive-testing/cards/pinterest/controlled-swarf-collection-for-analysis-abrasive-testing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/21/controlled-swarf-collection-for-analysis-abrasive-testing/cards/pinterest/controlled-swarf-collection-for-analysis-abrasive-testing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/21/controlled-swarf-collection-for-analysis-abrasive-testing/cards/facebook/controlled-swarf-collection-for-analysis-abrasive-testing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/21/controlled-swarf-collection-for-analysis-abrasive-testing/cards/facebook/controlled-swarf-collection-for-analysis-abrasive-testing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/21/controlled-swarf-collection-for-analysis-abrasive-testing/cards/facebook/controlled-swarf-collection-for-analysis-abrasive-testing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>How To Keep Pressure Even During Hand Sanding</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/21/how-to-keep-pressure-even-during-hand-sanding-hand-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/21/how-to-keep-pressure-even-during-hand-sanding-hand-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 21 Dec 2025 13:33:29 +0000</pubDate><category>Hand Sanding Techniques</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-220</category><category>sanding block</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Learn how to keep pressure even during hand sanding with pro body mechanics, blocks, grit strategy, and checks for perfect flats and curves.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="even-pressure-mastery-in-hand-sanding"&gt;Even Pressure Mastery in Hand Sanding&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fresh sheet of paper crackles between your fingers as you kneel beside a project you’ve put your evenings into—a walnut coffee table top you milled by hand, or maybe a maple guitar body you’ve been carving between jobs. You tell yourself it’s “just sanding,” but you know better. One wrong move and a finger groove shows up under the finish. One heavy corner and the veneer starts to whisper thin. The difference between amateur and pro often shows up right here, during hand sanding, in the quiet, repetitive passes that bring wood to life.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/18.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/21/how-to-keep-pressure-even-during-hand-sanding-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-keep-pressure-even-during-hand-sanding-hand-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/21/how-to-keep-pressure-even-during-hand-sanding-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-keep-pressure-even-during-hand-sanding-hand-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/21/how-to-keep-pressure-even-during-hand-sanding-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-keep-pressure-even-during-hand-sanding-hand-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/21/how-to-keep-pressure-even-during-hand-sanding-hand-sanding/cards/instagram/how-to-keep-pressure-even-during-hand-sanding-hand-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/21/how-to-keep-pressure-even-during-hand-sanding-hand-sanding/cards/instagram/how-to-keep-pressure-even-during-hand-sanding-hand-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/21/how-to-keep-pressure-even-during-hand-sanding-hand-sanding/cards/instagram/how-to-keep-pressure-even-during-hand-sanding-hand-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/21/how-to-keep-pressure-even-during-hand-sanding-hand-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-to-keep-pressure-even-during-hand-sanding-hand-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/21/how-to-keep-pressure-even-during-hand-sanding-hand-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-to-keep-pressure-even-during-hand-sanding-hand-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/21/how-to-keep-pressure-even-during-hand-sanding-hand-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-to-keep-pressure-even-during-hand-sanding-hand-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/21/how-to-keep-pressure-even-during-hand-sanding-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-keep-pressure-even-during-hand-sanding-hand-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/21/how-to-keep-pressure-even-during-hand-sanding-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-keep-pressure-even-during-hand-sanding-hand-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/21/how-to-keep-pressure-even-during-hand-sanding-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-keep-pressure-even-during-hand-sanding-hand-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>13</readingTime></item><item><title>Recycling Options For Used Abrasives</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/recycling-options-for-used-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/recycling-options-for-used-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 20 Dec 2025 15:27:17 +0000</pubDate><category>Eco &amp; Non-Toxic Abrasives</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>dry sanding</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Tested routes to recycle used abrasives—eco sandpaper, belts, discs, and media—with data-driven tips, partner options, and shop-ready sorting methods.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="eco-sandpaper-recycling-practical-paths-that-work"&gt;Eco Sandpaper Recycling: Practical Paths That Work&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning, the garage smells like cedar and coffee. My benchtop sander hums a steady rhythm while early light catches the swirls of dust in the air. I’m finishing a bookshelf for my daughter’s room, working through the grits like a metronome: P80, P120, P180. The stack of spent discs grows, their once-sharp grains dulled to amber haze. I pause—one hand on the vacuum hose, the other hovering over the trash bin—and feel that sting of waste. Ever since I switched to an eco sandpaper lineup for shop trials, I’ve noticed the tension more acutely: I want clean finishes and predictable cut rates, but I also want less landfill, fewer microplastics, and smarter material loops. Those disks, belts, and sheets are composites of minerals, resins, and fiber backings; they don’t slot neatly into a blue bin. Tossing them feels like erasing the upstream energy embedded in alumina and binders—the mining, firing, and curing that gave them bite.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/16.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/recycling-options-for-used-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/recycling-options-for-used-abrasives-eco-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/recycling-options-for-used-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/recycling-options-for-used-abrasives-eco-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/recycling-options-for-used-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/recycling-options-for-used-abrasives-eco-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/recycling-options-for-used-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/cards/instagram/recycling-options-for-used-abrasives-eco-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/recycling-options-for-used-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/cards/instagram/recycling-options-for-used-abrasives-eco-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/recycling-options-for-used-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/cards/instagram/recycling-options-for-used-abrasives-eco-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/recycling-options-for-used-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/recycling-options-for-used-abrasives-eco-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/recycling-options-for-used-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/recycling-options-for-used-abrasives-eco-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/recycling-options-for-used-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/recycling-options-for-used-abrasives-eco-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/recycling-options-for-used-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/recycling-options-for-used-abrasives-eco-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/recycling-options-for-used-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/recycling-options-for-used-abrasives-eco-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/recycling-options-for-used-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/recycling-options-for-used-abrasives-eco-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>13</readingTime></item><item><title>Price Versus Performance Over Time</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 20 Dec 2025 14:25:50 +0000</pubDate><category>Brand &amp; Quality Comparison</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><description>A technical guide to selecting the best sandpaper brand for long-term value—cut rate, lifespan, surface quality, and workflow efficiency.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="choosing-the-best-sandpaper-brand-for-long-term-value"&gt;Choosing the best sandpaper brand for long-term value&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning, the shop is quiet except for the steady whirr of a 5-inch random-orbit sander. You watch the dust plume flatten as the extractor spools up, then feel the pad settle onto a maple panel you’ve jointed and planed true. The first passes feel crisp—rapid cut, clean scratch pattern, no chatter. Then the feedback shifts. Heat creeps in. The pad skates slightly, cutting less and loading more. You flip the disc, glance at the resin smear, and do the quick math we all do when we care about price versus performance over time: how many panels per disc, and what did it actually cost to get this surface ready for finish? This is why the question of the best sandpaper brand is never just about brand—it’s about measurable throughput, surface quality, and the total cost of consistency.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/14.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/facebook/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/facebook/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/facebook/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/instagram/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/instagram/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/instagram/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/pinterest/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/pinterest/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/pinterest/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/facebook/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/facebook/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/facebook/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Anti Clog Design For Painted Surfaces</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/anti-clog-design-for-painted-surfaces-open-coat-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/anti-clog-design-for-painted-surfaces-open-coat-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 20 Dec 2025 13:33:05 +0000</pubDate><category>Backing Types &amp; Coatings</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>dry sanding</category><category>sanding block</category><description>Learn how open coat sandpaper and anti-clog coatings deliver smoother results on painted surfaces, with pro tips, gear choices, and troubleshooting.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="open-coat-sandpaper-for-painted-surfaces"&gt;Open Coat Sandpaper for Painted Surfaces&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The weekend starts with a small promise to yourself: fresh paint, clean lines, a room that feels lighter when you walk in. But before the color goes up, something else has to come down—old paint, a rough patch, a drippy corner where the brush ran heavy last time. You pull out a sheet of sandpaper and, for a few strokes, it feels right. Then the dust rolls into pills, the sheet clogs, the finish scratches, and you’re wondering why this simple prep step feels like a fight. If you’ve ever paused mid-sand to pick off gummy paint from your paper, you’ve already met the enemy. The fix doesn’t start with elbow grease; it starts with choosing the right abrasive. On painted surfaces, open coat sandpaper—often paired with an anti-clog “no-fill” layer—doesn’t just last longer; it changes the way the surface behaves while you work.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/12.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/anti-clog-design-for-painted-surfaces-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/anti-clog-design-for-painted-surfaces-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/anti-clog-design-for-painted-surfaces-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/anti-clog-design-for-painted-surfaces-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/anti-clog-design-for-painted-surfaces-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/anti-clog-design-for-painted-surfaces-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/anti-clog-design-for-painted-surfaces-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/instagram/anti-clog-design-for-painted-surfaces-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/anti-clog-design-for-painted-surfaces-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/instagram/anti-clog-design-for-painted-surfaces-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/anti-clog-design-for-painted-surfaces-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/instagram/anti-clog-design-for-painted-surfaces-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/anti-clog-design-for-painted-surfaces-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/anti-clog-design-for-painted-surfaces-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/anti-clog-design-for-painted-surfaces-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/anti-clog-design-for-painted-surfaces-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/anti-clog-design-for-painted-surfaces-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/anti-clog-design-for-painted-surfaces-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/anti-clog-design-for-painted-surfaces-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/anti-clog-design-for-painted-surfaces-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/anti-clog-design-for-painted-surfaces-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/anti-clog-design-for-painted-surfaces-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/anti-clog-design-for-painted-surfaces-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/anti-clog-design-for-painted-surfaces-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Film Versus Paper Backing With Grains</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 17:25:57 +0000</pubDate><category>Abrasive Materials &amp; Compounds</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><description>Film vs paper sandpaper backings explained with grain choices like silicon carbide, plus pro tips for wet/dry sanding and flawless finishes.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="film-vs-paper-backing-with-silicon-carbide-sandpaper"&gt;Film vs Paper Backing with Silicon Carbide Sandpaper&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday mornings in the shop start the same for me: kettle on, soft sun across the bench, and a project at that satisfying almost-there stage. I’d been chasing a glass-flat finish on a walnut desk with an epoxy river, and the last pass was fighting me—tiny swirls that only showed in raking light. I’d been sanding wet to keep dust down, but the paper kept going mushy at the edges. That’s when I swapped in film-backed silicon carbide sandpaper I’d stashed for auto body work. The difference was immediate: the sheet kept its shape, water beaded and carried the swarf away, and the scratch pattern evened out in a few clean passes. The surface went quiet—no chatter, just controlled cutting.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/10.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/instagram/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/instagram/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/instagram/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Edge Control Around Hardware And Seams</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 13:38:27 +0000</pubDate><category>Marine Sanding</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-280</category><category>grit-320</category><description>Advanced boat sanding techniques for edge control around hardware and seams, from abrasives and pads to workflows that protect profiles and finish quality.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="boat-sanding-mastery-edges-hardware-seams"&gt;Boat sanding mastery: edges, hardware, seams&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dock still smells of salt and diesel when you pull the cover back at first light. The hull prints the sunrise in dull reflections, beautiful from afar but cruel up close—pigtails, flat spots, and a halo of scuffs around the stanchion bases where an impatient hand once grazed the gelcoat. Today is about restraint as much as cutting power. Boat sanding isn’t hard in principle; it’s hard because boats are a collage of edges, radii, seams, and fasteners that punish every lapse in control. A random orbital can fair a panel in minutes, then choke at a cleat, overcut a toe rail, or trench a seam if you don’t recalibrate your technique and consumables for the geometry in front of you.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/06.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding/cards/instagram/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding/cards/instagram/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding/cards/instagram/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding/cards/pinterest/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding/cards/pinterest/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding/cards/pinterest/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Keep Heat Low To Prevent Softening</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 17 Dec 2025 14:27:08 +0000</pubDate><category>Plastic &amp; Epoxy Sanding</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>wet sanding</category><description>Engineer-tested guide to epoxy sanding without softening.

&lt;p&gt;The room is quiet except for the soft whirr of a 5-inch random orbital sander. You’ve invested hours pouring a resin river through a slab of maple, watched the swirl of pigment lock under crystal clarity, and now you’re finally leveling the surface for that glass-smooth finish. Then it happens—under the pad, the epoxy feels different. The sander drags, the dust turns to smeary ribbons, and the finish dulls into a gummy haze. If you’ve experienced that sinking feeling, you’ve already met the enemy of precision finishing: heat buildup.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/29.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding/cards/instagram/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding/cards/instagram/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding/cards/instagram/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding/cards/pinterest/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding/cards/pinterest/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding/cards/pinterest/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>When To Drop Back A Grit To Fix Defects</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/15/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/15/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 15 Dec 2025 13:46:21 +0000</pubDate><category>Grit Range &amp; Classification</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><description>Practical rules and tests to know when to drop back sandpaper grit to remove defects without over-sanding, from wood and resin to automotive clear coat.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="when-to-drop-back-sandpaper-grit-to-fix-defects"&gt;When to Drop Back Sandpaper Grit to Fix Defects&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning. Coffee cooling on the bench, raking light cutting across your project like a truth serum. You wanted a quick scuff-and-recoat—thirty minutes, tops. Instead, the panel keeps whispering back at you: that line near the edge, the mysterious dull patch that won’t clear, the faint spiral that appears only at a certain angle. You switch sheets, then pressure, then motion, but the micro-scratches stubbornly telegraph through. It’s the universal moment where your patience meets physics: do you keep climbing up the sequence or drop back a sandpaper grit to reset the scratch pattern?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/21.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/15/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/15/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/15/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/15/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit/cards/instagram/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/15/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit/cards/instagram/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/15/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit/cards/instagram/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/15/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit/cards/pinterest/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/15/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit/cards/pinterest/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/15/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit/cards/pinterest/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/15/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/15/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/15/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Final Grit Selection By Finish Type</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/14/final-grit-selection-by-finish-type-sandpaper-grit-chart/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/14/final-grit-selection-by-finish-type-sandpaper-grit-chart/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 14 Dec 2025 13:33:32 +0000</pubDate><category>Grit Guide &amp; Education</category><category>grit chart</category><category>abrasive standards</category><category>grit progression</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-101</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><description>Clear, expert guidance on final grit selection by finish type.

&lt;p&gt;It’s 8:40 p.m. in a quiet shop, and the last pass of the sander will decide everything. The walnut dresser is leveled, drawer faces are flush, and you’ve already tuned the edges by hand. What remains is the final grit choice—the one that determines whether an oil finish glows with depth, a waterborne polyurethane keys properly, or a lacquer topcoat lays down glass-flat. This is where a sandpaper grit chart becomes more than a table of numbers; it’s a translation key between surface profile, abrasive behavior, and finish chemistry. Choose carelessly and you’ll fight adhesion problems, washed-out figure, or telegraphed swirl marks. Choose well and the finish rewards you with clarity, durability, and speed.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/19.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/14/final-grit-selection-by-finish-type-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/final-grit-selection-by-finish-type-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/14/final-grit-selection-by-finish-type-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/final-grit-selection-by-finish-type-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/14/final-grit-selection-by-finish-type-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/final-grit-selection-by-finish-type-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/14/final-grit-selection-by-finish-type-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/instagram/final-grit-selection-by-finish-type-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/14/final-grit-selection-by-finish-type-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/instagram/final-grit-selection-by-finish-type-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/14/final-grit-selection-by-finish-type-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/instagram/final-grit-selection-by-finish-type-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/14/final-grit-selection-by-finish-type-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/pinterest/final-grit-selection-by-finish-type-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/14/final-grit-selection-by-finish-type-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/pinterest/final-grit-selection-by-finish-type-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/14/final-grit-selection-by-finish-type-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/pinterest/final-grit-selection-by-finish-type-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/14/final-grit-selection-by-finish-type-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/final-grit-selection-by-finish-type-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/14/final-grit-selection-by-finish-type-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/final-grit-selection-by-finish-type-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/14/final-grit-selection-by-finish-type-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/final-grit-selection-by-finish-type-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Vacuum Hookup For Dustless Orbital Sanding</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/vacuum-hookup-for-dustless-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/vacuum-hookup-for-dustless-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 10 Dec 2025 15:13:40 +0000</pubDate><category>Random Orbital Sanding</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>dust control</category><category>orbital sander</category><description>Achieve dustless results with smart vacuum hookups for random orbital sanding.

&lt;p&gt;The first time you see true “dustless” sanding, it feels like cheating. The room stays clear, your lungs don’t protest, and the surface looks better with each pass. I remember a Saturday morning in a small basement shop—coffee steaming, maple table top ready, and my playlist queued up—when a familiar dread crept in. I loved building things, but I hated the blizzard of dust that came with it. It wove into sweaters, clung to eyelashes, and added an hour of cleanup to every project. That day, I swapped my old hose for a snug-fitting antistatic one, dialed the vacuum to the sweet spot, and tried random orbital sanding with the vac hooked up. Ten minutes later, I realized I was breathing easier. The snowstorm never came.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/01.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/vacuum-hookup-for-dustless-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/vacuum-hookup-for-dustless-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/vacuum-hookup-for-dustless-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/vacuum-hookup-for-dustless-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/vacuum-hookup-for-dustless-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/vacuum-hookup-for-dustless-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/vacuum-hookup-for-dustless-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/instagram/vacuum-hookup-for-dustless-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/vacuum-hookup-for-dustless-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/instagram/vacuum-hookup-for-dustless-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/vacuum-hookup-for-dustless-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/instagram/vacuum-hookup-for-dustless-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/vacuum-hookup-for-dustless-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/pinterest/vacuum-hookup-for-dustless-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/vacuum-hookup-for-dustless-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/pinterest/vacuum-hookup-for-dustless-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/vacuum-hookup-for-dustless-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/pinterest/vacuum-hookup-for-dustless-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/vacuum-hookup-for-dustless-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/vacuum-hookup-for-dustless-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/vacuum-hookup-for-dustless-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/vacuum-hookup-for-dustless-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/10/vacuum-hookup-for-dustless-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/vacuum-hookup-for-dustless-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Epa Rrp Containment Setup For Lead Paint Sanding</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 15:44:17 +0000</pubDate><category>Paint Removal &amp; Surface Prep</category><category>paint prep</category><category>rust removal</category><category>primer coat</category><category>sanding block</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><description>A technical guide to EPA RRP containment for lead-safe sanding, covering surface prep, abrasive selection, HEPA capture, and low-dust workflows.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="epa-rrp-containment-for-lead-safe-sanding"&gt;EPA RRP Containment for Lead-Safe Sanding&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a moment, right before the sander touches the surface, when a room holds its breath. You’ve taped the vents, rolled up area rugs, shuffled furniture to the hallway. In an older home—maybe one built just after the war, with trim thick enough to show paint strata like tree rings—you feel the weight of history in the baseboards and widow’s walk. You also feel responsibility. Dust is memory made airborne, and when that dust contains lead, it crosses the boundary from nuisance to long-term health hazard in seconds. The job becomes less about “cleaning up later” and more about “controlling everything now.” That’s precisely where epa rrp containment setup lives, and it’s the fulcrum between craftsmanship and care.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/24.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding/cards/facebook/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding/cards/facebook/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding/cards/facebook/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding/cards/instagram/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding/cards/instagram/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding/cards/instagram/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding/cards/pinterest/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding/cards/pinterest/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding/cards/pinterest/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding/cards/facebook/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding/cards/facebook/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding/cards/facebook/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Grind Out Rust And Feather Edges For Patch Repair</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 14:44:40 +0000</pubDate><category>Metal Polishing &amp; Rust Repair</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>rust removal</category><description>Learn rust repair the right way: grind out corrosion, feather paint edges, and patch cleanly for durable, near-invisible automotive fixes.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="rust-repair-101-grind-feather-and-patch-like-pro"&gt;Rust Repair 101: Grind, Feather, and Patch Like Pro&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The moment you notice it is rarely dramatic. Maybe you’re pouring your first cup of coffee, the driveway still cool in the morning shade, when a small bubble on the wheel arch catches your eye. It wasn’t there last summer. You press lightly; the paint flexes and flattens like a blister. It’s a tiny flaw, easy to ignore while the engine warms and the day rushes in. But you know how rust works. It doesn’t wait. It keeps chewing, one quiet day after another, under glossy paint where you can’t see it.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/22.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair/cards/facebook/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair/cards/facebook/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair/cards/facebook/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair/cards/instagram/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair/cards/instagram/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair/cards/instagram/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair/cards/pinterest/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair/cards/pinterest/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair/cards/pinterest/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair/cards/facebook/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair/cards/facebook/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair/cards/facebook/grind-out-rust-and-feather-edges-for-patch-repair-rust-repair.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Apply Dry Guide Coat Evenly Over Primer Before Blocking</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2025 13:40:28 +0000</pubDate><category>Auto Body Sanding</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-500</category><category>grit-600</category><category>dust control</category><description>Learn how to apply a dry guide coat evenly over primer and block panels with precision.

&lt;p&gt;The shop is quiet except for the hiss of air through a regulator and the faint tick of cooling metal. You’ve just laid down a uniform film of high-build primer on a long quarter panel, the kind with a subtle crown that punishes any lapse in technique. Under raking LEDs, the surface looks good—flat at a glance, gray and matte like it should. But you know better. Until you perform disciplined guide coat sanding, there’s no honest way to read the surface. The panel has its history: tap-down marks from the last round of metalwork, a skim of filler you were careful not to overshape, and a featheredge that transitions into OEM finish along the dogleg. If any area is slightly low, the topcoat will amplify it like a megaphone.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/16.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding/cards/facebook/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding/cards/facebook/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding/cards/facebook/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding/cards/instagram/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding/cards/instagram/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding/cards/instagram/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding/cards/pinterest/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding/cards/pinterest/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding/cards/pinterest/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding/cards/facebook/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding/cards/facebook/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding/cards/facebook/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>13</readingTime></item><item><title>Smooth Fairing Compound Before Primer</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/02/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/02/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 02 Dec 2025 13:43:25 +0000</pubDate><category>Marine Sanding</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>dry sanding</category><category>primer coat</category><description>Master boat sanding and fairing for a glass-smooth base before primer.

&lt;p&gt;You can hear it before you see it: the soft rasp of paper across gelcoat, the shush-shush rhythm that turns a scuffed hull into something you can be proud of. Boat sanding isn’t exactly glamorous, but on a still morning—coffee perched on a dock post, gulls trading gossip overhead—it feels like craft. Your fingers become the first inspectors, gliding across highs and lows. The goal isn’t just clean; it’s consistent. When you’re aiming for smooth fairing compound before primer, you’re making a commitment to what comes next: paint that lays down like glass, reflections that don’t ripple, and time on the water that starts sooner because you did the prep right.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/19.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/02/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/02/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/02/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/02/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding/cards/instagram/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/02/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding/cards/instagram/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/02/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding/cards/instagram/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/02/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding/cards/pinterest/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/02/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding/cards/pinterest/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/02/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding/cards/pinterest/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/02/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/02/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/02/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Verify Scratch Removal Before Moving Up</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/28/verify-scratch-removal-before-moving-up-sandpaper-grit-chart/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/28/verify-scratch-removal-before-moving-up-sandpaper-grit-chart/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 28 Nov 2025 14:38:49 +0000</pubDate><category>Grit Guide &amp; Education</category><category>grit chart</category><category>abrasive standards</category><category>grit progression</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><description>How to verify scratch removal before moving up grits, using a sandpaper grit chart, lighting, and workflow controls for flawless finishes.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="sandpaper-grit-chart-verify-scratches-before-upgrading"&gt;Sandpaper Grit Chart: Verify Scratches Before Upgrading&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a quiet Saturday morning, you clamp down a panel you’ve been saving for a fresh finish—maybe a guitar body, a dresser drawer front, or a primered door skin. Coffee’s cooling. The shop is clean, the plan is set, and your stack of abrasives sits like a neatly organized ladder next to your bench. You’ve mapped your progression: P120 for shaping, P180 to refine, P220 to remove print-through, then P320 for primer surfacing. A sandpaper grit chart is within reach, annotated with your go-to sequences. The temptation is strong to move briskly through those steps. After all, each finer grit will “clean up” the last, right?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/05.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/28/verify-scratch-removal-before-moving-up-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/verify-scratch-removal-before-moving-up-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/28/verify-scratch-removal-before-moving-up-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/verify-scratch-removal-before-moving-up-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/28/verify-scratch-removal-before-moving-up-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/verify-scratch-removal-before-moving-up-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/28/verify-scratch-removal-before-moving-up-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/instagram/verify-scratch-removal-before-moving-up-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/28/verify-scratch-removal-before-moving-up-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/instagram/verify-scratch-removal-before-moving-up-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/28/verify-scratch-removal-before-moving-up-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/instagram/verify-scratch-removal-before-moving-up-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/28/verify-scratch-removal-before-moving-up-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/pinterest/verify-scratch-removal-before-moving-up-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/28/verify-scratch-removal-before-moving-up-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/pinterest/verify-scratch-removal-before-moving-up-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/28/verify-scratch-removal-before-moving-up-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/pinterest/verify-scratch-removal-before-moving-up-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/28/verify-scratch-removal-before-moving-up-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/verify-scratch-removal-before-moving-up-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/28/verify-scratch-removal-before-moving-up-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/verify-scratch-removal-before-moving-up-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/28/verify-scratch-removal-before-moving-up-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/verify-scratch-removal-before-moving-up-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Sponge Versus Paper On Curved Surfaces</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 15:39:58 +0000</pubDate><category>Sanding Sponges</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>grit progression</category><category>sanding block</category><category>dust control</category><description>Learn when a sanding sponge outperforms paper on curves.

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve ever stood in your garage at 9 p.m., holding a cup of coffee with one hand and a carved table leg with the other, you know the moment: the curve looks great until you touch it with the wrong abrasive. Flat spots appear, sharp lines soften, and suddenly the piece loses the crisp profile you loved. I’ve been there countless times—chair arms, bowl rims, crown molding returns—each one begging for finesse. The first time I switched from paper to a sanding sponge mid-project, it felt like I’d finally turned down the static and could hear the wood speaking again. The foam hugged the profile, didn’t dig in, and let me smooth without erasing detail.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/22.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge/cards/instagram/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge/cards/instagram/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge/cards/instagram/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge/cards/pinterest/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge/cards/pinterest/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge/cards/pinterest/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>13</readingTime></item><item><title>Wrap Sandpaper Correctly On A Block</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 14:51:04 +0000</pubDate><category>Sanding Blocks</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>sanding block</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>dry sanding</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Learn how to wrap sandpaper on a sanding block for flat, fast, scratch-free results.

&lt;p&gt;I still remember the first shelf I built for our entryway—a simple maple plank resting on two brackets, meant to hold keys and a couple of planters. The board came out of the planer with faint ripples; the chamfers were uneven; and the finish looked decent from six feet away but not when the morning light hit. I did what many DIYers do: grabbed a sheet of paper, wrapped it around a block haphazardly, and pushed until my fingers ached. The final surface was smooth-ish, but I had shallow waves and rounded corners that betrayed the lack of control. Only after I switched to a properly wrapped sanding block did the maple flatten, the scratch pattern tighten, and my edges stay crisp.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/20.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block/cards/facebook/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block/cards/facebook/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block/cards/facebook/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block/cards/instagram/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block/cards/instagram/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block/cards/instagram/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block/cards/facebook/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block/cards/facebook/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block/cards/facebook/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>13</readingTime></item><item><title>Avoid Rounding Edges During Detail Sanding</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/avoid-rounding-edges-during-detail-sanding-detail-sander-sheets/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/avoid-rounding-edges-during-detail-sanding-detail-sander-sheets/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 13:39:01 +0000</pubDate><category>Detail Sander Sheets</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>dust control</category><category>orbital sander</category><category>sanding block</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Keep edges crisp: pro techniques, sheet choices, and workflows to avoid rounding during detail sanding with precision abrasive control.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="how-to-avoid-rounding-edges-with-detail-sander-sheets"&gt;How to Avoid Rounding Edges with Detail Sander Sheets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A crisp edge is honesty you can feel. You run a fingertip along the rail of a cabinet door or the rim of a keepsake box and know immediately whether the prep was careful or hurried. The line should be true—straight, sharp, and confident—not washed out by a power sander that wobbled a hair too long at the corner. The irony is familiar: we reach for a small triangular sander to finesse tight spaces, then watch it soften what we wanted to preserve. If you’ve ever started a job with a fresh pack of detail sander sheets, only to end it with unintentionally eased profiles, this guide is for you.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/18.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/avoid-rounding-edges-during-detail-sanding-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/avoid-rounding-edges-during-detail-sanding-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/avoid-rounding-edges-during-detail-sanding-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/avoid-rounding-edges-during-detail-sanding-detail-sander-sheets.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/avoid-rounding-edges-during-detail-sanding-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/avoid-rounding-edges-during-detail-sanding-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/avoid-rounding-edges-during-detail-sanding-detail-sander-sheets/cards/instagram/avoid-rounding-edges-during-detail-sanding-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/avoid-rounding-edges-during-detail-sanding-detail-sander-sheets/cards/instagram/avoid-rounding-edges-during-detail-sanding-detail-sander-sheets.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/avoid-rounding-edges-during-detail-sanding-detail-sander-sheets/cards/instagram/avoid-rounding-edges-during-detail-sanding-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/avoid-rounding-edges-during-detail-sanding-detail-sander-sheets/cards/pinterest/avoid-rounding-edges-during-detail-sanding-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/avoid-rounding-edges-during-detail-sanding-detail-sander-sheets/cards/pinterest/avoid-rounding-edges-during-detail-sanding-detail-sander-sheets.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/avoid-rounding-edges-during-detail-sanding-detail-sander-sheets/cards/pinterest/avoid-rounding-edges-during-detail-sanding-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/avoid-rounding-edges-during-detail-sanding-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/avoid-rounding-edges-during-detail-sanding-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/avoid-rounding-edges-during-detail-sanding-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/avoid-rounding-edges-during-detail-sanding-detail-sander-sheets.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/avoid-rounding-edges-during-detail-sanding-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/avoid-rounding-edges-during-detail-sanding-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Best Interface Pad For Curved Surfaces</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 18:06:15 +0000</pubDate><category>Random Orbital Sanding</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>Learn how to choose the best interface pad for curved surfaces and master random orbital sanding for cleaner contours, fewer swirls, and better control.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="best-interface-pads-for-curves-in-random-orbital-sanding"&gt;Best Interface Pads for Curves in Random Orbital Sanding&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You notice it the moment you run your hand across a curved armrest you’ve just sanded: the shape is smoother, yet somehow flatter than you hoped. The ridge that gave the piece personality has softened a little too much; the transition from convex to concave feels vague. You step back, eyes scanning for the culprit, and there it is—tiny half-moons glinting in the light. Swirl marks. Anyone who’s tried to sand a contoured chair leg, a guitar body, a carved cabinet door, or even a rounded countertop edge has felt this mix of pride and frustration. You’ve done the hard work of shaping. Now the surface needs finesse without losing its curves.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/16.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding/cards/instagram/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding/cards/instagram/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding/cards/instagram/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding/cards/pinterest/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding/cards/pinterest/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding/cards/pinterest/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Block Sanding Techniques To Straighten Wavy Panels</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/block-sanding-techniques-to-straighten-wavy-panels-block-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/block-sanding-techniques-to-straighten-wavy-panels-block-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 22 Nov 2025 00:39:32 +0000</pubDate><category>Auto Body Sanding</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit progression</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>mirror finish</category><description>Master block sanding to straighten wavy panels.

&lt;p&gt;The first time you notice the wave is rarely under shop fluorescents. It’s usually on a quiet evening, when the sun sits low and your freshly primed quarter panel mirrors a rippling skyline instead of a straight horizon. You run a hand over the surface—smooth, no pinholes, no obvious highs—yet the reflection trembles as if it remembers every hammer blow. That’s the moment every builder meets the truth: paint doesn’t hide shape. Only block sanding, done methodically with the right abrasives, pressure, and board geometry, can translate good bodywork into panels that read as laser-straight in unforgiving light.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/02.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/block-sanding-techniques-to-straighten-wavy-panels-block-sanding/cards/facebook/block-sanding-techniques-to-straighten-wavy-panels-block-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/block-sanding-techniques-to-straighten-wavy-panels-block-sanding/cards/facebook/block-sanding-techniques-to-straighten-wavy-panels-block-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/block-sanding-techniques-to-straighten-wavy-panels-block-sanding/cards/facebook/block-sanding-techniques-to-straighten-wavy-panels-block-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/block-sanding-techniques-to-straighten-wavy-panels-block-sanding/cards/instagram/block-sanding-techniques-to-straighten-wavy-panels-block-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/block-sanding-techniques-to-straighten-wavy-panels-block-sanding/cards/instagram/block-sanding-techniques-to-straighten-wavy-panels-block-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/block-sanding-techniques-to-straighten-wavy-panels-block-sanding/cards/instagram/block-sanding-techniques-to-straighten-wavy-panels-block-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/block-sanding-techniques-to-straighten-wavy-panels-block-sanding/cards/pinterest/block-sanding-techniques-to-straighten-wavy-panels-block-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/block-sanding-techniques-to-straighten-wavy-panels-block-sanding/cards/pinterest/block-sanding-techniques-to-straighten-wavy-panels-block-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/block-sanding-techniques-to-straighten-wavy-panels-block-sanding/cards/pinterest/block-sanding-techniques-to-straighten-wavy-panels-block-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/block-sanding-techniques-to-straighten-wavy-panels-block-sanding/cards/facebook/block-sanding-techniques-to-straighten-wavy-panels-block-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/block-sanding-techniques-to-straighten-wavy-panels-block-sanding/cards/facebook/block-sanding-techniques-to-straighten-wavy-panels-block-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/block-sanding-techniques-to-straighten-wavy-panels-block-sanding/cards/facebook/block-sanding-techniques-to-straighten-wavy-panels-block-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>How To Use A Drum Sander Without Gouging The Floor</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/how-to-use-a-drum-sander-without-gouging-the-floor-drum-sander/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/how-to-use-a-drum-sander-without-gouging-the-floor-drum-sander/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 22 Nov 2025 00:17:02 +0000</pubDate><category>Floor &amp; Deck Sanding</category><category>grit-40</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>dust control</category><category>dry sanding</category><category>orbital sander</category><description>Learn how to use a drum sander safely and smoothly to refinish hardwood floors without gouges, from setup and technique to edges, dust, and final prep.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="how-to-use-a-drum-sander-without-gouging-floors"&gt;How to Use a Drum Sander Without Gouging Floors&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a specific quiet that fills the house once the furniture is moved and the rugs are rolled away. You stand in that new emptiness and see every scuff and dent that daily life has pressed into your hardwood—sun-faded planks by the windows, chair-leg tracks under the table, and a dark, worn path that arcs toward the kitchen. Maybe you’ve watched a few videos and read some forum threads, and now the rental center’s phone number is staring you down. The idea of a sparkling new finish is thrilling. The idea of gouging the floor with a poorly handled drum sander? Not so much.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/29.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/how-to-use-a-drum-sander-without-gouging-the-floor-drum-sander/cards/facebook/how-to-use-a-drum-sander-without-gouging-the-floor-drum-sander.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/how-to-use-a-drum-sander-without-gouging-the-floor-drum-sander/cards/facebook/how-to-use-a-drum-sander-without-gouging-the-floor-drum-sander.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/how-to-use-a-drum-sander-without-gouging-the-floor-drum-sander/cards/facebook/how-to-use-a-drum-sander-without-gouging-the-floor-drum-sander.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/how-to-use-a-drum-sander-without-gouging-the-floor-drum-sander/cards/instagram/how-to-use-a-drum-sander-without-gouging-the-floor-drum-sander.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/how-to-use-a-drum-sander-without-gouging-the-floor-drum-sander/cards/instagram/how-to-use-a-drum-sander-without-gouging-the-floor-drum-sander.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/how-to-use-a-drum-sander-without-gouging-the-floor-drum-sander/cards/instagram/how-to-use-a-drum-sander-without-gouging-the-floor-drum-sander.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/how-to-use-a-drum-sander-without-gouging-the-floor-drum-sander/cards/pinterest/how-to-use-a-drum-sander-without-gouging-the-floor-drum-sander.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/how-to-use-a-drum-sander-without-gouging-the-floor-drum-sander/cards/pinterest/how-to-use-a-drum-sander-without-gouging-the-floor-drum-sander.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/how-to-use-a-drum-sander-without-gouging-the-floor-drum-sander/cards/pinterest/how-to-use-a-drum-sander-without-gouging-the-floor-drum-sander.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/how-to-use-a-drum-sander-without-gouging-the-floor-drum-sander/cards/facebook/how-to-use-a-drum-sander-without-gouging-the-floor-drum-sander.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/how-to-use-a-drum-sander-without-gouging-the-floor-drum-sander/cards/facebook/how-to-use-a-drum-sander-without-gouging-the-floor-drum-sander.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/how-to-use-a-drum-sander-without-gouging-the-floor-drum-sander/cards/facebook/how-to-use-a-drum-sander-without-gouging-the-floor-drum-sander.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>13</readingTime></item><item><title>How To Sand Detailed Trim Profiles Without Rounding Over</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 21 Nov 2025 14:57:21 +0000</pubDate><category>Trim &amp; Molding Sanding</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>dust control</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Engineer-tested methods for profile sanding detailed trim without rounding edges.

&lt;p&gt;A Saturday morning, coffee cooling on the bench, I’m staring at a stretch of 1920s casing that’s seen one too many paint jobs and a hard century of sun. The ogee still reads elegant from across the room, but up close the quirk line is softened and the fillet is barely a suggestion. I know the story because I’ve helped write versions of it: strip, sand, repaint — and somehow every pass with paper steals the edges that make the molding sing. The fear of rounding is why many pros dread profile sanding. It’s not the effort; it’s the risk of flattening crisp geometry that took a knife or cutter just seconds to define.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/25.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding/cards/instagram/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding/cards/instagram/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding/cards/instagram/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>How To Apply Grain Filler On Open Pore Woods Like Oak</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 21 Nov 2025 13:33:23 +0000</pubDate><category>Furniture Refinishing</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>orbital sander</category><description>Learn precise grain filling for oak: abrasives, sanding workflow, filler selection, and application to achieve a glass-smooth finish on open-pore woods.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="grain-filling-oak-pro-sanding-and-filler-workflow"&gt;Grain Filling Oak: Pro Sanding and Filler Workflow&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a moment every woodworker recognizes: fingertips tracing a new oak tabletop, catching on the earlywood valleys that step across the surface like tiny terraces. Under shop lights, the finish looks glossy, almost perfect—until the raking light at sunrise reveals a topography of pores telegraphing through the film. That’s when grain filling stops being a nice-to-have and becomes a requirement. On open-pore woods like oak, ash, and mahogany, achieving a piano-flat finish asks for a deliberate sequence: correct abrasive selection, controlled scratch management, filler chemistry that matches your topcoat, and disciplined leveling. Skip any step and the pores will betray your shortcuts weeks later.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/23.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling/cards/facebook/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling/cards/facebook/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling/cards/facebook/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling/cards/instagram/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling/cards/instagram/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling/cards/instagram/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling/cards/pinterest/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling/cards/pinterest/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling/cards/pinterest/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling/cards/facebook/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling/cards/facebook/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling/cards/facebook/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Recommended Grit Progression For Bare Wood Projects</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/recommended-grit-progression-for-bare-wood-projects-grit-progression/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/recommended-grit-progression-for-bare-wood-projects-grit-progression/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 21 Nov 2025 03:27:43 +0000</pubDate><category>Wood sanding</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit progression</category><category>clear coat</category><description>Learn the best grit progression for bare wood.

&lt;p&gt;The shop is quiet except for the low thrum of the dust collector warming up. A mug of coffee cools on the bench while you run your fingertips across a fresh board—straight from the planer, faint ridges under the grain. Last time, you started too fine and paid for it with stubborn tear-out lines that only became visible after stain. This time you want a better plan. You want a clear grit progression that fits the wood, the project, and the finish you’ve chosen.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/21.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/recommended-grit-progression-for-bare-wood-projects-grit-progression/cards/facebook/recommended-grit-progression-for-bare-wood-projects-grit-progression.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/recommended-grit-progression-for-bare-wood-projects-grit-progression/cards/facebook/recommended-grit-progression-for-bare-wood-projects-grit-progression.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/recommended-grit-progression-for-bare-wood-projects-grit-progression/cards/facebook/recommended-grit-progression-for-bare-wood-projects-grit-progression.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/recommended-grit-progression-for-bare-wood-projects-grit-progression/cards/instagram/recommended-grit-progression-for-bare-wood-projects-grit-progression.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/recommended-grit-progression-for-bare-wood-projects-grit-progression/cards/instagram/recommended-grit-progression-for-bare-wood-projects-grit-progression.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/recommended-grit-progression-for-bare-wood-projects-grit-progression/cards/instagram/recommended-grit-progression-for-bare-wood-projects-grit-progression.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/recommended-grit-progression-for-bare-wood-projects-grit-progression/cards/pinterest/recommended-grit-progression-for-bare-wood-projects-grit-progression.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/recommended-grit-progression-for-bare-wood-projects-grit-progression/cards/pinterest/recommended-grit-progression-for-bare-wood-projects-grit-progression.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/recommended-grit-progression-for-bare-wood-projects-grit-progression/cards/pinterest/recommended-grit-progression-for-bare-wood-projects-grit-progression.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/recommended-grit-progression-for-bare-wood-projects-grit-progression/cards/facebook/recommended-grit-progression-for-bare-wood-projects-grit-progression.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/recommended-grit-progression-for-bare-wood-projects-grit-progression/cards/facebook/recommended-grit-progression-for-bare-wood-projects-grit-progression.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/recommended-grit-progression-for-bare-wood-projects-grit-progression/cards/facebook/recommended-grit-progression-for-bare-wood-projects-grit-progression.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Grit Selection For Antifouling Paint Prep</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2025 14:20:36 +0000</pubDate><category>Marine Sanding</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-70</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-280</category><category>dust control</category><category>paint prep</category><category>orbital sander</category><description>Learn how to choose the right sanding grits for antifouling prep.

&lt;p&gt;You feel it as soon as the travel lift sets your boat on the stands: that mix of relief and responsibility. The hull looks taller on land, the waterline a faint stain of the season gone by. There’s a quiet rhythm to the boatyard in the early hours—compressors breathe, gulls trade commentary, coffee cools beside a bucket of scrapers. You run your hand over the bottom paint and feel the story of boat sanding before you even begin: the hard, glossy ridges where the sander skipped, the chalky patches that might be underbound, the thin spots the sea worked harder than you realized. It’s tempting to rush the job and get straight to brushing on antifouling. But prep is where the next season is won. Choosing the right grit is the difference between a coat that stays put and one that blisters, powders, or peels when the boat is back in her element.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/05.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding/cards/instagram/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding/cards/instagram/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding/cards/instagram/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding/cards/pinterest/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding/cards/pinterest/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding/cards/pinterest/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/grit-selection-for-antifouling-paint-prep-boat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Start Grit For Leveling High Spots</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/17/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/17/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 17 Nov 2025 15:18:37 +0000</pubDate><category>Plastic &amp; Epoxy Sanding</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-280</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><description>Learn the ideal start grit to level epoxy high spots, avoid clogging, and build a clean sanding workflow for flat, finish-ready surfaces.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="epoxy-sanding-best-start-grit-for-high-spots"&gt;Epoxy sanding: best start grit for high spots&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first pass tells the whole story. You stand over a curing project—maybe a kayak hull, a countertop, or a floor section—with yesterday’s resin gone glassy and a few unkind ridges catching the raking light. Your hand slides across the surface and pauses on a drip, a seam, a ripple that won’t disappear by wishful thinking. You can hear the random orbital sander on the bench before you touch it. The only decision that matters now: what grit to start with. Get it wrong and you burn time, discs, and patience. Get it right and the surface flatness comes quickly, scratches stack predictably, and the finish you planned is still in reach. I’ve spent years chasing that first cut—especially during epoxy sanding—because the first cut sets your entire workflow’s cost, heat load, and scratch management.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/28.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/17/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/17/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/17/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/17/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding/cards/instagram/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/17/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding/cards/instagram/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/17/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding/cards/instagram/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/17/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding/cards/pinterest/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/17/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding/cards/pinterest/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/17/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding/cards/pinterest/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/17/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/17/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/17/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Reduced Heat And Loading On Tough Materials</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/16/reduced-heat-and-loading-on-tough-materials-ceramic-sanding-discs/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/16/reduced-heat-and-loading-on-tough-materials-ceramic-sanding-discs/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 16 Nov 2025 13:30:01 +0000</pubDate><category>Ceramic &amp; Premium Abrasives</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-180</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>Engineer-tested review of ceramic sanding discs—how they cut cooler, resist loading, and last longer on stainless, hardwoods, and composites.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="ceramic-sanding-discs-for-cooler-cleaner-cuts"&gt;Ceramic Sanding Discs for Cooler, Cleaner Cuts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Late on a Saturday, the garage hums like a small factory. The goal is modest—deburr a few stainless brackets, flatten a maple cutting board, and knock down drips on a fiberglass canoe repair—but the reality is a stack of spent discs, a hot sander, and surfaces that look worse with every pass. You can smell scorched wood and feel the sander dragging as the face clogs with resin and dust. The disc you just installed is already glazed. It’s the kind of session that makes you wonder if sanding is a test of patience rather than a controllable, measurable process.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/22.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/16/reduced-heat-and-loading-on-tough-materials-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/reduced-heat-and-loading-on-tough-materials-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/16/reduced-heat-and-loading-on-tough-materials-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/reduced-heat-and-loading-on-tough-materials-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/16/reduced-heat-and-loading-on-tough-materials-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/reduced-heat-and-loading-on-tough-materials-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/16/reduced-heat-and-loading-on-tough-materials-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/reduced-heat-and-loading-on-tough-materials-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/16/reduced-heat-and-loading-on-tough-materials-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/reduced-heat-and-loading-on-tough-materials-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/16/reduced-heat-and-loading-on-tough-materials-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/reduced-heat-and-loading-on-tough-materials-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/16/reduced-heat-and-loading-on-tough-materials-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/reduced-heat-and-loading-on-tough-materials-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/16/reduced-heat-and-loading-on-tough-materials-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/reduced-heat-and-loading-on-tough-materials-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/16/reduced-heat-and-loading-on-tough-materials-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/reduced-heat-and-loading-on-tough-materials-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/16/reduced-heat-and-loading-on-tough-materials-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/reduced-heat-and-loading-on-tough-materials-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/16/reduced-heat-and-loading-on-tough-materials-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/reduced-heat-and-loading-on-tough-materials-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/16/reduced-heat-and-loading-on-tough-materials-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/reduced-heat-and-loading-on-tough-materials-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Step Down Rules To Erase Deep Scratches</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 15 Nov 2025 16:51:30 +0000</pubDate><category>Grit Range &amp; Classification</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><description>Pro techniques for stepping down sandpaper grit to erase deep scratches on wood, metal, and plastic with precise workflows and abrasive selection.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="mastering-sandpaper-grit-for-deep-scratch-removal"&gt;Mastering sandpaper grit for deep scratch removal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first pass felt promising. Under the raking light, your tabletop—once scored by a moving box staple—looked flatter after a few steady minutes with the sander. But as you wipe the dust and the surface flashes under a shop lamp, new lines appear, marching in a tidy, parallel pattern. You didn’t make the damage worse; you simply revealed the truth. Deep scratches are not single defects; they’re profiles with depth, flanks, and torn fibers or gouged metal. Managing that geometry is why sandpaper grit selection and step-down discipline matter as much as the tool in hand.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/20.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit/cards/instagram/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit/cards/instagram/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit/cards/instagram/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit/cards/pinterest/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit/cards/pinterest/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit/cards/pinterest/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>When You Can Skip Intermediate Grits</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/when-you-can-skip-intermediate-grits-sandpaper-grit-chart/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/when-you-can-skip-intermediate-grits-sandpaper-grit-chart/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 15 Nov 2025 15:50:19 +0000</pubDate><category>Grit Guide &amp; Education</category><category>grit chart</category><category>abrasive standards</category><category>grit progression</category><category>grit-40</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-101</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><description>Learn when to skip intermediate grits and use a sandpaper grit chart for faster, flawless finishes on wood, paint, and metal.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="when-you-can-skip-grits-a-sandpaper-grit-chart-guide"&gt;When You Can Skip Grits: A Sandpaper Grit Chart Guide&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ve cleared a corner of the garage, moved the bikes just enough to set out sawhorses, and wrestled a wobbly dresser onto the stands. It’s late, your playlist is humming, and there’s a small mountain of sanding discs beside you—80, 100, 120, 150, 180, 220, 320. You glance at the packaging diagram, then pull up a sandpaper grit chart on your phone, wondering if you really have to touch every single step. You’re not restoring a museum piece; you just want this dresser to look clean and feel smooth before paint. How many passes will it take? How many hours?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/18.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/when-you-can-skip-intermediate-grits-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/when-you-can-skip-intermediate-grits-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/when-you-can-skip-intermediate-grits-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/when-you-can-skip-intermediate-grits-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/when-you-can-skip-intermediate-grits-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/when-you-can-skip-intermediate-grits-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/when-you-can-skip-intermediate-grits-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/instagram/when-you-can-skip-intermediate-grits-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/when-you-can-skip-intermediate-grits-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/instagram/when-you-can-skip-intermediate-grits-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/when-you-can-skip-intermediate-grits-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/instagram/when-you-can-skip-intermediate-grits-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/when-you-can-skip-intermediate-grits-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/pinterest/when-you-can-skip-intermediate-grits-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/when-you-can-skip-intermediate-grits-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/pinterest/when-you-can-skip-intermediate-grits-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/when-you-can-skip-intermediate-grits-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/pinterest/when-you-can-skip-intermediate-grits-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/when-you-can-skip-intermediate-grits-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/when-you-can-skip-intermediate-grits-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/when-you-can-skip-intermediate-grits-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/when-you-can-skip-intermediate-grits-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/when-you-can-skip-intermediate-grits-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/when-you-can-skip-intermediate-grits-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Multi Hole Discs Improve Airflow And Cut</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/multi-hole-discs-improve-airflow-and-cut-dustless-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/multi-hole-discs-improve-airflow-and-cut-dustless-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 15 Nov 2025 14:04:48 +0000</pubDate><category>Dust Extraction Systems</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-180</category><category>joint compound</category><category>orbital sander</category><description>Learn how multi-hole discs boost airflow, cut rate, and surface finish while keeping dustless sanding clean and precise in wood, auto, and drywall jobs.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="dustless-sanding-multi-hole-discs-that-cut-faster"&gt;Dustless sanding: multi-hole discs that cut faster&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a Saturday morning in the shop, the light comes in as a hazy beam. You flip on the sander, nudge it onto an oak tabletop, and within seconds the air looks like a snow globe gone rogue. Your safety glasses fog, your shirt turns gray, and the shop vac whines like it’s doing something—but the dust still settles on every flat surface you own. I’ve been there. I’ve also watched the other version of this scene: the pad spins, dust disappears, the workpiece stays cool, and the abrasive keeps biting for pass after pass. The difference isn’t magic—it&amp;rsquo;s airflow. Specifically, the way a multi-hole disc and a properly set vacuum system handle air and debris to deliver real dustless sanding without killing your cut rate.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/16.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/multi-hole-discs-improve-airflow-and-cut-dustless-sanding/cards/facebook/multi-hole-discs-improve-airflow-and-cut-dustless-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/multi-hole-discs-improve-airflow-and-cut-dustless-sanding/cards/facebook/multi-hole-discs-improve-airflow-and-cut-dustless-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/multi-hole-discs-improve-airflow-and-cut-dustless-sanding/cards/facebook/multi-hole-discs-improve-airflow-and-cut-dustless-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/multi-hole-discs-improve-airflow-and-cut-dustless-sanding/cards/instagram/multi-hole-discs-improve-airflow-and-cut-dustless-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/multi-hole-discs-improve-airflow-and-cut-dustless-sanding/cards/instagram/multi-hole-discs-improve-airflow-and-cut-dustless-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/multi-hole-discs-improve-airflow-and-cut-dustless-sanding/cards/instagram/multi-hole-discs-improve-airflow-and-cut-dustless-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/multi-hole-discs-improve-airflow-and-cut-dustless-sanding/cards/pinterest/multi-hole-discs-improve-airflow-and-cut-dustless-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/multi-hole-discs-improve-airflow-and-cut-dustless-sanding/cards/pinterest/multi-hole-discs-improve-airflow-and-cut-dustless-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/multi-hole-discs-improve-airflow-and-cut-dustless-sanding/cards/pinterest/multi-hole-discs-improve-airflow-and-cut-dustless-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/multi-hole-discs-improve-airflow-and-cut-dustless-sanding/cards/facebook/multi-hole-discs-improve-airflow-and-cut-dustless-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/multi-hole-discs-improve-airflow-and-cut-dustless-sanding/cards/facebook/multi-hole-discs-improve-airflow-and-cut-dustless-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/multi-hole-discs-improve-airflow-and-cut-dustless-sanding/cards/facebook/multi-hole-discs-improve-airflow-and-cut-dustless-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Avoid Burn Marks With Belt Sanders</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 14 Nov 2025 13:35:38 +0000</pubDate><category>Sanding Belts &amp; Machines</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-240</category><description>Stop burn marks with belt sanders.

&lt;p&gt;You smell it before you see it—the faint sweet, acrid note that means heat has been winning. The shop is quiet except for the belt sander’s steady hum, dust hanging in the light like early fog. You’re two boards into a Saturday batch of maple shelves, and there it is: a brown kiss on the edge, curved perfectly to match your contact drum. It’s the same mark that has sent too many good pieces to the scrap bin. You lighten your touch, bump the feed, try another pass. The scorch grows one shade darker. If you’ve stood at a belt sander—handheld, benchtop, or wide-belt—you’ve had this moment. It’s not a lack of care. It’s heat, friction, and time teaming up faster than you can move.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/08.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts/cards/instagram/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts/cards/instagram/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts/cards/instagram/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts/cards/pinterest/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts/cards/pinterest/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts/cards/pinterest/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Choose Cork Or Rubber Blocks For Even Pressure</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 16:32:32 +0000</pubDate><category>Sanding Blocks</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>sanding block</category><description>Decide between cork and rubber sanding block for even pressure.

&lt;p&gt;You feel it before you see it: the drag of abrasive across primer, the subtle chatter in your wrist, the way dust plumes differently at the edge than it does in the center. The project might be a cabinet door with raised panels, an automotive quarter panel wearing its first coat of high-build, or a mid-century tabletop with a veneer you refuse to risk. Regardless of the substrate, the instrument in your hand—a sanding block—is the difference between flat and faceted, between crisp and crowned. When the pressure is wrong, the finish is wrong. The telltale symptoms appear later: telegraphed low spots under gloss, rounded edges where a sharp reveal should live, swirl hazing that refuses to die at the next grit.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/04.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/cards/facebook/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/cards/facebook/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/cards/facebook/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/cards/instagram/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/cards/instagram/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/cards/instagram/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/cards/facebook/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/cards/facebook/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/cards/facebook/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>13</readingTime></item><item><title>Scratch Pattern Control For Metal Panels Before Primer</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2025 15:09:37 +0000</pubDate><category>Metal Polishing &amp; Rust Repair</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><description>Learn expert scratch pattern control for metal panels before primer with step-by-step sanding, tool choices, and troubleshooting from a pro workshop</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="metal-surface-sanding-scratch-control-before-primer"&gt;Metal Surface Sanding: Scratch Control Before Primer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The evening a panel is finally quiet is when the real work begins. You kill the grinder, and suddenly it’s just you, a breath of solvent in the air, and sheet metal that shows everything—every ding mapped by light, every shallow wave you swore wasn’t there in the morning. I’ve been there with a door skin laid across sawhorses, work lamp low and unforgiving, palm testing the temperature of steel that still remembers the sander. This moment decides whether primer becomes a friend that hides your sins or a megaphone that announces every missed step.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/21.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding/cards/facebook/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding/cards/facebook/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding/cards/facebook/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding/cards/instagram/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding/cards/instagram/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding/cards/instagram/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding/cards/pinterest/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding/cards/pinterest/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding/cards/pinterest/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding/cards/facebook/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding/cards/facebook/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding/cards/facebook/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Best Grit To Sand Epoxy Primer Before Filler Or Sealer</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/best-grit-to-sand-epoxy-primer-before-filler-or-sealer-primer-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/best-grit-to-sand-epoxy-primer-before-filler-or-sealer-primer-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2025 05:25:06 +0000</pubDate><category>Auto Body Sanding</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-200</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><description>Learn the best grit to sand epoxy primer before filler or sealer, with pro techniques, workflows, and troubleshooting for a paint-ready surface.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="primer-sanding-grits-for-epoxy-before-filler-or-sealer"&gt;Primer Sanding Grits for Epoxy Before Filler or Sealer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning, the garage door yawns open and the light falls across your project—maybe it’s the fender you’ve wrestled straight after months of small fixes, or a truck hood you promised yourself you’d finish before the weather turns. The radio is low, the coffee is cooling, and the bench is lined with sandpaper packs in every color and number. You know this stage matters: what you do next determines whether your basecoat glides on like glass or telegraphs every ripple, pinhole, and scratch. But there’s a nagging question poised at the edge of the workbench. What grit is right for epoxy right now? Is 80 too coarse, 320 too fine? Where does sealer fit? That’s the difference between a finish you’re proud to show and one you’ll forever see in harsh afternoon light.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/15.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/best-grit-to-sand-epoxy-primer-before-filler-or-sealer-primer-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-to-sand-epoxy-primer-before-filler-or-sealer-primer-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/best-grit-to-sand-epoxy-primer-before-filler-or-sealer-primer-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-to-sand-epoxy-primer-before-filler-or-sealer-primer-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/best-grit-to-sand-epoxy-primer-before-filler-or-sealer-primer-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-to-sand-epoxy-primer-before-filler-or-sealer-primer-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/best-grit-to-sand-epoxy-primer-before-filler-or-sealer-primer-sanding/cards/instagram/best-grit-to-sand-epoxy-primer-before-filler-or-sealer-primer-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/best-grit-to-sand-epoxy-primer-before-filler-or-sealer-primer-sanding/cards/instagram/best-grit-to-sand-epoxy-primer-before-filler-or-sealer-primer-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/best-grit-to-sand-epoxy-primer-before-filler-or-sealer-primer-sanding/cards/instagram/best-grit-to-sand-epoxy-primer-before-filler-or-sealer-primer-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/best-grit-to-sand-epoxy-primer-before-filler-or-sealer-primer-sanding/cards/pinterest/best-grit-to-sand-epoxy-primer-before-filler-or-sealer-primer-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/best-grit-to-sand-epoxy-primer-before-filler-or-sealer-primer-sanding/cards/pinterest/best-grit-to-sand-epoxy-primer-before-filler-or-sealer-primer-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/best-grit-to-sand-epoxy-primer-before-filler-or-sealer-primer-sanding/cards/pinterest/best-grit-to-sand-epoxy-primer-before-filler-or-sealer-primer-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/best-grit-to-sand-epoxy-primer-before-filler-or-sealer-primer-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-to-sand-epoxy-primer-before-filler-or-sealer-primer-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/best-grit-to-sand-epoxy-primer-before-filler-or-sealer-primer-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-to-sand-epoxy-primer-before-filler-or-sealer-primer-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/best-grit-to-sand-epoxy-primer-before-filler-or-sealer-primer-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-to-sand-epoxy-primer-before-filler-or-sealer-primer-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Moisture And Acclimation Checks Before Floor Sanding</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/moisture-and-acclimation-checks-before-floor-sanding-wood-floor-prep/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/moisture-and-acclimation-checks-before-floor-sanding-wood-floor-prep/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2025 21:54:27 +0000</pubDate><category>Floor &amp; Deck Sanding</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-220</category><category>dry sanding</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Moisture and acclimation checks for wood floor prep.

&lt;p&gt;The first time I heard a moisture meter beep in an empty living room, I knew my weekend “quick sand and coat” wasn’t going to be quick at all. Sunlight was warming the boards by the patio door, the HVAC was off to save a few bucks, and the floor felt flat. But wood doesn’t ask how it feels—it tells you through movement. That morning, I leaned on the handle of my drum sander and thought about the real beginning of any wood floor prep: knowing where the moisture sits, where it’s heading, and whether the room’s climate matches the life the floor will live after you’re done. If you’ve ever watched stain turn blotchy, or a new finish develop white lines at board edges, you’ve met moisture the hard way.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/13.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/moisture-and-acclimation-checks-before-floor-sanding-wood-floor-prep/cards/facebook/moisture-and-acclimation-checks-before-floor-sanding-wood-floor-prep.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/moisture-and-acclimation-checks-before-floor-sanding-wood-floor-prep/cards/facebook/moisture-and-acclimation-checks-before-floor-sanding-wood-floor-prep.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/moisture-and-acclimation-checks-before-floor-sanding-wood-floor-prep/cards/facebook/moisture-and-acclimation-checks-before-floor-sanding-wood-floor-prep.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/moisture-and-acclimation-checks-before-floor-sanding-wood-floor-prep/cards/instagram/moisture-and-acclimation-checks-before-floor-sanding-wood-floor-prep.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/moisture-and-acclimation-checks-before-floor-sanding-wood-floor-prep/cards/instagram/moisture-and-acclimation-checks-before-floor-sanding-wood-floor-prep.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/moisture-and-acclimation-checks-before-floor-sanding-wood-floor-prep/cards/instagram/moisture-and-acclimation-checks-before-floor-sanding-wood-floor-prep.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/moisture-and-acclimation-checks-before-floor-sanding-wood-floor-prep/cards/pinterest/moisture-and-acclimation-checks-before-floor-sanding-wood-floor-prep.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/moisture-and-acclimation-checks-before-floor-sanding-wood-floor-prep/cards/pinterest/moisture-and-acclimation-checks-before-floor-sanding-wood-floor-prep.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/moisture-and-acclimation-checks-before-floor-sanding-wood-floor-prep/cards/pinterest/moisture-and-acclimation-checks-before-floor-sanding-wood-floor-prep.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/moisture-and-acclimation-checks-before-floor-sanding-wood-floor-prep/cards/facebook/moisture-and-acclimation-checks-before-floor-sanding-wood-floor-prep.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/moisture-and-acclimation-checks-before-floor-sanding-wood-floor-prep/cards/facebook/moisture-and-acclimation-checks-before-floor-sanding-wood-floor-prep.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/moisture-and-acclimation-checks-before-floor-sanding-wood-floor-prep/cards/facebook/moisture-and-acclimation-checks-before-floor-sanding-wood-floor-prep.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>How To Level Uneven Wood Panels By Sanding Only</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-level-uneven-wood-panels-by-sanding-only-surface-leveling/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-level-uneven-wood-panels-by-sanding-only-surface-leveling/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2025 14:29:42 +0000</pubDate><category>Wood sanding</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-500</category><category>sanding block</category><category>dust control</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Learn pro sanding techniques for surface leveling.

&lt;p&gt;On a cool Saturday morning, your glue-up looks perfect from three paces away. The seams are tight, the grain lines match, and you’re already picturing the finish. Then the raking light hits—tiny ridges, a clamp bump here, a cup there. You run a straightedge across and hear that hollow tick in the middle. No planer, no drum sander, and only the shop basics on your bench. This is where the craft begins, not where it ends. With deliberate handwork, smart tool choice, and disciplined grit progression, you can achieve precise surface leveling using sanding alone. The key is to treat the panel like a system: track where the highs are, remove stock only where you must, and lock in flatness before you chase scratches. If your project is an heirloom tabletop or a cabinet door set, your workflow doesn’t change much—what changes is your patience and how clearly you can “see” the surface as you sand. I’ll show you my repeatable process for flattening panels by hand, with nothing more than sandpaper, a few blocks, and a healthy respect for dust control and measurement. You’ll learn to read the wood, choose the right grit sequences, and avoid common traps like rolling edges or leaving a subtle dish that ruins your finish. This is hands-on, no-nonsense surface leveling tailored for real shops and real projects.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-level-uneven-wood-panels-by-sanding-only-surface-leveling/cards/facebook/how-to-level-uneven-wood-panels-by-sanding-only-surface-leveling.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-level-uneven-wood-panels-by-sanding-only-surface-leveling/cards/facebook/how-to-level-uneven-wood-panels-by-sanding-only-surface-leveling.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-level-uneven-wood-panels-by-sanding-only-surface-leveling/cards/facebook/how-to-level-uneven-wood-panels-by-sanding-only-surface-leveling.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-level-uneven-wood-panels-by-sanding-only-surface-leveling/cards/instagram/how-to-level-uneven-wood-panels-by-sanding-only-surface-leveling.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-level-uneven-wood-panels-by-sanding-only-surface-leveling/cards/instagram/how-to-level-uneven-wood-panels-by-sanding-only-surface-leveling.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-level-uneven-wood-panels-by-sanding-only-surface-leveling/cards/instagram/how-to-level-uneven-wood-panels-by-sanding-only-surface-leveling.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-level-uneven-wood-panels-by-sanding-only-surface-leveling/cards/pinterest/how-to-level-uneven-wood-panels-by-sanding-only-surface-leveling.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-level-uneven-wood-panels-by-sanding-only-surface-leveling/cards/pinterest/how-to-level-uneven-wood-panels-by-sanding-only-surface-leveling.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-level-uneven-wood-panels-by-sanding-only-surface-leveling/cards/pinterest/how-to-level-uneven-wood-panels-by-sanding-only-surface-leveling.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-level-uneven-wood-panels-by-sanding-only-surface-leveling/cards/facebook/how-to-level-uneven-wood-panels-by-sanding-only-surface-leveling.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-level-uneven-wood-panels-by-sanding-only-surface-leveling/cards/facebook/how-to-level-uneven-wood-panels-by-sanding-only-surface-leveling.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-level-uneven-wood-panels-by-sanding-only-surface-leveling/cards/facebook/how-to-level-uneven-wood-panels-by-sanding-only-surface-leveling.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>9</readingTime></item><item><title>Choose Sanding Direction To Follow The Grain</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/09/choose-sanding-direction-to-follow-the-grain-hand-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/09/choose-sanding-direction-to-follow-the-grain-hand-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 09 Nov 2025 18:57:00 +0000</pubDate><category>Hand Sanding Techniques</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-500</category><description>Learn how to choose sanding direction, optimize abrasive performance, and master hand sanding workflows for flawless, grain-aligned wood surfaces.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="hand-sanding-with-the-grain-direction-that-wins"&gt;Hand Sanding With the Grain: Direction That Wins&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first pass across the old walnut dresser felt almost sacrilegious. Early light from the shop window caught the cathedral patterns in the veneer and made the scratches I’d inherited glow silver against the warm brown. Years of hasty refinishes had left low, cross-grain swirls that refused to disappear under fresh film. I set the random-orbit sander aside, reached for a cork block, and let the board tell me where it wanted me to go. In that moment, hand sanding was not about nostalgia—it was about control. Fingers learned the flow of the fibers, eyes trained on the raking light, strokes tracking the grain like a compass needle finally finding north.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/09/choose-sanding-direction-to-follow-the-grain-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/choose-sanding-direction-to-follow-the-grain-hand-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/09/choose-sanding-direction-to-follow-the-grain-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/choose-sanding-direction-to-follow-the-grain-hand-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/09/choose-sanding-direction-to-follow-the-grain-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/choose-sanding-direction-to-follow-the-grain-hand-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/09/choose-sanding-direction-to-follow-the-grain-hand-sanding/cards/instagram/choose-sanding-direction-to-follow-the-grain-hand-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/09/choose-sanding-direction-to-follow-the-grain-hand-sanding/cards/instagram/choose-sanding-direction-to-follow-the-grain-hand-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/09/choose-sanding-direction-to-follow-the-grain-hand-sanding/cards/instagram/choose-sanding-direction-to-follow-the-grain-hand-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/09/choose-sanding-direction-to-follow-the-grain-hand-sanding/cards/pinterest/choose-sanding-direction-to-follow-the-grain-hand-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/09/choose-sanding-direction-to-follow-the-grain-hand-sanding/cards/pinterest/choose-sanding-direction-to-follow-the-grain-hand-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/09/choose-sanding-direction-to-follow-the-grain-hand-sanding/cards/pinterest/choose-sanding-direction-to-follow-the-grain-hand-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/09/choose-sanding-direction-to-follow-the-grain-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/choose-sanding-direction-to-follow-the-grain-hand-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/09/choose-sanding-direction-to-follow-the-grain-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/choose-sanding-direction-to-follow-the-grain-hand-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/09/choose-sanding-direction-to-follow-the-grain-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/choose-sanding-direction-to-follow-the-grain-hand-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Consistency Of Scratch Pattern By Brand</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/consistency-of-scratch-pattern-by-brand-best-sandpaper-brand/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/consistency-of-scratch-pattern-by-brand-best-sandpaper-brand/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 08 Nov 2025 16:24:24 +0000</pubDate><category>Brand &amp; Quality Comparison</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-400</category><category>clear coat</category><category>dust control</category><description>Get uniform finishes.

&lt;p&gt;Saturday mornings in the shop have a rhythm: kettle on, dust extractor humming, the first pass of the sander checking if the week’s idea holds water. I still remember one particular maple tabletop that had me pacing. It looked flat, felt flat, yet stain kept telegraphing faint halos and random cat-scratch lines. I’d done everything “right,” but the finish wouldn’t sing. That’s when a friend dropped by and asked a deceptively simple question: “Do you trust the scratch pattern your paper leaves?” Since then, I’ve made a small obsession of it—because picking the best sandpaper brand isn’t just about how fast it cuts; it’s about how consistently it scratches, grit after grit, sheet after sheet.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/consistency-of-scratch-pattern-by-brand-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/facebook/consistency-of-scratch-pattern-by-brand-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/consistency-of-scratch-pattern-by-brand-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/facebook/consistency-of-scratch-pattern-by-brand-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/consistency-of-scratch-pattern-by-brand-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/facebook/consistency-of-scratch-pattern-by-brand-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/consistency-of-scratch-pattern-by-brand-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/instagram/consistency-of-scratch-pattern-by-brand-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/consistency-of-scratch-pattern-by-brand-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/instagram/consistency-of-scratch-pattern-by-brand-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/consistency-of-scratch-pattern-by-brand-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/instagram/consistency-of-scratch-pattern-by-brand-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/consistency-of-scratch-pattern-by-brand-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/pinterest/consistency-of-scratch-pattern-by-brand-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/consistency-of-scratch-pattern-by-brand-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/pinterest/consistency-of-scratch-pattern-by-brand-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/consistency-of-scratch-pattern-by-brand-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/pinterest/consistency-of-scratch-pattern-by-brand-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/consistency-of-scratch-pattern-by-brand-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/facebook/consistency-of-scratch-pattern-by-brand-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/consistency-of-scratch-pattern-by-brand-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/facebook/consistency-of-scratch-pattern-by-brand-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/consistency-of-scratch-pattern-by-brand-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/facebook/consistency-of-scratch-pattern-by-brand-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>When To Choose Ceramic Over Sic</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 08 Nov 2025 02:26:28 +0000</pubDate><category>Abrasive Materials &amp; Compounds</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><description>Learn when ceramic abrasives outperform silicon carbide sandpaper for metals, composites, and coatings, with actionable workflows and pro surface-prep tips.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="choosing-ceramic-vs-silicon-carbide-sandpaper"&gt;Choosing Ceramic vs Silicon Carbide Sandpaper&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can hear it before you see it: the sander spins up, the deck light pools across a panel, and the first passes scratch a story into the surface. On a chilly Saturday morning, I’m in a small body shop with two stacks on the cart—one ceramic-oxide disc set, one pile of silicon carbide sandpaper sheets. The job is a split personality: strip rust from a welded bracket, level high-build primer on a fender, then color-sand a fresh clear coat. The wrong abrasive wastes time and ruins finish; the right abrasive turns minutes into clean geometry and predictable gloss. And the smartest choice changes as the substrate, coating, and workflow change.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/instagram/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/instagram/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/instagram/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Task Matching By Grit Range</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/task-matching-by-grit-range-sandpaper-grit/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/task-matching-by-grit-range-sandpaper-grit/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 06 Nov 2025 16:30:50 +0000</pubDate><category>Grit Range &amp; Classification</category><category>grit-40</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-101</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><description>Learn how to match tasks to sandpaper grit for wood, metal, and paint.

&lt;p&gt;The project usually begins with confidence: a sunny Saturday, a coffee within reach, and a table or bike part you’re finally ready to refresh. You pull out the sander, grab whatever sandpaper is on top, and get to work. Ten minutes later, the surface looks worse—deep scratches in one spot, shiny untouched coatings in another, and dust everywhere. It’s a moment most DIYers and even pros have felt: the work is happening, but progress isn’t. The missing piece is rarely effort. It’s almost always selection—specifically, matching the task to the right sandpaper grit.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/task-matching-by-grit-range-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/task-matching-by-grit-range-sandpaper-grit.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/task-matching-by-grit-range-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/task-matching-by-grit-range-sandpaper-grit.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/task-matching-by-grit-range-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/task-matching-by-grit-range-sandpaper-grit.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/task-matching-by-grit-range-sandpaper-grit/cards/instagram/task-matching-by-grit-range-sandpaper-grit.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/task-matching-by-grit-range-sandpaper-grit/cards/instagram/task-matching-by-grit-range-sandpaper-grit.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/task-matching-by-grit-range-sandpaper-grit/cards/instagram/task-matching-by-grit-range-sandpaper-grit.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/task-matching-by-grit-range-sandpaper-grit/cards/pinterest/task-matching-by-grit-range-sandpaper-grit.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/task-matching-by-grit-range-sandpaper-grit/cards/pinterest/task-matching-by-grit-range-sandpaper-grit.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/task-matching-by-grit-range-sandpaper-grit/cards/pinterest/task-matching-by-grit-range-sandpaper-grit.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/task-matching-by-grit-range-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/task-matching-by-grit-range-sandpaper-grit.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/task-matching-by-grit-range-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/task-matching-by-grit-range-sandpaper-grit.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/task-matching-by-grit-range-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/task-matching-by-grit-range-sandpaper-grit.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>How To Choose A Starting Grit</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/how-to-choose-a-starting-grit-sandpaper-grit-chart/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/how-to-choose-a-starting-grit-sandpaper-grit-chart/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 06 Nov 2025 15:25:52 +0000</pubDate><category>Grit Guide &amp; Education</category><category>grit chart</category><category>abrasive standards</category><category>grit progression</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-101</category><category>grit-120</category><category>clear coat</category><category>orbital sander</category><description>Learn how to choose your starting grit with a clear sandpaper grit chart, shop-tested sequences, and pro tips for clean, fast, and flat sanding.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="sandpaper-grit-chart-choose-the-right-starting-grit"&gt;Sandpaper Grit Chart: Choose the Right Starting Grit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first time I watched a flawless finish come alive, it happened in the last ten minutes of a long Saturday in the shop. Cold radio in the background, dust collector humming, I wiped a splash of mineral spirits across a dining tabletop and the grain popped like a film reveal. That moment didn’t come from luck—it came from choosing the right starting grit. I keep a small sandpaper grit chart taped to my cabinet door, not because I can’t memorize grits, but because the surface in front of you changes the rules. A hundred-year-old oak stained dark is not the same as new maple fresh off the planer. Paint sprayed last month is not like six coats of hand-brushed oil from the 90s. The trick is reading the job, then picking the grit that does the heavy lifting without making more work.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/how-to-choose-a-starting-grit-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/how-to-choose-a-starting-grit-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/how-to-choose-a-starting-grit-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/how-to-choose-a-starting-grit-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/how-to-choose-a-starting-grit-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/how-to-choose-a-starting-grit-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/how-to-choose-a-starting-grit-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/instagram/how-to-choose-a-starting-grit-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/how-to-choose-a-starting-grit-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/instagram/how-to-choose-a-starting-grit-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/how-to-choose-a-starting-grit-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/instagram/how-to-choose-a-starting-grit-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/how-to-choose-a-starting-grit-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/pinterest/how-to-choose-a-starting-grit-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/how-to-choose-a-starting-grit-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/pinterest/how-to-choose-a-starting-grit-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/how-to-choose-a-starting-grit-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/pinterest/how-to-choose-a-starting-grit-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/how-to-choose-a-starting-grit-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/how-to-choose-a-starting-grit-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/how-to-choose-a-starting-grit-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/how-to-choose-a-starting-grit-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/how-to-choose-a-starting-grit-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/how-to-choose-a-starting-grit-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Choose Hose Diameter For Best Suction</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 06 Nov 2025 14:24:00 +0000</pubDate><category>Dust Extraction Systems</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>dry sanding</category><category>orbital sander</category><category>sanding block</category><category>joint compound</category><description>An engineer’s guide to hose diameter for dustless sanding—get the best suction, cleaner air, and faster finishing with data-driven choices.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="dustless-sanding-pick-the-right-hose-diameter"&gt;Dustless Sanding: Pick the Right Hose Diameter&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first time I tried to sand a maple tabletop in my small garage, I didn’t plan for the dust. Within minutes, a visible cloud hovered over my workbench, the air had that chalky taste, and the light from the door turned into a foggy beam. The sander did its job, but the shop felt uninhabitable. Fast-forward to today, and my setup looks completely different: a quiet extractor hums under the bench, a smooth-bore hose clips into a sander with a snug port connection, and the cleanup is mostly emptying a bag. The shift to dustless sanding wasn’t just about comfort—it was about control. Once you understand how hose diameter, hose length, and vacuum performance interact, you can tune a system that captures chips and submicron dust instead of aerosolizing it.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding/cards/facebook/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding/cards/facebook/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding/cards/facebook/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding/cards/instagram/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding/cards/instagram/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding/cards/instagram/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding/cards/pinterest/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding/cards/pinterest/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding/cards/pinterest/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding/cards/facebook/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding/cards/facebook/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding/cards/facebook/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Reduce Swirls By Pairing Pad And Grit Correctly</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/reduce-swirls-by-pairing-pad-and-grit-correctly-sander-interface-pad/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/reduce-swirls-by-pairing-pad-and-grit-correctly-sander-interface-pad/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 06 Nov 2025 13:34:29 +0000</pubDate><category>Interface Pads &amp; Backing Pads</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><description>Learn how pairing a sander interface pad with the right grits reduces swirls, improves cut control, and optimizes dust extraction for flawless finishes.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="mastering-the-sander-interface-pad-to-erase-swirls"&gt;Mastering the sander interface pad to erase swirls&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It always shows up under raking light. You sweep your flashlight across a freshly primed cabinet door or a leveled epoxy table top, and there it is—faint haloing, tight hook-shaped pigtails, and a dull gray cast that just shouldn’t be there. You did the steps. You stepped up the grits. You vacuumed between passes. But the surface still whispers “machine marks.” The moment feels familiar to anyone chasing a clean finish on wood, primer, or clear coat. The fix isn’t more pressure, more passes, or a magic abrasive. It’s control—control of contact pressure, compliance, and cut geometry. And that’s exactly what a sander interface pad delivers when paired correctly with grit and machine settings.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/reduce-swirls-by-pairing-pad-and-grit-correctly-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/reduce-swirls-by-pairing-pad-and-grit-correctly-sander-interface-pad.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/reduce-swirls-by-pairing-pad-and-grit-correctly-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/reduce-swirls-by-pairing-pad-and-grit-correctly-sander-interface-pad.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/reduce-swirls-by-pairing-pad-and-grit-correctly-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/reduce-swirls-by-pairing-pad-and-grit-correctly-sander-interface-pad.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/reduce-swirls-by-pairing-pad-and-grit-correctly-sander-interface-pad/cards/instagram/reduce-swirls-by-pairing-pad-and-grit-correctly-sander-interface-pad.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/reduce-swirls-by-pairing-pad-and-grit-correctly-sander-interface-pad/cards/instagram/reduce-swirls-by-pairing-pad-and-grit-correctly-sander-interface-pad.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/reduce-swirls-by-pairing-pad-and-grit-correctly-sander-interface-pad/cards/instagram/reduce-swirls-by-pairing-pad-and-grit-correctly-sander-interface-pad.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/reduce-swirls-by-pairing-pad-and-grit-correctly-sander-interface-pad/cards/pinterest/reduce-swirls-by-pairing-pad-and-grit-correctly-sander-interface-pad.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/reduce-swirls-by-pairing-pad-and-grit-correctly-sander-interface-pad/cards/pinterest/reduce-swirls-by-pairing-pad-and-grit-correctly-sander-interface-pad.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/reduce-swirls-by-pairing-pad-and-grit-correctly-sander-interface-pad/cards/pinterest/reduce-swirls-by-pairing-pad-and-grit-correctly-sander-interface-pad.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/reduce-swirls-by-pairing-pad-and-grit-correctly-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/reduce-swirls-by-pairing-pad-and-grit-correctly-sander-interface-pad.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/reduce-swirls-by-pairing-pad-and-grit-correctly-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/reduce-swirls-by-pairing-pad-and-grit-correctly-sander-interface-pad.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/reduce-swirls-by-pairing-pad-and-grit-correctly-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/reduce-swirls-by-pairing-pad-and-grit-correctly-sander-interface-pad.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Psa Versus Hook And Loop Sanding Use Cases</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/psa-versus-hook-and-loop-sanding-use-cases-psa-sanding-discs/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/psa-versus-hook-and-loop-sanding-use-cases-psa-sanding-discs/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 06 Nov 2025 00:31:33 +0000</pubDate><category>PSA Discs</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-220</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>Compare PSA vs hook and loop sanding discs to choose the right system.

&lt;p&gt;Saturday light spills across your bench. The coffee’s gone cool, but your focus is warm and steady. You’re halfway through a maple tabletop—the kind of project where each pass of the sander either reveals depth and clarity or buries it under tiny scratches you’ll chase for hours. You pause with a fresh disc in your hand, the choice still nagging: pressure-sensitive adhesive (PSA) or hook and loop. You’ve heard the arguments in every shop and forum. PSA sanding discs promise the firmest connection and dead-flat contact; hook and loop offers quick swaps and forgiving feel across curves and edges. Today, it isn’t about brand loyalty. It’s about getting this surface right the first time.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/psa-versus-hook-and-loop-sanding-use-cases-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/psa-versus-hook-and-loop-sanding-use-cases-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/psa-versus-hook-and-loop-sanding-use-cases-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/psa-versus-hook-and-loop-sanding-use-cases-psa-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/psa-versus-hook-and-loop-sanding-use-cases-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/psa-versus-hook-and-loop-sanding-use-cases-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/psa-versus-hook-and-loop-sanding-use-cases-psa-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/psa-versus-hook-and-loop-sanding-use-cases-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/psa-versus-hook-and-loop-sanding-use-cases-psa-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/psa-versus-hook-and-loop-sanding-use-cases-psa-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/psa-versus-hook-and-loop-sanding-use-cases-psa-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/psa-versus-hook-and-loop-sanding-use-cases-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/psa-versus-hook-and-loop-sanding-use-cases-psa-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/psa-versus-hook-and-loop-sanding-use-cases-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/psa-versus-hook-and-loop-sanding-use-cases-psa-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/psa-versus-hook-and-loop-sanding-use-cases-psa-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/psa-versus-hook-and-loop-sanding-use-cases-psa-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/psa-versus-hook-and-loop-sanding-use-cases-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/psa-versus-hook-and-loop-sanding-use-cases-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/psa-versus-hook-and-loop-sanding-use-cases-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/psa-versus-hook-and-loop-sanding-use-cases-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/psa-versus-hook-and-loop-sanding-use-cases-psa-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/psa-versus-hook-and-loop-sanding-use-cases-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/psa-versus-hook-and-loop-sanding-use-cases-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Track And Tension Sanding Belts Properly</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/track-and-tension-sanding-belts-properly-sanding-belts/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/track-and-tension-sanding-belts-properly-sanding-belts/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 05 Nov 2025 18:06:04 +0000</pubDate><category>Sanding Belts &amp; Machines</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-150</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>Engineer-tested methods to track and tension sanding belts for stable cuts, longer life, and better finishes—plus diagnostics, calibration, and material</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="how-to-track-and-tension-sanding-belts-right"&gt;How to Track and Tension Sanding Belts Right&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still remember the first time a belt sander reminded me who’s boss. I was flattening a salvaged maple countertop in a cold garage, heater humming, coffee cooling. The sander sounded healthy at idle, but as soon as I leaned into it, the belt crept right, kissed the guard, and started singing. Within thirty seconds, grains glazed over on one edge, dust plumed unevenly, and the finish was streaky. I backed off, re-centered, nudged the tracking knob a hair, and tried again. Same result—only now the seam thumped every revolution. The culprit wasn’t just a “bad belt.” It was a bad setup: improper tension and unstable tracking.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/track-and-tension-sanding-belts-properly-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/track-and-tension-sanding-belts-properly-sanding-belts.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/track-and-tension-sanding-belts-properly-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/track-and-tension-sanding-belts-properly-sanding-belts.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/track-and-tension-sanding-belts-properly-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/track-and-tension-sanding-belts-properly-sanding-belts.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/track-and-tension-sanding-belts-properly-sanding-belts/cards/instagram/track-and-tension-sanding-belts-properly-sanding-belts.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/track-and-tension-sanding-belts-properly-sanding-belts/cards/instagram/track-and-tension-sanding-belts-properly-sanding-belts.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/track-and-tension-sanding-belts-properly-sanding-belts/cards/instagram/track-and-tension-sanding-belts-properly-sanding-belts.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/track-and-tension-sanding-belts-properly-sanding-belts/cards/pinterest/track-and-tension-sanding-belts-properly-sanding-belts.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/track-and-tension-sanding-belts-properly-sanding-belts/cards/pinterest/track-and-tension-sanding-belts-properly-sanding-belts.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/track-and-tension-sanding-belts-properly-sanding-belts/cards/pinterest/track-and-tension-sanding-belts-properly-sanding-belts.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/track-and-tension-sanding-belts-properly-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/track-and-tension-sanding-belts-properly-sanding-belts.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/track-and-tension-sanding-belts-properly-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/track-and-tension-sanding-belts-properly-sanding-belts.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/track-and-tension-sanding-belts-properly-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/track-and-tension-sanding-belts-properly-sanding-belts.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Keep Surfaces Flat With Rigid Blocks</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 05 Nov 2025 15:23:32 +0000</pubDate><category>Sanding Blocks</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>sanding block</category><description>Learn how rigid sanding blocks keep surfaces flat, when to use them, and the techniques, materials, and tips that deliver flawless, true results.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="keep-surfaces-flat-with-a-rigid-sanding-block"&gt;Keep Surfaces Flat with a Rigid Sanding Block&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a moment in any refinishing project when your eye catches the light just right and you see it: subtle waves in a tabletop, a faint ripple in primer, a break in the reflections across a glossy guitar body. You feel it with your fingertips too—those barely-there rises and dips that make the difference between “good enough” and “crafted.” I remember the first time I noticed how my results changed when I switched from a soft pad to a rigid sanding block. The surface I thought was “close” suddenly told the truth. Within a few careful passes, the highs dulled evenly and the lows showed as untouched pencil marks. In minutes, the surface was flatter than I’d ever achieved before.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/cards/facebook/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/cards/facebook/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/cards/facebook/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/cards/instagram/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/cards/instagram/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/cards/instagram/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/cards/facebook/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/cards/facebook/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/cards/facebook/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>13</readingTime></item><item><title>Sand Tight Corners With Mouse Sander</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/sand-tight-corners-with-mouse-sander-detail-sander-sheets/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/sand-tight-corners-with-mouse-sander-detail-sander-sheets/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 05 Nov 2025 14:24:31 +0000</pubDate><category>Detail Sander Sheets</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Learn how to sand tight corners with a mouse sander and detail sander sheets.

&lt;p&gt;The first time I rescued an old maple dresser, the corners told the story: paint packed like frosting into the seams, varnish hardened in the fillets, and decades of nicks rounding over what were once crisp lines. A random orbital couldn’t reach. A hand block took forever. But a small triangular pad on a mouse sander, paired with the right detail sander sheets, slipped into the geometry like it was designed for the job—because it was. That’s the magic. Tight corners stop being dead ends and start becoming checkpoints you can actually conquer.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/sand-tight-corners-with-mouse-sander-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/sand-tight-corners-with-mouse-sander-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/sand-tight-corners-with-mouse-sander-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/sand-tight-corners-with-mouse-sander-detail-sander-sheets.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/sand-tight-corners-with-mouse-sander-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/sand-tight-corners-with-mouse-sander-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/sand-tight-corners-with-mouse-sander-detail-sander-sheets/cards/instagram/sand-tight-corners-with-mouse-sander-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/sand-tight-corners-with-mouse-sander-detail-sander-sheets/cards/instagram/sand-tight-corners-with-mouse-sander-detail-sander-sheets.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/sand-tight-corners-with-mouse-sander-detail-sander-sheets/cards/instagram/sand-tight-corners-with-mouse-sander-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/sand-tight-corners-with-mouse-sander-detail-sander-sheets/cards/pinterest/sand-tight-corners-with-mouse-sander-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/sand-tight-corners-with-mouse-sander-detail-sander-sheets/cards/pinterest/sand-tight-corners-with-mouse-sander-detail-sander-sheets.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/sand-tight-corners-with-mouse-sander-detail-sander-sheets/cards/pinterest/sand-tight-corners-with-mouse-sander-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/sand-tight-corners-with-mouse-sander-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/sand-tight-corners-with-mouse-sander-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/sand-tight-corners-with-mouse-sander-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/sand-tight-corners-with-mouse-sander-detail-sander-sheets.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/sand-tight-corners-with-mouse-sander-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/sand-tight-corners-with-mouse-sander-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Difference Between Da And Random Orbital Sanding</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 05 Nov 2025 13:35:28 +0000</pubDate><category>Random Orbital Sanding</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>dust control</category><category>clear coat</category><category>orbital sander</category><description>An engineer’s guide to the difference between DA and random orbital sanding, with test-based advice on speed, finish, abrasives, and setup.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="da-vs-random-orbital-sanding-an-engineers-guide"&gt;DA vs random orbital sanding: an engineer’s guide&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning in the shop, the kettle clicks off as the garage door rolls up and a slab of maple waits on the sawhorses. The winter light is unforgiving; it shows every swirl that last year’s “good enough” sanding left behind. In one hand: a well-balanced 5-inch palm sander; in the other: a heavier, gear-driven unit that can bulldoze epoxy ridges like a planer. The decision—random orbital sanding or the so-called DA—doesn’t feel philosophical. It’s practical. Do I want a fast, aggressive cut to level those glue lines, or a controlled, low-risk finish for the final passes? If you’ve ever chased phantom swirls under a bright lamp or watched edges burn through because you leaned a degree too far, you know the stakes.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/instagram/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/instagram/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/instagram/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/pinterest/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/pinterest/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/pinterest/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Identify Surface Rust Versus Scale And Perforation</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/identify-surface-rust-versus-scale-and-perforation-rust-repair/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/identify-surface-rust-versus-scale-and-perforation-rust-repair/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 05 Nov 2025 04:10:19 +0000</pubDate><category>Metal Polishing &amp; Rust Repair</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>rust removal</category><description>Engineer’s guide to identify surface rust, scale, and perforation, with testing methods, abrasives, and rust repair decisions for lasting results.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="rust-repair-spotting-surface-scale-and-perforation"&gt;Rust Repair: Spotting Surface, Scale, and Perforation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning light caught the fender of my old wagon just right, the way it sometimes does when you’re not quite awake and not quite rushing. A faint blister under the paint telegraphed something I’ve learned to notice: the subtle topography of oxidation. It’s the kind of moment most of us meet with a sigh and a glance away. I paused instead. As a product engineer who’s spent years testing abrasives, primers, and coatings, I’ve learned that the difference between a quick cosmetic tune-up and a structural failure starts with how we look at rust—and how early we decide to act on it. Whether you wrench on weekends or you’re planning a professional rust repair, the first step is classification. Is it only surface rust that can be abraded clean? Is it scale that has undermined the steel layers? Or is it perforation where oxygen and time have already won a hole through the sheet?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/identify-surface-rust-versus-scale-and-perforation-rust-repair/cards/facebook/identify-surface-rust-versus-scale-and-perforation-rust-repair.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/identify-surface-rust-versus-scale-and-perforation-rust-repair/cards/facebook/identify-surface-rust-versus-scale-and-perforation-rust-repair.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/identify-surface-rust-versus-scale-and-perforation-rust-repair/cards/facebook/identify-surface-rust-versus-scale-and-perforation-rust-repair.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/identify-surface-rust-versus-scale-and-perforation-rust-repair/cards/instagram/identify-surface-rust-versus-scale-and-perforation-rust-repair.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/identify-surface-rust-versus-scale-and-perforation-rust-repair/cards/instagram/identify-surface-rust-versus-scale-and-perforation-rust-repair.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/identify-surface-rust-versus-scale-and-perforation-rust-repair/cards/instagram/identify-surface-rust-versus-scale-and-perforation-rust-repair.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/identify-surface-rust-versus-scale-and-perforation-rust-repair/cards/pinterest/identify-surface-rust-versus-scale-and-perforation-rust-repair.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/identify-surface-rust-versus-scale-and-perforation-rust-repair/cards/pinterest/identify-surface-rust-versus-scale-and-perforation-rust-repair.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/identify-surface-rust-versus-scale-and-perforation-rust-repair/cards/pinterest/identify-surface-rust-versus-scale-and-perforation-rust-repair.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/identify-surface-rust-versus-scale-and-perforation-rust-repair/cards/facebook/identify-surface-rust-versus-scale-and-perforation-rust-repair.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/identify-surface-rust-versus-scale-and-perforation-rust-repair/cards/facebook/identify-surface-rust-versus-scale-and-perforation-rust-repair.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/identify-surface-rust-versus-scale-and-perforation-rust-repair/cards/facebook/identify-surface-rust-versus-scale-and-perforation-rust-repair.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Proper Panel Degreasing Before Sanding And Painting</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/proper-panel-degreasing-before-sanding-and-painting-car-surface-prep/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/proper-panel-degreasing-before-sanding-and-painting-car-surface-prep/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 05 Nov 2025 00:02:33 +0000</pubDate><category>Auto Body Sanding</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>paint prep</category><category>dust control</category><description>Learn proper panel degreasing for car surface prep: the solvents, steps, and shop tips to avoid fisheyes and get paint to stick like it should.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="car-surface-prep-proper-panel-degreasing"&gt;Car Surface Prep: Proper Panel Degreasing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning, shop door cracked open, coffee perched on the fender, and a faint citrus-solvent smell in the air. That’s the moment I love most: quiet, focused, and full of possibility. You tape off the trim, set your DA sander on the cart, and reach for a clean set of nitrile gloves. If you’ve ever laid down a base coat only to watch it crater into fisheyes or peel at the edges, you know the pain of skipping a step in car surface prep. Most of the time the culprit isn’t your gun, your paint, or the weather—it’s contamination that never should have made it to the paint stage.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/proper-panel-degreasing-before-sanding-and-painting-car-surface-prep/cards/facebook/proper-panel-degreasing-before-sanding-and-painting-car-surface-prep.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/proper-panel-degreasing-before-sanding-and-painting-car-surface-prep/cards/facebook/proper-panel-degreasing-before-sanding-and-painting-car-surface-prep.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/proper-panel-degreasing-before-sanding-and-painting-car-surface-prep/cards/facebook/proper-panel-degreasing-before-sanding-and-painting-car-surface-prep.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/proper-panel-degreasing-before-sanding-and-painting-car-surface-prep/cards/instagram/proper-panel-degreasing-before-sanding-and-painting-car-surface-prep.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/proper-panel-degreasing-before-sanding-and-painting-car-surface-prep/cards/instagram/proper-panel-degreasing-before-sanding-and-painting-car-surface-prep.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/proper-panel-degreasing-before-sanding-and-painting-car-surface-prep/cards/instagram/proper-panel-degreasing-before-sanding-and-painting-car-surface-prep.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/proper-panel-degreasing-before-sanding-and-painting-car-surface-prep/cards/pinterest/proper-panel-degreasing-before-sanding-and-painting-car-surface-prep.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/proper-panel-degreasing-before-sanding-and-painting-car-surface-prep/cards/pinterest/proper-panel-degreasing-before-sanding-and-painting-car-surface-prep.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/proper-panel-degreasing-before-sanding-and-painting-car-surface-prep/cards/pinterest/proper-panel-degreasing-before-sanding-and-painting-car-surface-prep.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/proper-panel-degreasing-before-sanding-and-painting-car-surface-prep/cards/facebook/proper-panel-degreasing-before-sanding-and-painting-car-surface-prep.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/proper-panel-degreasing-before-sanding-and-painting-car-surface-prep/cards/facebook/proper-panel-degreasing-before-sanding-and-painting-car-surface-prep.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/proper-panel-degreasing-before-sanding-and-painting-car-surface-prep/cards/facebook/proper-panel-degreasing-before-sanding-and-painting-car-surface-prep.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Best Grit For Deck Sanding Before Staining</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/best-grit-for-deck-sanding-before-staining-deck-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/best-grit-for-deck-sanding-before-staining-deck-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 04 Nov 2025 19:32:49 +0000</pubDate><category>Floor &amp; Deck Sanding</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-320</category><category>deck sanding</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Engineer-tested guide to the best grit for deck sanding before staining, with abrasive science, tool choices, and proven sanding sequences.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="best-grit-for-deck-sanding-before-staining"&gt;Best Grit for Deck Sanding Before Staining&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning sunlight hits the deck and it looks like two decks at once: the cheerful gathering place you want for the season ahead, and the weathered surface you’ve come to ignore—grayed, patchy stain, a couple of raised splinters in the traffic lane from the back door. If you’ve decided to refresh it, you’ll run into a deceptively technical question right away: what’s the best grit for deck sanding before staining? As a product engineer who field-tests tools and abrasives, I’ve learned that grit choice isn’t a cosmetic preference—it’s a performance variable that decides how well stain bonds, how evenly it soaks, and how long your finish resists UV and foot traffic. In deck sanding, you aren’t polishing furniture; you’re tuning the surface profile to balance penetration and smoothness.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/best-grit-for-deck-sanding-before-staining-deck-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-for-deck-sanding-before-staining-deck-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/best-grit-for-deck-sanding-before-staining-deck-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-for-deck-sanding-before-staining-deck-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/best-grit-for-deck-sanding-before-staining-deck-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-for-deck-sanding-before-staining-deck-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/best-grit-for-deck-sanding-before-staining-deck-sanding/cards/instagram/best-grit-for-deck-sanding-before-staining-deck-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/best-grit-for-deck-sanding-before-staining-deck-sanding/cards/instagram/best-grit-for-deck-sanding-before-staining-deck-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/best-grit-for-deck-sanding-before-staining-deck-sanding/cards/instagram/best-grit-for-deck-sanding-before-staining-deck-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/best-grit-for-deck-sanding-before-staining-deck-sanding/cards/pinterest/best-grit-for-deck-sanding-before-staining-deck-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/best-grit-for-deck-sanding-before-staining-deck-sanding/cards/pinterest/best-grit-for-deck-sanding-before-staining-deck-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/best-grit-for-deck-sanding-before-staining-deck-sanding/cards/pinterest/best-grit-for-deck-sanding-before-staining-deck-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/best-grit-for-deck-sanding-before-staining-deck-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-for-deck-sanding-before-staining-deck-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/best-grit-for-deck-sanding-before-staining-deck-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-for-deck-sanding-before-staining-deck-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/best-grit-for-deck-sanding-before-staining-deck-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-for-deck-sanding-before-staining-deck-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Low Voc Binder Options For Abrasives</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 04 Nov 2025 03:24:31 +0000</pubDate><category>Eco &amp; Non-Toxic Abrasives</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-800</category><category>sanding block</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>clear coat</category><description>Low-VOC binder guide for eco sandpaper: materials, performance tradeoffs, and a step-by-step shop workflow for cleaner, pro-grade sanding.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="eco-sandpaper-low-voc-binder-options-that-work"&gt;Eco Sandpaper: Low-VOC Binder Options That Work&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know that smell the minute you crack open the shop on a warm morning—the stale bite of solvents baked into the air, the stuff that lingers in your nose long after the last pass with the sanding block. That’s the old world of abrasives talking. As a cabinetmaker turned workshop coach, I’ve logged hundreds of hours testing sheets, belts, and discs that either left my head buzzing or my surfaces butter-smooth. These days, the best of both worlds is real: low-VOC binders in eco sandpaper that can hold grit like a bulldog, resist loading, and let you breathe easier in a small shop without a giant extractor humming all day.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/cards/instagram/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/cards/instagram/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/cards/instagram/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/low-voc-binder-options-for-abrasives-eco-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Compare Disc Life And Cut Rate</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/compare-disc-life-and-cut-rate-best-sandpaper-brand/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/compare-disc-life-and-cut-rate-best-sandpaper-brand/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 04 Nov 2025 03:12:55 +0000</pubDate><category>Brand &amp; Quality Comparison</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>dust control</category><description>Engineer’s test comparing disc life and cut rate to pick the best sandpaper brand, with tips, brand picks, and methods for wood and finish sanding.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="best-sandpaper-brand-disc-life-vs-cut-rate"&gt;Best sandpaper brand: disc life vs cut rate&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still remember the first time I tried to rescue my grandmother’s maple kitchen table. The top was a scabbed map of water rings and burnished scratches, the kind of patina that tells a story but divides a family: refinish or preserve. I set the random-orbit sander on the surface, clicked on the dust extractor, and braced for the ritual dance—slow passes, overlapping lanes, listening for that pitch that says the abrasive is biting. Ten minutes in, the first disc glazed. I swapped brands, then grits. Some discs cut fast but shed grit like confetti. Others ran cool but bogged down in resin-rich end grain. At the end of that long Saturday, I wasn’t just evaluating a finish. I was reevaluating my trust in consumables.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/compare-disc-life-and-cut-rate-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/facebook/compare-disc-life-and-cut-rate-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/compare-disc-life-and-cut-rate-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/facebook/compare-disc-life-and-cut-rate-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/compare-disc-life-and-cut-rate-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/facebook/compare-disc-life-and-cut-rate-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/compare-disc-life-and-cut-rate-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/instagram/compare-disc-life-and-cut-rate-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/compare-disc-life-and-cut-rate-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/instagram/compare-disc-life-and-cut-rate-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/compare-disc-life-and-cut-rate-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/instagram/compare-disc-life-and-cut-rate-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/compare-disc-life-and-cut-rate-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/pinterest/compare-disc-life-and-cut-rate-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/compare-disc-life-and-cut-rate-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/pinterest/compare-disc-life-and-cut-rate-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/compare-disc-life-and-cut-rate-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/pinterest/compare-disc-life-and-cut-rate-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/compare-disc-life-and-cut-rate-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/facebook/compare-disc-life-and-cut-rate-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/compare-disc-life-and-cut-rate-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/facebook/compare-disc-life-and-cut-rate-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/compare-disc-life-and-cut-rate-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/facebook/compare-disc-life-and-cut-rate-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>14</readingTime></item><item><title>Open Versus Closed Coat Applications</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/open-versus-closed-coat-applications-open-coat-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/open-versus-closed-coat-applications-open-coat-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 04 Nov 2025 03:03:10 +0000</pubDate><category>Backing Types &amp; Coatings</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><description>Learn when to use open vs closed coat sandpaper for cleaner cuts, faster stock removal, and flawless finishes across wood, metal, and composites.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="open-coat-sandpaper-vs-closed-coat-pro-workflows"&gt;Open Coat Sandpaper vs Closed Coat: Pro Workflows&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fresh sheet on a random-orbit sander tells you a lot in the first few seconds: the pitch of the motor settles, dust streams through the holes, and the panel under your palm either glides or grabs. On a soft pine shelf heavy with resin, the wrong abrasive loads so fast you can smell the heat within a minute. The scratch blends into a smeared sheen, then the pad starts skating—not cutting. You lift the sander and the disc is glazed with gummy dust cakes. The fix isn’t more pressure or another pass; it’s choosing the right coat density. That’s where open coat sandpaper, with intentional spacing between grains, changes the whole day’s trajectory.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/open-versus-closed-coat-applications-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/open-versus-closed-coat-applications-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/open-versus-closed-coat-applications-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/open-versus-closed-coat-applications-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/open-versus-closed-coat-applications-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/open-versus-closed-coat-applications-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/open-versus-closed-coat-applications-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/instagram/open-versus-closed-coat-applications-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/open-versus-closed-coat-applications-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/instagram/open-versus-closed-coat-applications-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/open-versus-closed-coat-applications-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/instagram/open-versus-closed-coat-applications-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/open-versus-closed-coat-applications-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/open-versus-closed-coat-applications-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/open-versus-closed-coat-applications-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/open-versus-closed-coat-applications-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/open-versus-closed-coat-applications-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/open-versus-closed-coat-applications-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/open-versus-closed-coat-applications-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/open-versus-closed-coat-applications-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/open-versus-closed-coat-applications-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/open-versus-closed-coat-applications-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/open-versus-closed-coat-applications-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/open-versus-closed-coat-applications-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>When Ceramic Outperforms Aluminum Oxide</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 13:34:14 +0000</pubDate><category>Ceramic &amp; Premium Abrasives</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-180</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>dry sanding</category><category>clear coat</category><category>orbital sander</category><category>dust control</category><description>Learn when ceramic sanding discs beat aluminum oxide: cut rate, heat control, cost per part, and pro tips for metal, wood, and composites.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="when-ceramic-sanding-discs-outperform-aluminum-oxide"&gt;When Ceramic Sanding Discs Outperform Aluminum Oxide&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a quiet Saturday morning, the garage becomes your studio. You’ve cleared a workbench, lined up clamps and rags, and lit the space with a warm shop lamp. The project is personal: a welded steel coffee table for the living room, something sturdy and simple that can hold the weight of everyday life. The first passes with a grinder feel hopeful—until the discs start glazing. Heat builds, paint smears, and the cut slows to a crawl. You switch to a finer grit, then back again, but the aluminum oxide discs keep dulling, forcing you to lean harder. The surface looks scuffed but not flat, and your shoulders ache from forcing the tool to do what the abrasive simply won’t.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Fepa Versus Cami Grit Equivalence</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/fepa-versus-cami-grit-equivalence-sandpaper-grit-chart/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/fepa-versus-cami-grit-equivalence-sandpaper-grit-chart/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 05:30:23 +0000</pubDate><category>Grit Guide &amp; Education</category><category>grit chart</category><category>abrasive standards</category><category>grit progression</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><description>Engineer’s guide to FEPA vs CAMI grit equivalence with a practical sandpaper grit chart, testing data, and clear tips for wood, metal, and auto finishes.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="fepa-vs-cami-a-practical-sandpaper-grit-chart"&gt;FEPA vs CAMI: A Practical Sandpaper Grit Chart&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It starts with a Saturday I swore would stay simple: flatten the maple tabletop, ease the edges, oil by sunset. I had a stack of sheets from two shops—some labeled P120 and P240, others just 120 and 220. When sunlight hit the tabletop at a shallow angle, I could see crosshatched scratches ghosting under the grain. I stepped through abrasives the way I always do, yet the finish looked inconsistent. I grabbed a sandpaper grit chart I’d printed months ago, the kind that tries to equate FEPA “P” grades and U.S. CAMI numbers. The numbers lined up on paper, but my surface still didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/fepa-versus-cami-grit-equivalence-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/fepa-versus-cami-grit-equivalence-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/fepa-versus-cami-grit-equivalence-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/fepa-versus-cami-grit-equivalence-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/fepa-versus-cami-grit-equivalence-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/fepa-versus-cami-grit-equivalence-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/fepa-versus-cami-grit-equivalence-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/instagram/fepa-versus-cami-grit-equivalence-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/fepa-versus-cami-grit-equivalence-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/instagram/fepa-versus-cami-grit-equivalence-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/fepa-versus-cami-grit-equivalence-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/instagram/fepa-versus-cami-grit-equivalence-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/fepa-versus-cami-grit-equivalence-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/pinterest/fepa-versus-cami-grit-equivalence-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/fepa-versus-cami-grit-equivalence-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/pinterest/fepa-versus-cami-grit-equivalence-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/fepa-versus-cami-grit-equivalence-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/pinterest/fepa-versus-cami-grit-equivalence-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/fepa-versus-cami-grit-equivalence-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/fepa-versus-cami-grit-equivalence-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/fepa-versus-cami-grit-equivalence-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/fepa-versus-cami-grit-equivalence-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/fepa-versus-cami-grit-equivalence-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/fepa-versus-cami-grit-equivalence-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>13</readingTime></item><item><title>When To Use Soft Versus Firm Interface Pads</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 05:14:43 +0000</pubDate><category>Interface Pads &amp; Backing Pads</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>clear coat</category><description>Learn when to use soft vs firm sander interface pads for smoother finishes, faster leveling, and fewer defects across woodworking and auto refinishing.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="soft-vs-firm-sander-interface-pad-when-to-choose"&gt;Soft vs Firm Sander Interface Pad: When to Choose&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It starts with dust floating in the morning light and a project that matters. Maybe it’s a maple dresser you’ve promised to refinish before the baby arrives, or a fender blend on a car that’s taken you months to prep. Your sander hums to life, and the first pass feels promising—until you notice faint scratches where the grain curves, or a rounded edge where you wanted a crisp line. The tool didn’t change. The abrasive didn’t change. The difference is the cushion between them: the sander interface pad. It’s a small layer, but it decides how much pressure reaches the surface, how evenly the grit cuts, and whether the final result shows craftsmanship or compromise.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/instagram/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/instagram/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/instagram/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/pinterest/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/pinterest/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/pinterest/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Velcro Disc Attachment For Orbital Sanders</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 04:51:13 +0000</pubDate><category>Hook-and-Loop Discs</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>orbital sander</category><description>Engineer-tested guide to hook and loop sanding discs, from pad heat and disc selection to failure modes, setup tips, and performance tests.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="hook-and-loop-sanding-discs-for-orbital-sanders"&gt;Hook and Loop Sanding Discs for Orbital Sanders&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Saturday morning in the shop starts with optimism—the kind that comes with fresh coffee, a new sheet of maple, and the subtle hum of a random orbital sander spooling up. Ten minutes later, optimism hits the floor with the sanding disc. If you’ve been there, you know the feeling: the Velcro-style backing is glazed, the pad hooks are shiny and rounded over, and every new disc lasts a little shorter than the last. The culprit isn’t just cheap consumables; more often it’s heat, pressure, and a mismatch between tool, pad, and abrasive. This is where hook and loop sanding discs earn both their reputation for convenience and the blame when the system isn’t set up correctly.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>15</readingTime></item><item><title>Grit Sequence For Wood Belt Sanding</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/grit-sequence-for-wood-belt-sanding-sanding-belts/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/grit-sequence-for-wood-belt-sanding-sanding-belts/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 04:05:03 +0000</pubDate><category>Sanding Belts &amp; Machines</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Master the optimal grit sequence for wood belt sanding.

&lt;p&gt;You notice it the moment the light angles in—those faint stripes that refuse to disappear, telegraphing through the first coat of finish like ghosted fingerprints. They’re the memory of rushed prep, of skipped grits and overheated passes. Anyone who has carried a tabletop into the sun and watched it betray a thousand micro-scratches knows the sting. Precision starts long before the finish can, and the most reliable way to get there is a disciplined grit sequence paired with the right sanding belts. Whether you run a 37-inch wide-belt sander in a small shop or rely on a handheld belt sander to flatten stubborn stock, the same physics apply: remove the deepest scratches with efficiency, generate finer, uniform scratches, and stop at the highest grit that supports your finish system without burnishing the surface.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/grit-sequence-for-wood-belt-sanding-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/grit-sequence-for-wood-belt-sanding-sanding-belts.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/grit-sequence-for-wood-belt-sanding-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/grit-sequence-for-wood-belt-sanding-sanding-belts.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/grit-sequence-for-wood-belt-sanding-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/grit-sequence-for-wood-belt-sanding-sanding-belts.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/grit-sequence-for-wood-belt-sanding-sanding-belts/cards/instagram/grit-sequence-for-wood-belt-sanding-sanding-belts.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/grit-sequence-for-wood-belt-sanding-sanding-belts/cards/instagram/grit-sequence-for-wood-belt-sanding-sanding-belts.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/grit-sequence-for-wood-belt-sanding-sanding-belts/cards/instagram/grit-sequence-for-wood-belt-sanding-sanding-belts.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/grit-sequence-for-wood-belt-sanding-sanding-belts/cards/pinterest/grit-sequence-for-wood-belt-sanding-sanding-belts.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/grit-sequence-for-wood-belt-sanding-sanding-belts/cards/pinterest/grit-sequence-for-wood-belt-sanding-sanding-belts.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/grit-sequence-for-wood-belt-sanding-sanding-belts/cards/pinterest/grit-sequence-for-wood-belt-sanding-sanding-belts.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/grit-sequence-for-wood-belt-sanding-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/grit-sequence-for-wood-belt-sanding-sanding-belts.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/grit-sequence-for-wood-belt-sanding-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/grit-sequence-for-wood-belt-sanding-sanding-belts.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/grit-sequence-for-wood-belt-sanding-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/grit-sequence-for-wood-belt-sanding-sanding-belts.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>13</readingTime></item><item><title>Best Grit Sheets For Detail Sanding Tools</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/best-grit-sheets-for-detail-sanding-tools-detail-sander-sheets/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/best-grit-sheets-for-detail-sanding-tools-detail-sander-sheets/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 02:40:19 +0000</pubDate><category>Detail Sander Sheets</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>paint prep</category><description>Engineer-tested guide to detail sander sheets: grit selection, backings, dust control, and brand picks for wood, paint, and plastics.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="best-grit-detail-sander-sheets-an-engineers-guide"&gt;Best Grit Detail Sander Sheets: An Engineer’s Guide&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a moment in every restoration project when the big tools step aside and the small corners decide the result. I hit that moment last winter, hunched over a mid-century nightstand with tapered legs and a drawer pull recess shaped like a teardrop. My random orbit sander took care of the top in minutes, but the tight inside curves and the sharp transitions around the pull were a different story. I swapped to a detail sander and discovered what many DIYers learn the hard way: the tool is only as precise as the sheet you mount on it. The right detail sander sheets determine whether you get crisp edges and a uniform scratch or burnished tips and clogged grit.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/best-grit-sheets-for-detail-sanding-tools-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/best-grit-sheets-for-detail-sanding-tools-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/best-grit-sheets-for-detail-sanding-tools-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/best-grit-sheets-for-detail-sanding-tools-detail-sander-sheets.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/best-grit-sheets-for-detail-sanding-tools-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/best-grit-sheets-for-detail-sanding-tools-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/best-grit-sheets-for-detail-sanding-tools-detail-sander-sheets/cards/instagram/best-grit-sheets-for-detail-sanding-tools-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/best-grit-sheets-for-detail-sanding-tools-detail-sander-sheets/cards/instagram/best-grit-sheets-for-detail-sanding-tools-detail-sander-sheets.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/best-grit-sheets-for-detail-sanding-tools-detail-sander-sheets/cards/instagram/best-grit-sheets-for-detail-sanding-tools-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/best-grit-sheets-for-detail-sanding-tools-detail-sander-sheets/cards/pinterest/best-grit-sheets-for-detail-sanding-tools-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/best-grit-sheets-for-detail-sanding-tools-detail-sander-sheets/cards/pinterest/best-grit-sheets-for-detail-sanding-tools-detail-sander-sheets.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/best-grit-sheets-for-detail-sanding-tools-detail-sander-sheets/cards/pinterest/best-grit-sheets-for-detail-sanding-tools-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/best-grit-sheets-for-detail-sanding-tools-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/best-grit-sheets-for-detail-sanding-tools-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/best-grit-sheets-for-detail-sanding-tools-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/best-grit-sheets-for-detail-sanding-tools-detail-sander-sheets.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/best-grit-sheets-for-detail-sanding-tools-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/best-grit-sheets-for-detail-sanding-tools-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>13</readingTime></item><item><title>What Grit To Remove Peeling Paint From Wood Trim</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/what-grit-to-remove-peeling-paint-from-wood-trim-paint-removal-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/what-grit-to-remove-peeling-paint-from-wood-trim-paint-removal-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 00:03:42 +0000</pubDate><category>Paint Removal &amp; Surface Prep</category><category>paint prep</category><category>rust removal</category><category>primer coat</category><category>sanding block</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><description>Discover expert tips on paint removal sanding for wood trim.

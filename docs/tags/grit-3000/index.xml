&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning in the garage, the air smelled faintly of cut clear coat and soapy water. A half-finished motorcycle tank sat on a foam cradle, its orange peel and dust nibs highlighted by a raking LED panel. I’d already tried a few sheets of 1500 grit from a contractor pack, but they stalled after a few passes, loading with milky slurry and leaving stray scratches that would require more polish later. This is the moment that separates a casual sand from a dependable workflow—the point where abrasive choice dictates not just speed, but consistency and finish quality. Swapping to silicon carbide sandpaper felt like a small change, but it reset the process: faster leveling, more controllable scratch patterns, and fewer surprise defects.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/09.webp" medium="image"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Choose Pad And Compound For Plastics</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 13:37:22 +0000</pubDate><category>Resin Polishing</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>grit progression</category><category>sanding block</category><category>polishing pads</category><description>Engineer’s guide to resin polishing: pick the right pad and compound for acrylic, polycarbonate, and epoxy.

&lt;p&gt;On a quiet Saturday, I watched a friend slowly lower a buffing pad onto the cloudy edge of his epoxy river table. The coffee mugs had left fine scuffs; sunlight turned them into halos. He’d already tried an all-purpose metal polish and a “universal” wool pad—both grabbed hard, smeared the surface, and left the epoxy warmer than I liked. He looked at me and asked the question I hear weekly: “Which pad and which compound do I actually use for plastics?” It’s an honest question with costly consequences if you guess wrong. Unlike metal paint systems that tolerate a surprising amount of heat and pressure, plastics and cured resins can haze, smear, or stress-craze from a few seconds of the wrong contact.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/01.webp" medium="image"/><readingTime>13</readingTime></item><item><title>Choose Wool Foam Or Microfiber Pads</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/choose-wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-polishing-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 16:03:08 +0000</pubDate><category>Polishing &amp; Finishing</category><category>mirror finish</category><category>polishing pads</category><category>grit progression</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-2500</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>clear coat</category><category>sanding block</category><description>Engineer-tested guide to choosing wool, foam, or microfiber pads—and when to pair them with polishing sandpaper—for faster, safer, glossier results.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="wool-foam-or-microfiber-pads-with-polishing-sandpaper"&gt;Wool, Foam, or Microfiber Pads with Polishing Sandpaper&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a quiet Saturday morning, you tape off the trim, load your polisher, and stare at the paint under bright LEDs. Swirls dance across the clear coat, with a few deeper scratches that refuse to disappear. You’ve got compounds lined up, pads sorted into neatly labeled bins, and sheets of polishing sandpaper ready if the defects demand leveling. Yet the question lingers: which pad material will get you there fastest, without overheating, over-thinning the clear, or leaving haze to chase?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/27.webp" medium="image"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Compound Versus Polish To Remove 2000 Grit Sanding Marks</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-to-remove-2000-grit-sanding-marks-plastic-headlight-polis/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-to-remove-2000-grit-sanding-marks-plastic-headlight-polis/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2025 13:37:28 +0000</pubDate><category>Headlight Restoration</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>clear coat</category><description>Engineer’s guide to plastic headlight polishing: compound or polish to remove 2000 grit sanding marks?

&lt;p&gt;The sun wasn’t up yet, but the garage light threw a harsh circle over the hood of a ten-year-old hatchback. I’d taped plastic sheeting around the fenders the night before, masked the trim, and laid out abrasives like a surgeon prepping instruments—400, 600, 2000. Anyone who’s driven at night behind hazed lenses knows that dim, anxious feeling—like the road keeps secrets from you. This morning was about clarity, not just looks. It was about performance. And if you’ve ever tried plastic headlight polishing after sanding to 2000 grit and still seen a spiderweb of marks in the reflection, you know the question lurking at the bottom of the bottle: compound or polish? Both promise clarity. Both spin a story of micro-abrasives and gloss. But which one actually erases the last of those 2000 grit tracks in polycarbonate, and which only glides over them?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/19.webp" medium="image"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Compound Versus Polish Differences For Clear Coat Finishing</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/compound-versus-polish-differences-for-clear-coat-finishing-paint-polishing/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2025 05:56:37 +0000</pubDate><category>Wet Sanding Clear Coat</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-2500</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>clear coat</category><category>wet sanding</category><description>Understand compound vs polish for clear coat finishing with sanding workflows, abrasive selection, and process control for defect-free paint polishing.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="paint-polishing-compound-vs-polish-for-clear-coat"&gt;Paint polishing: compound vs polish for clear coat&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Saturday morning sun can be the most unforgiving inspector you’ll ever meet. You back the car out after a late-night respray—coffee in hand, optimism high—and the light slices across the hood like a straightedge. Orange peel you knew about, sure. But then the swirls appear, whisper-fine arcs barely visible at dusk now glaring at full volume. You feel them before you see them: the drag of a microfiber catching on texture, the way your eyes follow a ghosty hologram around a curved fender. This is the moment when “wash and wax” ends and craft begins—where surface preparation, abrasive control, and paint polishing decide whether you get a mirror or a mirage.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/17.webp" medium="image"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Progressive Micron Steps For Clarity</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 08 Nov 2025 00:41:16 +0000</pubDate><category>Glass &amp; Ceramics Sanding</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-500</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>Engineer-tested guide to glass sanding using progressive micron steps for optical clarity, with media choices, wet technique, and polishing workflow.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="glass-sanding-progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity"&gt;Glass Sanding: Progressive Micron Steps for Clarity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You notice it first at breakfast—the way the morning light breaks into a haze across your coffee table. A scratch the length of a paperclip sits dead center, scattering highlights into a milky halo that wasn’t there last week. You run a fingernail across it. The catch is slight, but it’s there. It’s the same story with a watch crystal that met a brick wall one hurried afternoon, or a window panel that’s accumulated fine swirls from years of cleaning. Replacing glass is one option, but it’s expensive, wasteful, and impractical for built-ins. As a product engineer who spends an unreasonable amount of time testing abrasives, I prefer another route: controlled, progressive glass sanding that restores optical clarity rather than hides damage.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Remove 1500–2000 Grit Marks On Resin</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 07 Nov 2025 23:56:25 +0000</pubDate><category>Resin Polishing</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-1200</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-2500</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>dust control</category><description>Expert workflows to remove 1500–2000 grit marks on resin and achieve optical clarity with the right abrasives, compounds, and heat control.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="resin-polishing-erasing-15002000-grit-scratches"&gt;Resin Polishing: Erasing 1500–2000 Grit Scratches&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pendant looked flawless on the bench last night—glassy, color suspended in amber, edges softened just so. Then morning light hit it. Under a low-angle window beam, micro-scratches flared across the surface like frost on a windshield. You could feel your shoulders sag. You did the careful wet-sand through 1500 and 2000, kept the strokes even, swirled the slurry away. It should be done. But resin is unforgiving under raking light, and 1500–2000 grit marks hang on, whisper-thin but brutally visible. This is the moment where the craft turns from “sanding” to resin polishing: closing the cut, controlling heat, and stepping the abrasive system with intent until the surface stops being a surface and becomes a reflection.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><readingTime>9</readingTime></item><item><title>Soap To Water Ratio For Lubrication</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/soap-to-water-ratio-for-lubrication-wet-dry-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 07 Nov 2025 14:24:10 +0000</pubDate><category>Waterproof &amp; Wet/Dry Paper</category><category>grit-360</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-1200</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-2500</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>sanding block</category><description>Engineer-tested soap-to-water ratios for lubricating wet dry sandpaper on paint, wood, and metal.

&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning, a quiet garage, and a project you’ve promised yourself you’d finally finish. The headlight lenses are foggy. The table top has those telltale dust nibs in the polyurethane. A chef’s knife hangs dull on the magnetic strip, begging for bite. You fill a bucket, reach for a bottle of soap, and lay out sheets of wet dry sandpaper—ready to get to work. And then you pause. How much soap should actually go into the water? One drop? A teaspoon? More? You’ve heard “soapy water helps it glide,” but glide isn’t the only variable that matters. There’s also bite, swarf transport, scratch control, and heat. The soap-to-water ratio dictates whether you refine fast and clean—or skate on a film that kills cutting speed and blurs feedback.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Best Wet Sanding Sequence For Plastic Headlight Lenses</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-wet-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlight-lenses-lens-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 05 Nov 2025 03:51:43 +0000</pubDate><category>Headlight Restoration</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-1200</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-2500</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>A precise, technical guide to wet lens sanding for plastic headlights—abrasives, workflows, and UV protection to restore clear, durable optics.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="best-lens-sanding-sequence-for-plastic-headlights"&gt;Best Lens Sanding Sequence for Plastic Headlights&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twilight is the worst time to discover your headlights are lying to you. Streetlights smear into blurry halos; lane markers fade into a matte wash. You feel yourself leaning forward in the seat as if posture could coax more lumens from the housings. But the problem isn’t the bulb; it’s the lens. Polycarbonate oxidizes, turns porous, and grows a diffuse surface that scatters light instead of transmitting it. That’s fixable if you stop thinking of restoration as a wipe-on miracle and start treating it like precision surface engineering. This guide is about real lens sanding—structured, wet, and sequential—not guessing with a single pad until it “looks better.”&lt;/p&gt;</summary><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Crosshatch Sanding Pattern For Even Clear Coat Leveling</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/crosshatch-sanding-pattern-for-even-clear-coat-leveling-clear-coat-leveling/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 05 Nov 2025 00:59:26 +0000</pubDate><category>Wet Sanding Clear Coat</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-2500</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>clear coat</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>sanding block</category><description>Learn the crosshatch sanding pattern for even clear coat leveling—tools, grits, steps, and pro tips for a flat, glossy, mirror-like finish.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="crosshatch-sanding-for-clear-coat-leveling"&gt;Crosshatch Sanding for Clear Coat Leveling&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You notice it first when the sun dips behind a cloud. Your car—or maybe that guitar body you’ve been refinishing—looked perfect in full daylight. But now a soft, diffused glow reveals a faint orange peel, a sprinkling of swirls, and the slightest rippling along a contour line. It’s not ruined, but it’s not the glassy surface you had in mind. The promise of a flawless finish is what pulls many of us into the workshop on a Saturday morning, and it’s what makes techniques like clear coat leveling feel less like a chore and more like craftsmanship. What you need isn’t more product or a heavier hand; it’s a repeatable way to flatten texture without taking unnecessary risks.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Use Diamond Or Sic For Glass Edges</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 23:29:24 +0000</pubDate><category>Glass &amp; Ceramics Sanding</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-280</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1200</category><category>grit-2500</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>wet sanding</category><description>Technical guide to glass sanding for chip‑free edges using diamond or SiC abrasives, with grit sequences, coolant control, and polishing workflows.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="glass-sanding-for-clean-safe-edges-diamond-vs-sic"&gt;Glass sanding for clean, safe edges: diamond vs SiC&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The moment you lift a freshly cut pane, you feel it: the edge that looks fine from arm’s length but carries invisible threats—micro-chips, stress risers, and the slight granular drag under a fingertip that says the finish is not ready for handling. Anyone who has ever fit a glass shelf, framed a museum-grade print, or repurposed a bottle knows that the edge is where projects succeed or fail. That’s where glass sanding earns its keep. Thoughtful abrasive selection and disciplined technique turn a risky raw cut into a safe, optically clean edge that won’t shed fragments, haze, or propagate cracks under load. Whether you’re tuning a small arris for furniture-grade touch or chasing an optical polish on a laminated panel, the goal is the same: remove damage quickly, control heat, and leave a tight subsurface that won’t surprise you months later.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><readingTime>14</readingTime></item><item><title>Soak Time For Wet Sanding Papers</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 19:47:57 +0000</pubDate><category>Waterproof &amp; Wet/Dry Paper</category><category>grit-280</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-1200</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>wet sanding</category><description>Learn the optimal soak times for wet dry sandpaper, how soaking affects abrasive performance, and precise workflows for wood, paint, and metal.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="wet-dry-sandpaper-soak-times-a-technical-guide"&gt;Wet Dry Sandpaper Soak Times: A Technical Guide&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shop is quiet except for the slow drip from a rinse bottle, pooling across a workbench where a clear-coated guitar body breathes under the lights. There’s a shallow tray of clean water, a few folded sheets of wet dry sandpaper, and a foam pad waiting like a promise. You press a fingertip to the lacquer—weeks of curing have left it hard, crisp, and unforgiving. You remember the last time you rushed the process and chased pigtails under a glaring shop light. Not today. Today, the water will do its work before the first stroke lands.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Difference Between Compounding And Polishing</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 02:16:29 +0000</pubDate><category>Polishing &amp; Finishing</category><category>mirror finish</category><category>polishing pads</category><category>grit progression</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-1200</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>clear coat</category><description>Learn the difference between compounding and polishing, how to choose polishing sandpaper and pads, and the step-by-step process for flawless finishes.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="compounding-vs-polishing-guide-to-polishing-sandpaper"&gt;Compounding vs Polishing: Guide to Polishing Sandpaper&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a moment every craftsperson recognizes: you step into the garage or studio, sunlight cuts across a painted panel or tabletop, and you see everything—swirls you never meant to leave, scratches that catch the light just so, a haze that dulls the color you spent hours applying. Your instinct might be to reach for the strongest product you own, but knowing the difference between compounding and polishing—and where polishing sandpaper fits—can save time, material, and the finish you’re trying to protect. Maybe it’s the clear coat on your daily driver, the lacquer on a guitar body, or the resin on a turned pen blank.

&lt;p&gt;Stepping into your garage, the scent of fresh paint still lingers in the air, mingling with the familiar aroma of motor oil and sawdust. Your latest project—a classic car restoration—is nearing completion. The bodywork shines under the fluorescent lights, but there’s one more crucial step to perfect that gleaming finish: wet sanding the clear coat.

&lt;p&gt;Late on a Sunday, the shop is quiet except for the hiss of the compressor and the low whirr of a sander walking a maple tabletop toward its final sheen. You’re on the last pass with a clean 320 grit, dust extraction pulling a neat spiral on the pad, edges feathered perfectly. Then it happens: the disc lets go. It doesn’t fling across the room; it just slumps off the pad, the pressure-sensitive adhesive mottled with shop dust, oil, and regret. You press it back on and get thirty seconds before it creeps loose again. It’s a familiar failure—and it rarely starts at the tool. It starts at the drawer where a sleeve of psa sanding discs went unsealed, where humidity found paper backers, where airborne silicones settled invisibly over weeks.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/03.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/09/store-psa-discs-to-protect-adhesive-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/store-psa-discs-to-protect-adhesive-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/09/store-psa-discs-to-protect-adhesive-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/store-psa-discs-to-protect-adhesive-psa-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/09/store-psa-discs-to-protect-adhesive-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/store-psa-discs-to-protect-adhesive-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/09/store-psa-discs-to-protect-adhesive-psa-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/store-psa-discs-to-protect-adhesive-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/09/store-psa-discs-to-protect-adhesive-psa-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/store-psa-discs-to-protect-adhesive-psa-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/09/store-psa-discs-to-protect-adhesive-psa-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/store-psa-discs-to-protect-adhesive-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/09/store-psa-discs-to-protect-adhesive-psa-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/store-psa-discs-to-protect-adhesive-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/09/store-psa-discs-to-protect-adhesive-psa-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/store-psa-discs-to-protect-adhesive-psa-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/09/store-psa-discs-to-protect-adhesive-psa-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/store-psa-discs-to-protect-adhesive-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/09/store-psa-discs-to-protect-adhesive-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/store-psa-discs-to-protect-adhesive-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/09/store-psa-discs-to-protect-adhesive-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/store-psa-discs-to-protect-adhesive-psa-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/09/store-psa-discs-to-protect-adhesive-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/store-psa-discs-to-protect-adhesive-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>When To Sand Between Coats Of Water-Based Finish</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/06/when-to-sand-between-coats-of-water-based-finish-between-coats-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/06/when-to-sand-between-coats-of-water-based-finish-between-coats-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 14:06:32 +0000</pubDate><category>Between-Coats Sanding</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-2400</category><category>orbital sander</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Learn exactly when and how to do between coats sanding on water-based finishes.

&lt;p&gt;The first time I chased a flawless water-based finish, I watched the light graze across a new maple desk and saw nothing but promise—and dust nibs. Under the shop’s afternoon sun, every tiny speck caught the eye. I had followed the schedule, measured film build, and kept a clean bench. But the finish felt slightly rough, like a fine orange peel. I knew what came next: between coats sanding. The question was not whether to sand, but when—and how—to avoid cutting through those early coats or, worse, clogging the abrasive with half-cured resin.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/16.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/06/when-to-sand-between-coats-of-water-based-finish-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/when-to-sand-between-coats-of-water-based-finish-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/06/when-to-sand-between-coats-of-water-based-finish-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/when-to-sand-between-coats-of-water-based-finish-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/06/when-to-sand-between-coats-of-water-based-finish-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/when-to-sand-between-coats-of-water-based-finish-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/06/when-to-sand-between-coats-of-water-based-finish-between-coats-sanding/cards/instagram/when-to-sand-between-coats-of-water-based-finish-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/06/when-to-sand-between-coats-of-water-based-finish-between-coats-sanding/cards/instagram/when-to-sand-between-coats-of-water-based-finish-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/06/when-to-sand-between-coats-of-water-based-finish-between-coats-sanding/cards/instagram/when-to-sand-between-coats-of-water-based-finish-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/06/when-to-sand-between-coats-of-water-based-finish-between-coats-sanding/cards/pinterest/when-to-sand-between-coats-of-water-based-finish-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/06/when-to-sand-between-coats-of-water-based-finish-between-coats-sanding/cards/pinterest/when-to-sand-between-coats-of-water-based-finish-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/06/when-to-sand-between-coats-of-water-based-finish-between-coats-sanding/cards/pinterest/when-to-sand-between-coats-of-water-based-finish-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/06/when-to-sand-between-coats-of-water-based-finish-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/when-to-sand-between-coats-of-water-based-finish-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/06/when-to-sand-between-coats-of-water-based-finish-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/when-to-sand-between-coats-of-water-based-finish-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/06/when-to-sand-between-coats-of-water-based-finish-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/when-to-sand-between-coats-of-water-based-finish-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>When To Cut And Weld Versus Treat With Converter</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/05/when-to-cut-and-weld-versus-treat-with-converter-rust-repair/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/05/when-to-cut-and-weld-versus-treat-with-converter-rust-repair/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 14:08:46 +0000</pubDate><category>Metal Polishing &amp; Rust Repair</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-800</category><category>rust removal</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Learn when to cut and weld versus treat with converter.

&lt;p&gt;The first cool Saturday of fall, you pop the garage door and that familiar smell hits—old steel, stale undercoating, coffee. You slide on a headlamp, run a hand along the rocker of the wagon you’ve promised yourself you’ll save, and the flashlight beam catches it: a chalky orange bloom creeping along a seam. Rust. It always starts innocent. You grab a pick and it whispers through a scabbed blister like a cracker—underneath, the panel is darker, softer, shocked with pits. That’s the moment that tests your resolve. Is this a quick grind and treat? Or am I cutting and welding today? This is where rust repair moves from theory to reality, and the difference between a weekend win and a year-long project is the decision you make next.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/12.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/05/when-to-cut-and-weld-versus-treat-with-converter-rust-repair/cards/facebook/when-to-cut-and-weld-versus-treat-with-converter-rust-repair.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/05/when-to-cut-and-weld-versus-treat-with-converter-rust-repair/cards/facebook/when-to-cut-and-weld-versus-treat-with-converter-rust-repair.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/05/when-to-cut-and-weld-versus-treat-with-converter-rust-repair/cards/facebook/when-to-cut-and-weld-versus-treat-with-converter-rust-repair.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/05/when-to-cut-and-weld-versus-treat-with-converter-rust-repair/cards/instagram/when-to-cut-and-weld-versus-treat-with-converter-rust-repair.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/05/when-to-cut-and-weld-versus-treat-with-converter-rust-repair/cards/instagram/when-to-cut-and-weld-versus-treat-with-converter-rust-repair.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/05/when-to-cut-and-weld-versus-treat-with-converter-rust-repair/cards/instagram/when-to-cut-and-weld-versus-treat-with-converter-rust-repair.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/05/when-to-cut-and-weld-versus-treat-with-converter-rust-repair/cards/pinterest/when-to-cut-and-weld-versus-treat-with-converter-rust-repair.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/05/when-to-cut-and-weld-versus-treat-with-converter-rust-repair/cards/pinterest/when-to-cut-and-weld-versus-treat-with-converter-rust-repair.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/05/when-to-cut-and-weld-versus-treat-with-converter-rust-repair/cards/pinterest/when-to-cut-and-weld-versus-treat-with-converter-rust-repair.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/05/when-to-cut-and-weld-versus-treat-with-converter-rust-repair/cards/facebook/when-to-cut-and-weld-versus-treat-with-converter-rust-repair.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/05/when-to-cut-and-weld-versus-treat-with-converter-rust-repair/cards/facebook/when-to-cut-and-weld-versus-treat-with-converter-rust-repair.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/05/when-to-cut-and-weld-versus-treat-with-converter-rust-repair/cards/facebook/when-to-cut-and-weld-versus-treat-with-converter-rust-repair.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>How To Achieve Paint Ready Wall Smoothness</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/03/how-to-achieve-paint-ready-wall-smoothness-wall-finishing/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/03/how-to-achieve-paint-ready-wall-smoothness-wall-finishing/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 14:09:46 +0000</pubDate><category>Drywall Sanding</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-800</category><category>dust control</category><category>joint compound</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>primer coat</category><description>Engineer-tested guide to wall finishing for paint-ready smoothness: compounds, abrasives, sanding systems, dust control, and pro tips to get flawless walls.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="wall-finishing-engineering-for-paint-ready-smoothness"&gt;Wall Finishing Engineering for Paint-Ready Smoothness&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It starts with a small annoyance that becomes impossible to unsee. Morning light slides across the living room, and suddenly the wall looks like a topographic map—shadows tracing joint lines, tiny ridges where rolled paint built up, shallow divots from a rushed patch job. You tilt your head, step closer, and feel the texture with your knuckles; the bumps catch. If you’ve been there, you also know the next moment: pulling tape off a fresh color sample and realizing the new paint only makes the unevenness louder. That’s the moment when wall finishing stops being cosmetic and becomes engineering. Smooth, paint-ready walls aren’t an accident. They’re the outcome of controlled materials, measured steps, and a willingness to test rather than guess.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/02.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/03/how-to-achieve-paint-ready-wall-smoothness-wall-finishing/cards/facebook/how-to-achieve-paint-ready-wall-smoothness-wall-finishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/03/how-to-achieve-paint-ready-wall-smoothness-wall-finishing/cards/facebook/how-to-achieve-paint-ready-wall-smoothness-wall-finishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/03/how-to-achieve-paint-ready-wall-smoothness-wall-finishing/cards/facebook/how-to-achieve-paint-ready-wall-smoothness-wall-finishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/03/how-to-achieve-paint-ready-wall-smoothness-wall-finishing/cards/instagram/how-to-achieve-paint-ready-wall-smoothness-wall-finishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/03/how-to-achieve-paint-ready-wall-smoothness-wall-finishing/cards/instagram/how-to-achieve-paint-ready-wall-smoothness-wall-finishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/03/how-to-achieve-paint-ready-wall-smoothness-wall-finishing/cards/instagram/how-to-achieve-paint-ready-wall-smoothness-wall-finishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/03/how-to-achieve-paint-ready-wall-smoothness-wall-finishing/cards/pinterest/how-to-achieve-paint-ready-wall-smoothness-wall-finishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/03/how-to-achieve-paint-ready-wall-smoothness-wall-finishing/cards/pinterest/how-to-achieve-paint-ready-wall-smoothness-wall-finishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/03/how-to-achieve-paint-ready-wall-smoothness-wall-finishing/cards/pinterest/how-to-achieve-paint-ready-wall-smoothness-wall-finishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/03/how-to-achieve-paint-ready-wall-smoothness-wall-finishing/cards/facebook/how-to-achieve-paint-ready-wall-smoothness-wall-finishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/03/how-to-achieve-paint-ready-wall-smoothness-wall-finishing/cards/facebook/how-to-achieve-paint-ready-wall-smoothness-wall-finishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/03/how-to-achieve-paint-ready-wall-smoothness-wall-finishing/cards/facebook/how-to-achieve-paint-ready-wall-smoothness-wall-finishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Best Grit To Scuff Sand Previously Painted Baseboards</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/02/best-grit-to-scuff-sand-previously-painted-baseboards-baseboard-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/02/best-grit-to-scuff-sand-previously-painted-baseboards-baseboard-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 14:57:53 +0000</pubDate><category>Trim &amp; Molding Sanding</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>Find the best grit to scuff sand previously painted baseboards.

&lt;p&gt;By the time the morning light sweeps across the hallway, every flaw in your trim becomes a quiet distraction: a chipped edge near the doorstop, a line of roller orange peel above the shoe molding, the glossy band where furniture grazed the baseboard. You run a fingertip along a suspect stretch of paint, and it feels slick, impervious—more like a plastic shell than something ready to bond with a fresh coat. It’s a moment many of us know: the desire to fix everything before the day gets busy, weighed against the fear of making it worse. That’s exactly where baseboard sanding earns its keep. It’s the technician’s shortcut to predictability—matting the sheen, leveling micro-defects, and creating a uniformly keyed surface that primer and enamel can actually bite into.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/29.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/02/best-grit-to-scuff-sand-previously-painted-baseboards-baseboard-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-to-scuff-sand-previously-painted-baseboards-baseboard-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/02/best-grit-to-scuff-sand-previously-painted-baseboards-baseboard-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-to-scuff-sand-previously-painted-baseboards-baseboard-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/02/best-grit-to-scuff-sand-previously-painted-baseboards-baseboard-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-to-scuff-sand-previously-painted-baseboards-baseboard-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/02/best-grit-to-scuff-sand-previously-painted-baseboards-baseboard-sanding/cards/instagram/best-grit-to-scuff-sand-previously-painted-baseboards-baseboard-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/02/best-grit-to-scuff-sand-previously-painted-baseboards-baseboard-sanding/cards/instagram/best-grit-to-scuff-sand-previously-painted-baseboards-baseboard-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/02/best-grit-to-scuff-sand-previously-painted-baseboards-baseboard-sanding/cards/instagram/best-grit-to-scuff-sand-previously-painted-baseboards-baseboard-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/02/best-grit-to-scuff-sand-previously-painted-baseboards-baseboard-sanding/cards/pinterest/best-grit-to-scuff-sand-previously-painted-baseboards-baseboard-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/02/best-grit-to-scuff-sand-previously-painted-baseboards-baseboard-sanding/cards/pinterest/best-grit-to-scuff-sand-previously-painted-baseboards-baseboard-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/02/best-grit-to-scuff-sand-previously-painted-baseboards-baseboard-sanding/cards/pinterest/best-grit-to-scuff-sand-previously-painted-baseboards-baseboard-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/02/best-grit-to-scuff-sand-previously-painted-baseboards-baseboard-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-to-scuff-sand-previously-painted-baseboards-baseboard-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/02/best-grit-to-scuff-sand-previously-painted-baseboards-baseboard-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-to-scuff-sand-previously-painted-baseboards-baseboard-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/02/best-grit-to-scuff-sand-previously-painted-baseboards-baseboard-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-to-scuff-sand-previously-painted-baseboards-baseboard-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Use Pencil Guide Marks To Track Sanding Progress</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/31/use-pencil-guide-marks-to-track-sanding-progress-hand-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/31/use-pencil-guide-marks-to-track-sanding-progress-hand-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 14:53:05 +0000</pubDate><category>Hand Sanding Techniques</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit progression</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>with precision.

&lt;p&gt;The garage is quiet except for the soft rasp of paper over wood. It’s early, the kind of morning when you can see your breath just a little, and the coffee hasn’t cooled yet. There’s a maple tabletop on the horses, and your first instinct is to reach for a random orbital and a handful of discs. But you pause. Today is about control, about reading the surface rather than forcing it. You sharpen a pencil and trace quick, looping witness marks across the panel, a light lattice that looks almost careless—until you start hand sanding. Stroke after deliberate stroke, the graphite becomes a progress meter, revealing the high spots that clear first and the stubborn low areas that hold onto their gray shadows. You’re not just smoothing wood; you’re mapping it in real time.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/21.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/31/use-pencil-guide-marks-to-track-sanding-progress-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/use-pencil-guide-marks-to-track-sanding-progress-hand-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/31/use-pencil-guide-marks-to-track-sanding-progress-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/use-pencil-guide-marks-to-track-sanding-progress-hand-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/31/use-pencil-guide-marks-to-track-sanding-progress-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/use-pencil-guide-marks-to-track-sanding-progress-hand-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/31/use-pencil-guide-marks-to-track-sanding-progress-hand-sanding/cards/instagram/use-pencil-guide-marks-to-track-sanding-progress-hand-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/31/use-pencil-guide-marks-to-track-sanding-progress-hand-sanding/cards/instagram/use-pencil-guide-marks-to-track-sanding-progress-hand-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/31/use-pencil-guide-marks-to-track-sanding-progress-hand-sanding/cards/instagram/use-pencil-guide-marks-to-track-sanding-progress-hand-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/31/use-pencil-guide-marks-to-track-sanding-progress-hand-sanding/cards/pinterest/use-pencil-guide-marks-to-track-sanding-progress-hand-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/31/use-pencil-guide-marks-to-track-sanding-progress-hand-sanding/cards/pinterest/use-pencil-guide-marks-to-track-sanding-progress-hand-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/31/use-pencil-guide-marks-to-track-sanding-progress-hand-sanding/cards/pinterest/use-pencil-guide-marks-to-track-sanding-progress-hand-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/31/use-pencil-guide-marks-to-track-sanding-progress-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/use-pencil-guide-marks-to-track-sanding-progress-hand-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/31/use-pencil-guide-marks-to-track-sanding-progress-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/use-pencil-guide-marks-to-track-sanding-progress-hand-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/31/use-pencil-guide-marks-to-track-sanding-progress-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/use-pencil-guide-marks-to-track-sanding-progress-hand-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Support And Availability Of Grits</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/30/support-and-availability-of-grits-best-sandpaper-brand/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/30/support-and-availability-of-grits-best-sandpaper-brand/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 14:01:33 +0000</pubDate><category>Brand &amp; Quality Comparison</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-280</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><description>A workshop guide to picking the best sandpaper brand with the right grit range, formats, and support—plus real sanding sequences and pro tips.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="choosing-the-best-sandpaper-brand-for-every-grit"&gt;Choosing the Best Sandpaper Brand for Every Grit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Late Sunday, the shop is warm and a little loud—random orbitals humming, shop vac pulling a steady whirr, and a maple tabletop glowing under fresh shellac. You’re feeling that flow where the dust hangs like a halo and every pass lines up with the grain just right. Then it happens: you reach for P320 to close the gap between P240 and P400… and the drawer is empty. You try P280 from another pack but it’s a different brand; the cut is jumpier, the stearate loads different, and the paper tears at the clip. Now you’ve got swirl marks, a 30-minute detour to the store, and a finish window slipping away. That’s the moment you learn that the best sandpaper brand isn’t just about how sharp the grit is or how long it lasts—it’s about support, continuity, and having the right grits in the formats you use, when you need them.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/17.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/30/support-and-availability-of-grits-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/facebook/support-and-availability-of-grits-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/30/support-and-availability-of-grits-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/facebook/support-and-availability-of-grits-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/30/support-and-availability-of-grits-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/facebook/support-and-availability-of-grits-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/30/support-and-availability-of-grits-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/instagram/support-and-availability-of-grits-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/30/support-and-availability-of-grits-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/instagram/support-and-availability-of-grits-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/30/support-and-availability-of-grits-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/instagram/support-and-availability-of-grits-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/30/support-and-availability-of-grits-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/pinterest/support-and-availability-of-grits-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/30/support-and-availability-of-grits-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/pinterest/support-and-availability-of-grits-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/30/support-and-availability-of-grits-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/pinterest/support-and-availability-of-grits-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/30/support-and-availability-of-grits-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/facebook/support-and-availability-of-grits-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/30/support-and-availability-of-grits-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/facebook/support-and-availability-of-grits-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/30/support-and-availability-of-grits-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/facebook/support-and-availability-of-grits-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>13</readingTime></item><item><title>Uv Exposure Considerations For Finishes</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/27/uv-exposure-considerations-for-finishes-boat-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/27/uv-exposure-considerations-for-finishes-boat-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 14:39:59 +0000</pubDate><category>Marine Sanding</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-2000</category><description>Learn boat sanding and UV-smart finishing from a pro.

&lt;p&gt;The marina was quiet, just the slap of little waves on hulls and the faint smell of salt and sunscreen left in the breeze. I ran my palm along a sunburned toerail—chalky, dry, and rough like a beach pebble. That’s what months of UV does to finishes: sucks the oils out, bleaches pigment, and opens tiny fissures that drink water. I’ve seen it a hundred times on boats that live uncovered. The fix isn’t glamorous, but it is satisfying: smart prep, disciplined boat sanding, and a finish system built to fight sunlight. If we do the work methodically, you’ll watch the surface tighten up, grain pop, and water bead the way it should.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/09.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/27/uv-exposure-considerations-for-finishes-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/uv-exposure-considerations-for-finishes-boat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/27/uv-exposure-considerations-for-finishes-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/uv-exposure-considerations-for-finishes-boat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/27/uv-exposure-considerations-for-finishes-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/uv-exposure-considerations-for-finishes-boat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/27/uv-exposure-considerations-for-finishes-boat-sanding/cards/instagram/uv-exposure-considerations-for-finishes-boat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/27/uv-exposure-considerations-for-finishes-boat-sanding/cards/instagram/uv-exposure-considerations-for-finishes-boat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/27/uv-exposure-considerations-for-finishes-boat-sanding/cards/instagram/uv-exposure-considerations-for-finishes-boat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/27/uv-exposure-considerations-for-finishes-boat-sanding/cards/pinterest/uv-exposure-considerations-for-finishes-boat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/27/uv-exposure-considerations-for-finishes-boat-sanding/cards/pinterest/uv-exposure-considerations-for-finishes-boat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/27/uv-exposure-considerations-for-finishes-boat-sanding/cards/pinterest/uv-exposure-considerations-for-finishes-boat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/27/uv-exposure-considerations-for-finishes-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/uv-exposure-considerations-for-finishes-boat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/27/uv-exposure-considerations-for-finishes-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/uv-exposure-considerations-for-finishes-boat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/27/uv-exposure-considerations-for-finishes-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/uv-exposure-considerations-for-finishes-boat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Inspect Under Raking Light For Chips</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/27/inspect-under-raking-light-for-chips-glass-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/27/inspect-under-raking-light-for-chips-glass-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 13:54:02 +0000</pubDate><category>Glass &amp; Ceramics Sanding</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1200</category><category>grit progression</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>sanding block</category><description>Learn how to inspect glass under raking light for chips, then repair and polish with controlled glass sanding, grit sequencing, and safety.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="raking-light-inspection-and-glass-sanding-basics"&gt;Raking Light Inspection and Glass Sanding Basics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A scratched backsplash, a hazy edge on a bottle you plan to turn into a lamp, the faint tick of a chip on a shower door—these are small things you don’t notice until the light hits just right. My moment was a kitchen island, late evening, phone flashlight resting on the quartz and aimed low across a new tempered-glass insert. In daylight it looked flawless. Under raking light, it told the truth: a constellation of micro-chips on the cut edge and a faint scratch arc where a coffee grinder once danced. I’ve worked on abrasive systems long enough to know two facts: defects hide in glare, and what you can’t see you can’t control. Raking light is the quickest way to see, and glass sanding—when done deliberately—is how you take control.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/07.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/27/inspect-under-raking-light-for-chips-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/inspect-under-raking-light-for-chips-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/27/inspect-under-raking-light-for-chips-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/inspect-under-raking-light-for-chips-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/27/inspect-under-raking-light-for-chips-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/inspect-under-raking-light-for-chips-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/27/inspect-under-raking-light-for-chips-glass-sanding/cards/instagram/inspect-under-raking-light-for-chips-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/27/inspect-under-raking-light-for-chips-glass-sanding/cards/instagram/inspect-under-raking-light-for-chips-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/27/inspect-under-raking-light-for-chips-glass-sanding/cards/instagram/inspect-under-raking-light-for-chips-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/27/inspect-under-raking-light-for-chips-glass-sanding/cards/pinterest/inspect-under-raking-light-for-chips-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/27/inspect-under-raking-light-for-chips-glass-sanding/cards/pinterest/inspect-under-raking-light-for-chips-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/27/inspect-under-raking-light-for-chips-glass-sanding/cards/pinterest/inspect-under-raking-light-for-chips-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/27/inspect-under-raking-light-for-chips-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/inspect-under-raking-light-for-chips-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/27/inspect-under-raking-light-for-chips-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/inspect-under-raking-light-for-chips-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/27/inspect-under-raking-light-for-chips-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/inspect-under-raking-light-for-chips-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Belts Discs And Sheets Grit Mapping</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/24/belts-discs-and-sheets-grit-mapping-sandpaper-grit-chart/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/24/belts-discs-and-sheets-grit-mapping-sandpaper-grit-chart/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 13:36:19 +0000</pubDate><category>Grit Guide &amp; Education</category><category>grit chart</category><category>abrasive standards</category><category>grit progression</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><description>A practical sandpaper grit chart guide for mapping belts, discs, and sheets, with real workshop tips to pick the right grit and finish faster.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="sandpaper-grit-chart-belts-discs-and-sheets-mapping"&gt;Sandpaper Grit Chart: Belts, Discs, and Sheets Mapping&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It always starts with a surface and a feeling. Maybe it’s the kitchen table that’s seen holiday spills, or the fender you’ve been meaning to fix, or a maple cutting board you want to make heirloom-smooth. You run your hand across it and feel the story: dents here, scratches there, a patch of stubborn paint that won’t let go. That’s the moment I reach for a notepad, not the sander. Why? Because every great finish begins on paper—specifically, with a sandpaper grit chart. If you’ve ever jumped into sanding and ended with swirl marks, burn-through, or “Why does this still look cloudy?”, the solution wasn’t more pressure or more time. It was a better map.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/22.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/24/belts-discs-and-sheets-grit-mapping-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/belts-discs-and-sheets-grit-mapping-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/24/belts-discs-and-sheets-grit-mapping-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/belts-discs-and-sheets-grit-mapping-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/24/belts-discs-and-sheets-grit-mapping-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/belts-discs-and-sheets-grit-mapping-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/24/belts-discs-and-sheets-grit-mapping-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/instagram/belts-discs-and-sheets-grit-mapping-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/24/belts-discs-and-sheets-grit-mapping-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/instagram/belts-discs-and-sheets-grit-mapping-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/24/belts-discs-and-sheets-grit-mapping-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/instagram/belts-discs-and-sheets-grit-mapping-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/24/belts-discs-and-sheets-grit-mapping-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/pinterest/belts-discs-and-sheets-grit-mapping-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/24/belts-discs-and-sheets-grit-mapping-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/pinterest/belts-discs-and-sheets-grit-mapping-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/24/belts-discs-and-sheets-grit-mapping-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/pinterest/belts-discs-and-sheets-grit-mapping-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/24/belts-discs-and-sheets-grit-mapping-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/belts-discs-and-sheets-grit-mapping-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/24/belts-discs-and-sheets-grit-mapping-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/belts-discs-and-sheets-grit-mapping-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/24/belts-discs-and-sheets-grit-mapping-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/belts-discs-and-sheets-grit-mapping-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Wet Sanding Options To Minimize Airborne Dust</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/23/wet-sanding-options-to-minimize-airborne-dust-dustless-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/23/wet-sanding-options-to-minimize-airborne-dust-dustless-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 13:49:31 +0000</pubDate><category>Dust Extraction Systems</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>dry sanding</category><category>joint compound</category><description>Engineer-tested wet sanding methods that cut airborne dust, improve finish quality, and speed cleanup.

&lt;p&gt;On a quiet Saturday, I watched sunbeams pick up a blizzard of drywall dust in a small, lived‑in apartment. The hallway was taped for paint, a crib sat two doors down, and a stack of sandpaper waited on the drop cloth. Every swipe of a sanding pole cast more white into the air. The homeowner—mask on, windows open—was doing their best, but dust still found a way into the return vents and the closets. I’ve worked in labs and on job sites long enough to know that dust damage isn’t just aesthetic; it creeps into electronics, triggers allergies, and lingers in HVAC systems for months. The question that matters to families and contractors alike becomes practical, not theoretical: can we keep the surface quality high while keeping the air clean?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/20.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/23/wet-sanding-options-to-minimize-airborne-dust-dustless-sanding/cards/facebook/wet-sanding-options-to-minimize-airborne-dust-dustless-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/23/wet-sanding-options-to-minimize-airborne-dust-dustless-sanding/cards/facebook/wet-sanding-options-to-minimize-airborne-dust-dustless-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/23/wet-sanding-options-to-minimize-airborne-dust-dustless-sanding/cards/facebook/wet-sanding-options-to-minimize-airborne-dust-dustless-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/23/wet-sanding-options-to-minimize-airborne-dust-dustless-sanding/cards/instagram/wet-sanding-options-to-minimize-airborne-dust-dustless-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/23/wet-sanding-options-to-minimize-airborne-dust-dustless-sanding/cards/instagram/wet-sanding-options-to-minimize-airborne-dust-dustless-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/23/wet-sanding-options-to-minimize-airborne-dust-dustless-sanding/cards/instagram/wet-sanding-options-to-minimize-airborne-dust-dustless-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/23/wet-sanding-options-to-minimize-airborne-dust-dustless-sanding/cards/pinterest/wet-sanding-options-to-minimize-airborne-dust-dustless-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/23/wet-sanding-options-to-minimize-airborne-dust-dustless-sanding/cards/pinterest/wet-sanding-options-to-minimize-airborne-dust-dustless-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/23/wet-sanding-options-to-minimize-airborne-dust-dustless-sanding/cards/pinterest/wet-sanding-options-to-minimize-airborne-dust-dustless-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/23/wet-sanding-options-to-minimize-airborne-dust-dustless-sanding/cards/facebook/wet-sanding-options-to-minimize-airborne-dust-dustless-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/23/wet-sanding-options-to-minimize-airborne-dust-dustless-sanding/cards/facebook/wet-sanding-options-to-minimize-airborne-dust-dustless-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/23/wet-sanding-options-to-minimize-airborne-dust-dustless-sanding/cards/facebook/wet-sanding-options-to-minimize-airborne-dust-dustless-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Blend Primer Edges Using A Sponge</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/20/blend-primer-edges-using-a-sponge-sanding-sponge/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/20/blend-primer-edges-using-a-sponge-sanding-sponge/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 13:53:37 +0000</pubDate><category>Sanding Sponges</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-280</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit progression</category><category>joint compound</category><category>dust control</category><description>Learn how to feather primer edges with a sanding sponge for invisible transitions.

&lt;p&gt;It’s early, the light is low, and an uneven patch on your wall catches a grazing beam of sun. You prepped the area last night—filled a hairline crack, primed the spot, and stepped away feeling done. But this morning, the primer edge telegraphs a hard line no topcoat could hide. If you’ve been here before, you know the difference between a near miss and a seamless finish comes down to one modest tool: a sanding sponge. Not just any abrasive will do. Foam-backed abrasives deliver conformal contact, edge control, and repeatable scratch patterns you can trust. They turn an obvious patch into a clean gradient that vanishes under paint.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/10.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/20/blend-primer-edges-using-a-sponge-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/blend-primer-edges-using-a-sponge-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/20/blend-primer-edges-using-a-sponge-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/blend-primer-edges-using-a-sponge-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/20/blend-primer-edges-using-a-sponge-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/blend-primer-edges-using-a-sponge-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/20/blend-primer-edges-using-a-sponge-sanding-sponge/cards/instagram/blend-primer-edges-using-a-sponge-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/20/blend-primer-edges-using-a-sponge-sanding-sponge/cards/instagram/blend-primer-edges-using-a-sponge-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/20/blend-primer-edges-using-a-sponge-sanding-sponge/cards/instagram/blend-primer-edges-using-a-sponge-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/20/blend-primer-edges-using-a-sponge-sanding-sponge/cards/pinterest/blend-primer-edges-using-a-sponge-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/20/blend-primer-edges-using-a-sponge-sanding-sponge/cards/pinterest/blend-primer-edges-using-a-sponge-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/20/blend-primer-edges-using-a-sponge-sanding-sponge/cards/pinterest/blend-primer-edges-using-a-sponge-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/20/blend-primer-edges-using-a-sponge-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/blend-primer-edges-using-a-sponge-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/20/blend-primer-edges-using-a-sponge-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/blend-primer-edges-using-a-sponge-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/20/blend-primer-edges-using-a-sponge-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/blend-primer-edges-using-a-sponge-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Crosshatch Passes For Flat Panel Sanding</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/18/crosshatch-passes-for-flat-panel-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/18/crosshatch-passes-for-flat-panel-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 14:18:18 +0000</pubDate><category>Random Orbital Sanding</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-1000</category><description>Engineer-tested crosshatch passes for flat panel sanding with random orbital sanding.

&lt;p&gt;The first time I truly trusted a surface was under shop lights late on a Sunday, not at noon when everything looks perfect. I had a maple tabletop on trestles, pencil grid scribbled across the face, edges taped to protect the bevel. The shop was quiet except for the steady hum of the sander—a 5-inch random orbital—drawing dust through a tidy hose looped overhead. In that light, imperfections don’t yell; they whisper. High spots break the graphite lines first. Low spots hold onto them stubbornly. I moved the machine in a measured, crosshatch pattern, alternating angles like a metronome, and watched the pencil disappear in a uniform fade rather than blotches.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/04.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/18/crosshatch-passes-for-flat-panel-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/crosshatch-passes-for-flat-panel-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/18/crosshatch-passes-for-flat-panel-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/crosshatch-passes-for-flat-panel-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/18/crosshatch-passes-for-flat-panel-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/crosshatch-passes-for-flat-panel-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/18/crosshatch-passes-for-flat-panel-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/instagram/crosshatch-passes-for-flat-panel-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/18/crosshatch-passes-for-flat-panel-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/instagram/crosshatch-passes-for-flat-panel-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/18/crosshatch-passes-for-flat-panel-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/instagram/crosshatch-passes-for-flat-panel-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/18/crosshatch-passes-for-flat-panel-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/pinterest/crosshatch-passes-for-flat-panel-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/18/crosshatch-passes-for-flat-panel-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/pinterest/crosshatch-passes-for-flat-panel-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/18/crosshatch-passes-for-flat-panel-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/pinterest/crosshatch-passes-for-flat-panel-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/18/crosshatch-passes-for-flat-panel-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/crosshatch-passes-for-flat-panel-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/18/crosshatch-passes-for-flat-panel-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/crosshatch-passes-for-flat-panel-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/18/crosshatch-passes-for-flat-panel-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/crosshatch-passes-for-flat-panel-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Identify Raised Nibs Before Sanding</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/17/identify-raised-nibs-before-sanding-between-coats-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/17/identify-raised-nibs-before-sanding-between-coats-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jan 2026 14:58:48 +0000</pubDate><category>Between-Coats Sanding</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>dry sanding</category><category>orbital sander</category><description>Learn to identify raised nibs before sanding between coats for flawless finishes.

&lt;p&gt;You set the brush down and step back. The tabletop glows under the shop lights, a fresh coat catching reflections like still water. Then you see them—tiny flecks interrupting the gloss, little bumps that snag your eye and threaten the silky-smooth finish you pictured. They’re not big flaws, just dust nibs and bits of raised grain, but you know the truth: if you sand them wrong, you’ll chase scratches, burn through edges, or trap grit that will telegraph through every coat after. The difference between good and truly great finishes often comes down to what we do before we reach for sandpaper.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/29.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/17/identify-raised-nibs-before-sanding-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/identify-raised-nibs-before-sanding-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/17/identify-raised-nibs-before-sanding-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/identify-raised-nibs-before-sanding-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/17/identify-raised-nibs-before-sanding-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/identify-raised-nibs-before-sanding-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/17/identify-raised-nibs-before-sanding-between-coats-sanding/cards/instagram/identify-raised-nibs-before-sanding-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/17/identify-raised-nibs-before-sanding-between-coats-sanding/cards/instagram/identify-raised-nibs-before-sanding-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/17/identify-raised-nibs-before-sanding-between-coats-sanding/cards/instagram/identify-raised-nibs-before-sanding-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/17/identify-raised-nibs-before-sanding-between-coats-sanding/cards/pinterest/identify-raised-nibs-before-sanding-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/17/identify-raised-nibs-before-sanding-between-coats-sanding/cards/pinterest/identify-raised-nibs-before-sanding-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/17/identify-raised-nibs-before-sanding-between-coats-sanding/cards/pinterest/identify-raised-nibs-before-sanding-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/17/identify-raised-nibs-before-sanding-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/identify-raised-nibs-before-sanding-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/17/identify-raised-nibs-before-sanding-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/identify-raised-nibs-before-sanding-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/17/identify-raised-nibs-before-sanding-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/identify-raised-nibs-before-sanding-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Clean And Degrease Surfaces Before Sanding And Priming</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/17/clean-and-degrease-surfaces-before-sanding-and-priming-surface-preparation/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/17/clean-and-degrease-surfaces-before-sanding-and-priming-surface-preparation/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jan 2026 13:34:08 +0000</pubDate><category>Paint Removal &amp; Surface Prep</category><category>paint prep</category><category>rust removal</category><category>primer coat</category><category>sanding block</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><description>Clean, degrease, then sand and prime like a pro.

&lt;p&gt;Saturday mornings in my shop start the same way: coffee steaming on the bench, drop cloths folded like fresh sails, and that itch to make something look and feel right. I’ve seen perfect paint jobs fail on day two because the prep was rushed. I’ve also watched tired cabinets come back to life simply because we took cleaning seriously.

&lt;p&gt;The afternoon light hit the hallway just right—the kind of slant that makes crisp edges glow and tiny flaws stand out like little shadows. The old crown molding you’d decided to keep (and just refresh) looked less romantic up close: nicks where movers grazed it, soft ridges from past paint jobs, and a few dips where a power sander had been a touch too enthusiastic. You ran a fingertip along the ogee, felt a wave where a clean curve should be, and realized this was not a job for brute force. It was a job for patience and precision. If you’ve tried molding sanding before, you know the paradox: the more you try to fix a profile, the easier it is to flatten it.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/13.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/12/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding/cards/facebook/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/12/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding/cards/facebook/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/12/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding/cards/facebook/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/12/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding/cards/instagram/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/12/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding/cards/instagram/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/12/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding/cards/instagram/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/12/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding/cards/pinterest/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/12/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding/cards/pinterest/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/12/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding/cards/pinterest/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/12/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding/cards/facebook/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/12/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding/cards/facebook/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/12/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding/cards/facebook/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Fix Dents And White Rings Before Applying New Finish</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 15:12:04 +0000</pubDate><category>Furniture Refinishing</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>sanding block</category><category>clear coat</category><category>dust control</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Learn how to fix dents and white rings before applying a new finish.

&lt;p&gt;Saturday light hits the dining table just right, and that’s both a blessing and a curse. You can see everything: the tiny crater where a laptop corner sank into soft oak during a late-night email sprint, the ghostly white ring from a forgotten coffee mug, the faint scratch where a science project met an impatient sponge. These are the little scars of a life well-lived—until you decide it’s time to refinish. As a workshop guy who lives for clean joins, crisp edges, and silky finishes, I’ve learned that great furniture restoration lives or dies before you ever open a finish can. If you don’t fix dents and lift white rings properly, your “new finish” just spotlights old mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/11.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration/cards/facebook/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration/cards/facebook/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration/cards/facebook/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration/cards/instagram/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration/cards/instagram/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration/cards/instagram/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration/cards/pinterest/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration/cards/pinterest/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration/cards/pinterest/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration/cards/facebook/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration/cards/facebook/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration/cards/facebook/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Identify Grain Direction Before Sanding Surfaces</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/identify-grain-direction-before-sanding-surfaces-grain-preparation/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/identify-grain-direction-before-sanding-surfaces-grain-preparation/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 13:36:01 +0000</pubDate><category>Wood sanding</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>sanding block</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Learn grain preparation: practical tests to read grain direction before sanding, abrasive science that prevents scratches, and steps for flawless finishes.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="grain-preparation-how-to-read-wood-before-sanding"&gt;Grain Preparation: How to Read Wood Before Sanding&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few Saturdays ago, I stood in the morning light with a walnut tabletop that had the right dimensions and the wrong look. Sun traced across the surface at a shallow angle, revealing every swirl left by a rushed sanding job the night before. I’d worked through my grits, vacuumed diligently, and still the surface read like a topographical map of mistakes. What changed the next pass wasn’t a fancier sander or a new finish—it was slowing down to read the wood first. Grain preparation sounds mundane, but it’s the difference between fighting a board and letting it finish itself. When you know which way the fibers lie, where they reverse, and how earlywood and latewood will respond, you save hours and achieve a surface that looks polished even before the first coat.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/09.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/identify-grain-direction-before-sanding-surfaces-grain-preparation/cards/facebook/identify-grain-direction-before-sanding-surfaces-grain-preparation.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/identify-grain-direction-before-sanding-surfaces-grain-preparation/cards/facebook/identify-grain-direction-before-sanding-surfaces-grain-preparation.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/identify-grain-direction-before-sanding-surfaces-grain-preparation/cards/facebook/identify-grain-direction-before-sanding-surfaces-grain-preparation.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/identify-grain-direction-before-sanding-surfaces-grain-preparation/cards/instagram/identify-grain-direction-before-sanding-surfaces-grain-preparation.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/identify-grain-direction-before-sanding-surfaces-grain-preparation/cards/instagram/identify-grain-direction-before-sanding-surfaces-grain-preparation.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/identify-grain-direction-before-sanding-surfaces-grain-preparation/cards/instagram/identify-grain-direction-before-sanding-surfaces-grain-preparation.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/identify-grain-direction-before-sanding-surfaces-grain-preparation/cards/pinterest/identify-grain-direction-before-sanding-surfaces-grain-preparation.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/identify-grain-direction-before-sanding-surfaces-grain-preparation/cards/pinterest/identify-grain-direction-before-sanding-surfaces-grain-preparation.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/identify-grain-direction-before-sanding-surfaces-grain-preparation/cards/pinterest/identify-grain-direction-before-sanding-surfaces-grain-preparation.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/identify-grain-direction-before-sanding-surfaces-grain-preparation/cards/facebook/identify-grain-direction-before-sanding-surfaces-grain-preparation.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/identify-grain-direction-before-sanding-surfaces-grain-preparation/cards/facebook/identify-grain-direction-before-sanding-surfaces-grain-preparation.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/identify-grain-direction-before-sanding-surfaces-grain-preparation/cards/facebook/identify-grain-direction-before-sanding-surfaces-grain-preparation.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Coating Tech To Reduce Heat And Clogging</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/10/coating-tech-to-reduce-heat-and-clogging-abrasive-testing/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/10/coating-tech-to-reduce-heat-and-clogging-abrasive-testing/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 15:28:04 +0000</pubDate><category>Abrasive Innovation &amp; Testing</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>paint prep</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Learn how coating technologies and abrasive testing reduce heat, prevent loading, and optimize sanding workflows for cleaner, faster surface prep.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="abrasive-testing-coatings-to-cut-heat-and-clogging"&gt;Abrasive Testing: Coatings to Cut Heat and Clogging&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The day starts cool, but the shop heats fast. You tape off a panel and power up the 5&amp;quot; random orbital. Within minutes, the disc is skating, resin smears streak the surface, and the pad feels hot enough to warp a finger pad. The clock is merciless. This is the moment where small choices—grain chemistry, topcoat, vacuum pattern—decide whether you flow into primer by lunch or spend the afternoon digging spent discs out of a bin. Heat and loading aren’t just nuisances; they are the leading indicators that your abrasives and process aren’t matched to the substrate, the geometry, or the dust load. That’s exactly where disciplined abrasive testing earns its keep: quantifying cut rates, temperature, and load-up so you can select coatings that stay cool and resist clogging right up to the finishing pass.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/07.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/10/coating-tech-to-reduce-heat-and-clogging-abrasive-testing/cards/facebook/coating-tech-to-reduce-heat-and-clogging-abrasive-testing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/10/coating-tech-to-reduce-heat-and-clogging-abrasive-testing/cards/facebook/coating-tech-to-reduce-heat-and-clogging-abrasive-testing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/10/coating-tech-to-reduce-heat-and-clogging-abrasive-testing/cards/facebook/coating-tech-to-reduce-heat-and-clogging-abrasive-testing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/10/coating-tech-to-reduce-heat-and-clogging-abrasive-testing/cards/instagram/coating-tech-to-reduce-heat-and-clogging-abrasive-testing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/10/coating-tech-to-reduce-heat-and-clogging-abrasive-testing/cards/instagram/coating-tech-to-reduce-heat-and-clogging-abrasive-testing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/10/coating-tech-to-reduce-heat-and-clogging-abrasive-testing/cards/instagram/coating-tech-to-reduce-heat-and-clogging-abrasive-testing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/10/coating-tech-to-reduce-heat-and-clogging-abrasive-testing/cards/pinterest/coating-tech-to-reduce-heat-and-clogging-abrasive-testing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/10/coating-tech-to-reduce-heat-and-clogging-abrasive-testing/cards/pinterest/coating-tech-to-reduce-heat-and-clogging-abrasive-testing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/10/coating-tech-to-reduce-heat-and-clogging-abrasive-testing/cards/pinterest/coating-tech-to-reduce-heat-and-clogging-abrasive-testing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/10/coating-tech-to-reduce-heat-and-clogging-abrasive-testing/cards/facebook/coating-tech-to-reduce-heat-and-clogging-abrasive-testing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/10/coating-tech-to-reduce-heat-and-clogging-abrasive-testing/cards/facebook/coating-tech-to-reduce-heat-and-clogging-abrasive-testing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/10/coating-tech-to-reduce-heat-and-clogging-abrasive-testing/cards/facebook/coating-tech-to-reduce-heat-and-clogging-abrasive-testing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Block Or Bare Hand — When To Use Each Method</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/10/block-or-bare-hand-when-to-use-each-method-hand-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/10/block-or-bare-hand-when-to-use-each-method-hand-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 13:34:24 +0000</pubDate><category>Hand Sanding Techniques</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>sanding block</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>Learn when to choose hand sanding or a sanding block for flat, curved, and detailed surfaces—plus techniques, grits, and tips for flawless results.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="hand-sanding-vs-block-when-each-method-wins"&gt;Hand sanding vs block: when each method wins&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quiet rhythm of sanding is one of the most honest sounds in making. Picture a Saturday afternoon: sunlight across the bench, a project that matters—maybe the oak table your family eats at, a guitar body you’ve been shaping for months, or a door panel you’re finally prepping for paint. You feel the surface more than you see it. The paper whispers over high spots, snags a little on a nick you missed. Instinct nudges the next move—do you keep the tactile connection of hand sanding, or pick up the block to force the surface true?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/05.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/10/block-or-bare-hand-when-to-use-each-method-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/block-or-bare-hand-when-to-use-each-method-hand-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/10/block-or-bare-hand-when-to-use-each-method-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/block-or-bare-hand-when-to-use-each-method-hand-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/10/block-or-bare-hand-when-to-use-each-method-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/block-or-bare-hand-when-to-use-each-method-hand-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/10/block-or-bare-hand-when-to-use-each-method-hand-sanding/cards/instagram/block-or-bare-hand-when-to-use-each-method-hand-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/10/block-or-bare-hand-when-to-use-each-method-hand-sanding/cards/instagram/block-or-bare-hand-when-to-use-each-method-hand-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/10/block-or-bare-hand-when-to-use-each-method-hand-sanding/cards/instagram/block-or-bare-hand-when-to-use-each-method-hand-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/10/block-or-bare-hand-when-to-use-each-method-hand-sanding/cards/pinterest/block-or-bare-hand-when-to-use-each-method-hand-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/10/block-or-bare-hand-when-to-use-each-method-hand-sanding/cards/pinterest/block-or-bare-hand-when-to-use-each-method-hand-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/10/block-or-bare-hand-when-to-use-each-method-hand-sanding/cards/pinterest/block-or-bare-hand-when-to-use-each-method-hand-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/10/block-or-bare-hand-when-to-use-each-method-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/block-or-bare-hand-when-to-use-each-method-hand-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/10/block-or-bare-hand-when-to-use-each-method-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/block-or-bare-hand-when-to-use-each-method-hand-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/10/block-or-bare-hand-when-to-use-each-method-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/block-or-bare-hand-when-to-use-each-method-hand-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Safer Solvent Choices For Wipe Downs</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/09/safer-solvent-choices-for-wipe-downs-eco-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/09/safer-solvent-choices-for-wipe-downs-eco-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 13:43:45 +0000</pubDate><category>Eco &amp; Non-Toxic Abrasives</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-320</category><description>Workshop-safe wipe-down solvents, eco sandpaper prep, and pro protocols for flawless finishes—without harsh fumes or messy residues.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="safer-wipe-down-solvents-and-eco-sandpaper-guide"&gt;Safer Wipe-Down Solvents and Eco Sandpaper Guide&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still remember the first evening I promised myself I’d stop ending shop days with a solvent headache. The project was a walnut credenza destined for our living room, and I wanted it to glow—clean pores, a silky hand, and a finish that would hold up to stray toy cars and weekend dust-offs. I reached for eco sandpaper, the vac humming softly, the pad skating from 150 to 180 grit like I’d planned. Then came the wipe-down, the moment everything either goes beautifully right or annoyingly wrong. I used to grab whatever was closest—mineral spirits, naphtha, alcohol—without a second thought. That’s when the trouble starts: reactivated dyes, smeared filler, hazing that didn’t show up until the first coat.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/03.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/09/safer-solvent-choices-for-wipe-downs-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/safer-solvent-choices-for-wipe-downs-eco-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/09/safer-solvent-choices-for-wipe-downs-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/safer-solvent-choices-for-wipe-downs-eco-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/09/safer-solvent-choices-for-wipe-downs-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/safer-solvent-choices-for-wipe-downs-eco-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/09/safer-solvent-choices-for-wipe-downs-eco-sandpaper/cards/instagram/safer-solvent-choices-for-wipe-downs-eco-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/09/safer-solvent-choices-for-wipe-downs-eco-sandpaper/cards/instagram/safer-solvent-choices-for-wipe-downs-eco-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/09/safer-solvent-choices-for-wipe-downs-eco-sandpaper/cards/instagram/safer-solvent-choices-for-wipe-downs-eco-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/09/safer-solvent-choices-for-wipe-downs-eco-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/safer-solvent-choices-for-wipe-downs-eco-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/09/safer-solvent-choices-for-wipe-downs-eco-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/safer-solvent-choices-for-wipe-downs-eco-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/09/safer-solvent-choices-for-wipe-downs-eco-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/safer-solvent-choices-for-wipe-downs-eco-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/09/safer-solvent-choices-for-wipe-downs-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/safer-solvent-choices-for-wipe-downs-eco-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/09/safer-solvent-choices-for-wipe-downs-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/safer-solvent-choices-for-wipe-downs-eco-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/09/safer-solvent-choices-for-wipe-downs-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/safer-solvent-choices-for-wipe-downs-eco-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>13</readingTime></item><item><title>Film Backed Ceramics For Uniform Scratch</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jan 2026 15:06:46 +0000</pubDate><category>Ceramic &amp; Premium Abrasives</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-280</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>dust control</category><category>clear coat</category><description>Learn how film-backed ceramic sanding discs deliver a uniform scratch pattern with better cut and control.

&lt;p&gt;You notice it first in the light. That telltale halo that appears when you shift the panel under a shop lamp, the swirl that refuses to quit even after another pass with the sander. Maybe it’s a cabinet door you’ve been nursing back to life, a car fender in primer that has to be perfect for color, or a guitar body on its third clear coat. You’re not chasing shine yet—you’re chasing uniformity. A clean, even scratch pattern is the quiet foundation of every flawless finish, and when it isn’t there, everything downstream becomes harder: filler prints through, paint mottles, topcoats telegraph the tiniest inconsistencies. The solution often starts earlier than we think—at the abrasive itself.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/10.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Edge And Profile Grit Selection</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jan 2026 13:34:23 +0000</pubDate><category>Grit Range &amp; Classification</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-101</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-280</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><description>Learn to pick the right sandpaper grit for edges and profiles.

&lt;p&gt;It starts with the first swipe on a sharp, splintery edge—maybe the oak tabletop you rescued, the cabinet door frame you’re painting for a bathroom refresh, or the picture frame for a gift that’s due tonight. In the quiet of the workshop, dust hangs in the light and you feel the edge transform under your fingers. The urge is to “just sand it” and keep going. But edges and profiles aren’t flat panels; they magnify every mistake. Round over too far and the joint line disappears. Skip a grit and scratch ghosts show up in the finish. Choose the wrong sandpaper grit and you’ll waste time or, worse, bruise a delicate profile you spent hours cutting.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/08.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit/cards/instagram/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit/cards/instagram/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit/cards/instagram/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit/cards/pinterest/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit/cards/pinterest/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit/cards/pinterest/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/edge-and-profile-grit-selection-sandpaper-grit.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Soft Interface Pad For Contour Sanding</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 13:38:32 +0000</pubDate><category>Hook-and-Loop Discs</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1200</category><description>Engineer-tested guide to soft interface pads for contour sanding and hook and loop sanding discs—materials, heat control, dust, and real-world results.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="hook-and-loop-sanding-discs-and-soft-interface-pads"&gt;Hook and Loop Sanding Discs and Soft Interface Pads&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early Sunday, the shop is quiet except for the soft thrum of a random-orbit sander. You’re easing into the inside radius of a chair arm, the kind of curve where the wood tells on you: one careless second and you’ve burned through stain on the edge. You swap to a softer setup—an interface pad between the pad and your hook and loop sanding discs—and the whole feel changes. The pad yields just enough to keep the abrasive in full contact along the curve, and the sander stops chattering. Your hands relax. The dust stream settles into the vacuum instead of fogging the bench light. The finish doesn’t scream for attention anymore; it whispers that you got the contour right.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/27.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Sequence Grits For Profiles And Corners</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 14:25:34 +0000</pubDate><category>Detail Sander Sheets</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><description>Engineer’s guide to sequencing grits for profiles and corners with detail sander sheets, including test-backed grit orders and pro tips for crisp edges</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="detail-sander-sheets-sequencing-grits-for-profiles"&gt;Detail sander sheets: sequencing grits for profiles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a Saturday morning in the shop, you pull the tape off a freshly routed maple picture frame and hit it with raking light. The ogee looks clean at first glance—but your fingertips catch tiny ridges where the cutter eased in and out, and the inside corners still show faint milling lines. You grab a delta sander, slide on a fresh pack of detail sander sheets, and take a breath. This is the moment that separates a merely “good enough” piece from one that reads crisp at arm’s length and holds up under a client’s inspection light.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/19.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets/cards/instagram/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets/cards/instagram/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets/cards/instagram/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets/cards/pinterest/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets/cards/pinterest/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets/cards/pinterest/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets/cards/facebook/sequence-grits-for-profiles-and-corners-detail-sander-sheets.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>13</readingTime></item><item><title>Avoid Cutting Through Color Coats When Sanding Between</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/29/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/29/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 13:42:54 +0000</pubDate><category>Between-Coats Sanding</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>clear coat</category><category>grit progression</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>Avoid sand-through on stained or painted projects.

&lt;p&gt;The first time I cut through a beautifully shaded guitar body, it was 11:30 p.m. in a quiet shop. The color was perfect—warm amber base, a gentle burst on the edges, and just enough depth to make the figure dance. I’d laid down two clear coats, feeling confident, and went in for a “quick scuff” before the third. Ten strokes in, the block slipped off a radius and I saw it: a pale witness line peeking through the color, a little halo of heartbreak. If you’ve ever felt that knot in your gut, you know that between coats sanding can make or break a project.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/13.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/29/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/29/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/29/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/29/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding/cards/instagram/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/29/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding/cards/instagram/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/29/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding/cards/instagram/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/29/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding/cards/pinterest/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/29/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding/cards/pinterest/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/29/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding/cards/pinterest/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/29/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/29/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/29/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/avoid-cutting-through-color-coats-when-sanding-between-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Recommended Grit Sequence For Sanding Bare Steel</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/27/recommended-grit-sequence-for-sanding-bare-steel-metal-surface-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/27/recommended-grit-sequence-for-sanding-bare-steel-metal-surface-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 27 Dec 2025 14:21:03 +0000</pubDate><category>Metal Polishing &amp; Rust Repair</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Learn the optimal grit sequence for sanding bare steel, with tooling, abrasives, and workflow guidance to maximize adhesion and finish quality.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="metal-surface-sanding-grit-sequence-for-bare-steel"&gt;Metal surface sanding: grit sequence for bare steel&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You notice it the moment the sander spins down: the hush after the rasp of grit on steel, the faint warmth still in the panel, the tiny constellation of scratch lines all pointing the same way. On Friday night, this fender looked tired—speckled with scale, a wisp of old primer clinging at the edges. Saturday morning it’s a blank canvas in progress, the steel alive again under clean, uniform scratch. Anyone who’s spent a weekend restoring a motorcycle tank or prepping a truck’s rocker knows the difference between “sanded” and “ready.” Metal surface sanding isn’t about making things shiny; it’s about engineering a surface profile that bonds mechanically with the next layer—primer, filler, sealer—without undercutting the geometry or telegraphing flaws. It’s a craft and a sequence, not just a tool choice.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/09.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/27/recommended-grit-sequence-for-sanding-bare-steel-metal-surface-sanding/cards/facebook/recommended-grit-sequence-for-sanding-bare-steel-metal-surface-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/27/recommended-grit-sequence-for-sanding-bare-steel-metal-surface-sanding/cards/facebook/recommended-grit-sequence-for-sanding-bare-steel-metal-surface-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/27/recommended-grit-sequence-for-sanding-bare-steel-metal-surface-sanding/cards/facebook/recommended-grit-sequence-for-sanding-bare-steel-metal-surface-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/27/recommended-grit-sequence-for-sanding-bare-steel-metal-surface-sanding/cards/instagram/recommended-grit-sequence-for-sanding-bare-steel-metal-surface-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/27/recommended-grit-sequence-for-sanding-bare-steel-metal-surface-sanding/cards/instagram/recommended-grit-sequence-for-sanding-bare-steel-metal-surface-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/27/recommended-grit-sequence-for-sanding-bare-steel-metal-surface-sanding/cards/instagram/recommended-grit-sequence-for-sanding-bare-steel-metal-surface-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/27/recommended-grit-sequence-for-sanding-bare-steel-metal-surface-sanding/cards/pinterest/recommended-grit-sequence-for-sanding-bare-steel-metal-surface-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/27/recommended-grit-sequence-for-sanding-bare-steel-metal-surface-sanding/cards/pinterest/recommended-grit-sequence-for-sanding-bare-steel-metal-surface-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/27/recommended-grit-sequence-for-sanding-bare-steel-metal-surface-sanding/cards/pinterest/recommended-grit-sequence-for-sanding-bare-steel-metal-surface-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/27/recommended-grit-sequence-for-sanding-bare-steel-metal-surface-sanding/cards/facebook/recommended-grit-sequence-for-sanding-bare-steel-metal-surface-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/27/recommended-grit-sequence-for-sanding-bare-steel-metal-surface-sanding/cards/facebook/recommended-grit-sequence-for-sanding-bare-steel-metal-surface-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/27/recommended-grit-sequence-for-sanding-bare-steel-metal-surface-sanding/cards/facebook/recommended-grit-sequence-for-sanding-bare-steel-metal-surface-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Da Sander Versus Random Orbital For Bodywork Preparation</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/25/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/25/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 13:37:54 +0000</pubDate><category>Auto Body Sanding</category><category>grit-40</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>orbital sander</category><description>Engineering review of DA vs RO sanding for car bodywork, with test data on removal rates, finish quality, abrasives, and cost to help you prep panels right.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="da-vs-ro-sanding-for-auto-bodywork-prep"&gt;DA vs RO sanding for Auto Bodywork Prep&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a cool Saturday morning, I wheeled a dented fender onto the stand, grabbed coffee, and stared at two sanders: a pneumatic 6-inch “DA” hanging from the air line, and a compact 5-inch corded random orbital sitting on the bench. The car—an aging hatchback—had a blend of bare metal, polyester filler, and feathered edges where clearcoat met primer. This is the exact moment many DIYers and even pros face: DA vs RO sanding for bodywork prep. You’re not choosing a philosophy; you’re choosing a process that affects dust control, scratch depth, shape fidelity, and the time you’ll spend chasing pigtails or re-spraying primer. I’ve felt the allure of the faster-cutting DA when leveling filler, and I’ve also learned the hard way that an aggressive orbit can tunnel through primer on a convex edge in seconds.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/03.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/25/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding/cards/facebook/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/25/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding/cards/facebook/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/25/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding/cards/facebook/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/25/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding/cards/instagram/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/25/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding/cards/instagram/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/25/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding/cards/instagram/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/25/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding/cards/pinterest/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/25/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding/cards/pinterest/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/25/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding/cards/pinterest/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/25/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding/cards/facebook/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/25/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding/cards/facebook/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/25/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding/cards/facebook/da-sander-versus-random-orbital-for-bodywork-preparation-da-vs-ro-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Best Sandpaper Grits For Sanding Wood</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/22/best-sandpaper-grits-for-sanding-wood-wood-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/22/best-sandpaper-grits-for-sanding-wood-wood-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 13:40:09 +0000</pubDate><category>Wood sanding</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>orbital sander</category><category>dust control</category><description>Choose the best sandpaper grits for wood sanding.

&lt;p&gt;A Saturday morning sunbeam revealed everything—the faint planer tracks on a maple tabletop, a small divot near an edge, and those whisper-thin swirls you only notice after the first coat of finish. A project that looked “almost ready” under overhead light suddenly felt two steps backward under raking light. That moment is where quality begins: in choosing the right starting grit and a disciplined progression that erases, rather than buries, defects. This is the decisive difference between passable and professional surface prep.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/22.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/22/best-sandpaper-grits-for-sanding-wood-wood-sanding/cards/facebook/best-sandpaper-grits-for-sanding-wood-wood-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/22/best-sandpaper-grits-for-sanding-wood-wood-sanding/cards/facebook/best-sandpaper-grits-for-sanding-wood-wood-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/22/best-sandpaper-grits-for-sanding-wood-wood-sanding/cards/facebook/best-sandpaper-grits-for-sanding-wood-wood-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/22/best-sandpaper-grits-for-sanding-wood-wood-sanding/cards/instagram/best-sandpaper-grits-for-sanding-wood-wood-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/22/best-sandpaper-grits-for-sanding-wood-wood-sanding/cards/instagram/best-sandpaper-grits-for-sanding-wood-wood-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/22/best-sandpaper-grits-for-sanding-wood-wood-sanding/cards/instagram/best-sandpaper-grits-for-sanding-wood-wood-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/22/best-sandpaper-grits-for-sanding-wood-wood-sanding/cards/pinterest/best-sandpaper-grits-for-sanding-wood-wood-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/22/best-sandpaper-grits-for-sanding-wood-wood-sanding/cards/pinterest/best-sandpaper-grits-for-sanding-wood-wood-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/22/best-sandpaper-grits-for-sanding-wood-wood-sanding/cards/pinterest/best-sandpaper-grits-for-sanding-wood-wood-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/22/best-sandpaper-grits-for-sanding-wood-wood-sanding/cards/facebook/best-sandpaper-grits-for-sanding-wood-wood-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/22/best-sandpaper-grits-for-sanding-wood-wood-sanding/cards/facebook/best-sandpaper-grits-for-sanding-wood-wood-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/22/best-sandpaper-grits-for-sanding-wood-wood-sanding/cards/facebook/best-sandpaper-grits-for-sanding-wood-wood-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Price Versus Performance Over Time</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 20 Dec 2025 14:25:50 +0000</pubDate><category>Brand &amp; Quality Comparison</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><description>A technical guide to selecting the best sandpaper brand for long-term value—cut rate, lifespan, surface quality, and workflow efficiency.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="choosing-the-best-sandpaper-brand-for-long-term-value"&gt;Choosing the best sandpaper brand for long-term value&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning, the shop is quiet except for the steady whirr of a 5-inch random-orbit sander. You watch the dust plume flatten as the extractor spools up, then feel the pad settle onto a maple panel you’ve jointed and planed true. The first passes feel crisp—rapid cut, clean scratch pattern, no chatter. Then the feedback shifts. Heat creeps in. The pad skates slightly, cutting less and loading more. You flip the disc, glance at the resin smear, and do the quick math we all do when we care about price versus performance over time: how many panels per disc, and what did it actually cost to get this surface ready for finish? This is why the question of the best sandpaper brand is never just about brand—it’s about measurable throughput, surface quality, and the total cost of consistency.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/14.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/facebook/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/facebook/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/facebook/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/instagram/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/instagram/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/instagram/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/pinterest/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/pinterest/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/pinterest/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/facebook/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/facebook/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/20/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand/cards/facebook/price-versus-performance-over-time-best-sandpaper-brand.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Film Versus Paper Backing With Grains</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 17:25:57 +0000</pubDate><category>Abrasive Materials &amp; Compounds</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><description>Film vs paper sandpaper backings explained with grain choices like silicon carbide, plus pro tips for wet/dry sanding and flawless finishes.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="film-vs-paper-backing-with-silicon-carbide-sandpaper"&gt;Film vs Paper Backing with Silicon Carbide Sandpaper&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday mornings in the shop start the same for me: kettle on, soft sun across the bench, and a project at that satisfying almost-there stage. I’d been chasing a glass-flat finish on a walnut desk with an epoxy river, and the last pass was fighting me—tiny swirls that only showed in raking light. I’d been sanding wet to keep dust down, but the paper kept going mushy at the edges. That’s when I swapped in film-backed silicon carbide sandpaper I’d stashed for auto body work. The difference was immediate: the sheet kept its shape, water beaded and carried the swarf away, and the scratch pattern evened out in a few clean passes. The surface went quiet—no chatter, just controlled cutting.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/10.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/instagram/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/instagram/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/instagram/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/film-versus-paper-backing-with-grains-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Edge Control Around Hardware And Seams</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 13:38:27 +0000</pubDate><category>Marine Sanding</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-280</category><category>grit-320</category><description>Advanced boat sanding techniques for edge control around hardware and seams, from abrasives and pads to workflows that protect profiles and finish quality.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="boat-sanding-mastery-edges-hardware-seams"&gt;Boat sanding mastery: edges, hardware, seams&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dock still smells of salt and diesel when you pull the cover back at first light. The hull prints the sunrise in dull reflections, beautiful from afar but cruel up close—pigtails, flat spots, and a halo of scuffs around the stanchion bases where an impatient hand once grazed the gelcoat. Today is about restraint as much as cutting power. Boat sanding isn’t hard in principle; it’s hard because boats are a collage of edges, radii, seams, and fasteners that punish every lapse in control. A random orbital can fair a panel in minutes, then choke at a cleat, overcut a toe rail, or trench a seam if you don’t recalibrate your technique and consumables for the geometry in front of you.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/06.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding/cards/instagram/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding/cards/instagram/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding/cards/instagram/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding/cards/pinterest/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding/cards/pinterest/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding/cards/pinterest/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/edge-control-around-hardware-and-seams-boat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Keep Heat Low To Prevent Softening</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 17 Dec 2025 14:27:08 +0000</pubDate><category>Plastic &amp; Epoxy Sanding</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>wet sanding</category><description>Engineer-tested guide to epoxy sanding without softening.

&lt;p&gt;The room is quiet except for the soft whirr of a 5-inch random orbital sander. You’ve invested hours pouring a resin river through a slab of maple, watched the swirl of pigment lock under crystal clarity, and now you’re finally leveling the surface for that glass-smooth finish. Then it happens—under the pad, the epoxy feels different. The sander drags, the dust turns to smeary ribbons, and the finish dulls into a gummy haze. If you’ve experienced that sinking feeling, you’ve already met the enemy of precision finishing: heat buildup.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/29.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding/cards/instagram/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding/cards/instagram/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding/cards/instagram/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding/cards/pinterest/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding/cards/pinterest/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding/cards/pinterest/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/keep-heat-low-to-prevent-softening-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Pressure And Speed Settings For Ceramics</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/16/pressure-and-speed-settings-for-ceramics-ceramic-sanding-discs/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/16/pressure-and-speed-settings-for-ceramics-ceramic-sanding-discs/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 13:44:59 +0000</pubDate><category>Ceramic &amp; Premium Abrasives</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-320</category><category>dust control</category><category>wet sanding</category><description>Learn pro-level pressure and speed settings for ceramics using ceramic sanding discs, with step-by-step methods, tips, and troubleshooting.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="ceramic-sanding-discs-pressure-and-speed-guide"&gt;Ceramic Sanding Discs: Pressure and Speed Guide&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Late Saturday, the shop was warm and humming when a customer walked in with a chipped porcelain threshold. “One wrong pass,” he sighed, pointing at the glossy edge that now had a small bite missing. I recognized it immediately: too much speed, too much pressure, and a disc that glazed over before it could cut clean. I’ve been there—on driftwood, on aluminum, and yes, on ceramic tile where heat and hard grains make every mistake loud and permanent. That’s why pressure and speed matter more with ceramics than almost any other material. Ceramic is unforgiving. The wrong setting with ceramic sanding discs can burnish instead of cut, spike temperatures, and cause micro-cracking or edge blowouts you won’t see until the grout goes in.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/23.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/16/pressure-and-speed-settings-for-ceramics-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/pressure-and-speed-settings-for-ceramics-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/16/pressure-and-speed-settings-for-ceramics-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/pressure-and-speed-settings-for-ceramics-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/16/pressure-and-speed-settings-for-ceramics-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/pressure-and-speed-settings-for-ceramics-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/16/pressure-and-speed-settings-for-ceramics-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/pressure-and-speed-settings-for-ceramics-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/16/pressure-and-speed-settings-for-ceramics-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/pressure-and-speed-settings-for-ceramics-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/16/pressure-and-speed-settings-for-ceramics-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/pressure-and-speed-settings-for-ceramics-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/16/pressure-and-speed-settings-for-ceramics-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/pressure-and-speed-settings-for-ceramics-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/16/pressure-and-speed-settings-for-ceramics-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/pressure-and-speed-settings-for-ceramics-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/16/pressure-and-speed-settings-for-ceramics-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/pressure-and-speed-settings-for-ceramics-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/16/pressure-and-speed-settings-for-ceramics-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/pressure-and-speed-settings-for-ceramics-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/16/pressure-and-speed-settings-for-ceramics-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/pressure-and-speed-settings-for-ceramics-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/16/pressure-and-speed-settings-for-ceramics-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/pressure-and-speed-settings-for-ceramics-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>When To Drop Back A Grit To Fix Defects</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/15/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/15/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 15 Dec 2025 13:46:21 +0000</pubDate><category>Grit Range &amp; Classification</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><description>Practical rules and tests to know when to drop back sandpaper grit to remove defects without over-sanding, from wood and resin to automotive clear coat.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="when-to-drop-back-sandpaper-grit-to-fix-defects"&gt;When to Drop Back Sandpaper Grit to Fix Defects&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning. Coffee cooling on the bench, raking light cutting across your project like a truth serum. You wanted a quick scuff-and-recoat—thirty minutes, tops. Instead, the panel keeps whispering back at you: that line near the edge, the mysterious dull patch that won’t clear, the faint spiral that appears only at a certain angle. You switch sheets, then pressure, then motion, but the micro-scratches stubbornly telegraph through. It’s the universal moment where your patience meets physics: do you keep climbing up the sequence or drop back a sandpaper grit to reset the scratch pattern?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/21.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/15/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/15/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/15/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/15/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit/cards/instagram/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/15/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit/cards/instagram/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/15/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit/cards/instagram/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/15/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit/cards/pinterest/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/15/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit/cards/pinterest/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/15/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit/cards/pinterest/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/15/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/15/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/15/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/when-to-drop-back-a-grit-to-fix-defects-sandpaper-grit.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Final Grit Selection By Finish Type</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/14/final-grit-selection-by-finish-type-sandpaper-grit-chart/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/14/final-grit-selection-by-finish-type-sandpaper-grit-chart/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 14 Dec 2025 13:33:32 +0000</pubDate><category>Grit Guide &amp; Education</category><category>grit chart</category><category>abrasive standards</category><category>grit progression</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-101</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><description>Clear, expert guidance on final grit selection by finish type.

&lt;p&gt;It’s 8:40 p.m. in a quiet shop, and the last pass of the sander will decide everything. The walnut dresser is leveled, drawer faces are flush, and you’ve already tuned the edges by hand. What remains is the final grit choice—the one that determines whether an oil finish glows with depth, a waterborne polyurethane keys properly, or a lacquer topcoat lays down glass-flat. This is where a sandpaper grit chart becomes more than a table of numbers; it’s a translation key between surface profile, abrasive behavior, and finish chemistry. Choose carelessly and you’ll fight adhesion problems, washed-out figure, or telegraphed swirl marks. Choose well and the finish rewards you with clarity, durability, and speed.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/19.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/14/final-grit-selection-by-finish-type-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/final-grit-selection-by-finish-type-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/14/final-grit-selection-by-finish-type-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/final-grit-selection-by-finish-type-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/14/final-grit-selection-by-finish-type-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/final-grit-selection-by-finish-type-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/14/final-grit-selection-by-finish-type-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/instagram/final-grit-selection-by-finish-type-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/14/final-grit-selection-by-finish-type-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/instagram/final-grit-selection-by-finish-type-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/14/final-grit-selection-by-finish-type-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/instagram/final-grit-selection-by-finish-type-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/14/final-grit-selection-by-finish-type-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/pinterest/final-grit-selection-by-finish-type-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/14/final-grit-selection-by-finish-type-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/pinterest/final-grit-selection-by-finish-type-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/14/final-grit-selection-by-finish-type-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/pinterest/final-grit-selection-by-finish-type-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/14/final-grit-selection-by-finish-type-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/final-grit-selection-by-finish-type-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/14/final-grit-selection-by-finish-type-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/final-grit-selection-by-finish-type-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/14/final-grit-selection-by-finish-type-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/final-grit-selection-by-finish-type-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Use Bag Plus Hepa Filter For Drywall Dust</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/13/use-bag-plus-hepa-filter-for-drywall-dust-dustless-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/13/use-bag-plus-hepa-filter-for-drywall-dust-dustless-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 13 Dec 2025 13:32:51 +0000</pubDate><category>Dust Extraction Systems</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-320</category><description>Learn how to pair a HEPA bag and filter for dustless sanding, keeping drywall dust under control with cleaner air, faster cleanup, and pro-grade results.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="dustless-sanding-with-hepa-bags-for-drywall-dust"&gt;Dustless sanding with HEPA bags for drywall dust&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first time you sand fresh drywall, you learn how sneaky the dust can be. It drifts like fog—settling in coffee cups, clinging to jackets by the door, finding its way into rooms you never even entered. A weekend project becomes a week of wiping, vacuuming, and still catching a powdery haze in the afternoon sun. If you’re living in the space you’re renovating, the frustration is double: family life doesn’t pause while you sand. That’s why the right setup—pairing a vacuum bag with a true HEPA filter and a sander built for dustless sanding—changes everything. It’s not just cleaner; it’s calmer. You notice the shift the first time you turn off the sander and the air looks the same as it did before you started.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/17.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/13/use-bag-plus-hepa-filter-for-drywall-dust-dustless-sanding/cards/facebook/use-bag-plus-hepa-filter-for-drywall-dust-dustless-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/13/use-bag-plus-hepa-filter-for-drywall-dust-dustless-sanding/cards/facebook/use-bag-plus-hepa-filter-for-drywall-dust-dustless-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/13/use-bag-plus-hepa-filter-for-drywall-dust-dustless-sanding/cards/facebook/use-bag-plus-hepa-filter-for-drywall-dust-dustless-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/13/use-bag-plus-hepa-filter-for-drywall-dust-dustless-sanding/cards/instagram/use-bag-plus-hepa-filter-for-drywall-dust-dustless-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/13/use-bag-plus-hepa-filter-for-drywall-dust-dustless-sanding/cards/instagram/use-bag-plus-hepa-filter-for-drywall-dust-dustless-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/13/use-bag-plus-hepa-filter-for-drywall-dust-dustless-sanding/cards/instagram/use-bag-plus-hepa-filter-for-drywall-dust-dustless-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/13/use-bag-plus-hepa-filter-for-drywall-dust-dustless-sanding/cards/pinterest/use-bag-plus-hepa-filter-for-drywall-dust-dustless-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/13/use-bag-plus-hepa-filter-for-drywall-dust-dustless-sanding/cards/pinterest/use-bag-plus-hepa-filter-for-drywall-dust-dustless-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/13/use-bag-plus-hepa-filter-for-drywall-dust-dustless-sanding/cards/pinterest/use-bag-plus-hepa-filter-for-drywall-dust-dustless-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/13/use-bag-plus-hepa-filter-for-drywall-dust-dustless-sanding/cards/facebook/use-bag-plus-hepa-filter-for-drywall-dust-dustless-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/13/use-bag-plus-hepa-filter-for-drywall-dust-dustless-sanding/cards/facebook/use-bag-plus-hepa-filter-for-drywall-dust-dustless-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/13/use-bag-plus-hepa-filter-for-drywall-dust-dustless-sanding/cards/facebook/use-bag-plus-hepa-filter-for-drywall-dust-dustless-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Best Grits For Leveling Primer</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 12 Dec 2025 14:45:24 +0000</pubDate><category>PSA Discs</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-500</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>clear coat</category><category>wet sanding</category><description>Engineer-tested guide to the best grits for leveling primer.

&lt;p&gt;Saturday mornings in my garage start with coffee, a quiet radio, and a panel that still holds a map of yesterday’s imperfections. The primer is flat gray, but under a raking light you can read it like topography—little ridges around a dent repair, faint peel from a heavy pass, and that one shallow wave you only see when you step back. I’ve learned that this is where the paint job is actually won or lost, not in the clear coat. And the tools matter: the block, the sander orbit, the mineral in the abrasive, even the adhesive that bonds the disc. When I swapped to psa sanding discs on a rigid interface for the first “leveling” cut, I noticed two things right away—straighter panels and fewer surprises after sealer.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/13.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Tack Cloth And Vacuum Steps After Scuff Sanding</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 17:33:26 +0000</pubDate><category>Between-Coats Sanding</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>dust control</category><category>clear coat</category><description>Engineer-tested steps for between coats sanding: how to vacuum, tack, and scuff for flawless finishes without dust nibs or witness lines.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="between-coats-sanding-with-tack-cloth-and-vacuum"&gt;Between Coats Sanding with Tack Cloth and Vacuum&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first time I cared about finish quality was on a cold Saturday, kneeling on a drop cloth, cradling a cabinet door that looked perfect—until light from the window slid across it. That raking beam turned gentle amber into a topography of dust nibs, witness lines, and a faint, scratchy haze. I’d rushed the cleaning between scuff passes and relied on a single wipe with an old T‑shirt. The result was predictable in hindsight: dust trapped in clear coat, uneven adhesion, and a finish that only looked good under dim light. That afternoon I learned what every disciplined finisher knows: between coats sanding isn’t about aggression—it’s about control.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/26.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding/cards/instagram/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding/cards/instagram/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding/cards/instagram/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding/cards/pinterest/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding/cards/pinterest/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding/cards/pinterest/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/tack-cloth-and-vacuum-steps-after-scuff-sanding-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Apply Dry Guide Coat Evenly Over Primer Before Blocking</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2025 13:40:28 +0000</pubDate><category>Auto Body Sanding</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-500</category><category>grit-600</category><category>dust control</category><description>Learn how to apply a dry guide coat evenly over primer and block panels with precision.

&lt;p&gt;The shop is quiet except for the hiss of air through a regulator and the faint tick of cooling metal. You’ve just laid down a uniform film of high-build primer on a long quarter panel, the kind with a subtle crown that punishes any lapse in technique. Under raking LEDs, the surface looks good—flat at a glance, gray and matte like it should. But you know better. Until you perform disciplined guide coat sanding, there’s no honest way to read the surface. The panel has its history: tap-down marks from the last round of metalwork, a skim of filler you were careful not to overshape, and a featheredge that transitions into OEM finish along the dogleg. If any area is slightly low, the topcoat will amplify it like a megaphone.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/16.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding/cards/facebook/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding/cards/facebook/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding/cards/facebook/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding/cards/instagram/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding/cards/instagram/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding/cards/instagram/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding/cards/pinterest/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding/cards/pinterest/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding/cards/pinterest/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding/cards/facebook/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding/cards/facebook/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/08/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding/cards/facebook/apply-dry-guide-coat-evenly-over-primer-before-blocking-guide-coat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>13</readingTime></item><item><title>Best Sanding Sponge Grit For Trim Surface Prep</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 07 Dec 2025 15:12:05 +0000</pubDate><category>Trim &amp; Molding Sanding</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-280</category><category>grit-320</category><category>dry sanding</category><category>sanding block</category><category>dust control</category><description>Engineer-tested guide to pick the best sponge for trim, from grit selection to technique, for flawless adhesion and smooth paint on wood and MDF.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="best-sponge-for-trim-sanding-grits-that-last"&gt;Best sponge for trim: sanding grits that last&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning light spilled across the hallway, revealing every chip and ridge along the baseboards that I’d stopped seeing months ago. The kind of small defects you only notice when you decide to fix them. I laid out the drop cloths and opened the can of trim enamel, mentally penciling in a half-day project. Then I reached for a sponge for trim instead of paper. That choice seems small, but it’s the difference between a paint job that looks good today and one that still looks good next year. As an engineer, I’ve learned that coatings fail at interfaces, not in the middle of the film. And the interface—the mechanical “tooth” you cut into the substrate—comes from your abrasives.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/10.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim/cards/facebook/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim/cards/facebook/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim/cards/facebook/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim/cards/instagram/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim/cards/instagram/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim/cards/instagram/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim/cards/pinterest/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim/cards/pinterest/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim/cards/pinterest/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim/cards/facebook/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim/cards/facebook/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim/cards/facebook/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Wrap Sandpaper Around Dowels For Curved Edges</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 05 Dec 2025 13:37:54 +0000</pubDate><category>Hand Sanding Techniques</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Practical guide to hand sanding curved edges by wrapping sandpaper around dowels; testing abrasives, grits, and jigs for consistent radii.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="hand-sanding-curves-wrap-paper-around-dowels"&gt;Hand Sanding Curves: Wrap Paper Around Dowels&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember the first time a curve made me question my craft. It was a walnut keepsake box with a lid that looked perfect on CAD: a soft 10 mm radius running cleanly along all four edges. On the bench, though, the radius fought back. My block sander flattened the apex, my random-orbit sander skated off the edge, and every “shortcut” I tried left flats and chatter marks that showed up under finish like neon. I finally reached for the simplest tool in the shop: a hardwood dowel, a strip of abrasive, and my hands. With careful hand sanding—wrapping the paper around a dowel that matched the profile—the radius began to read as a continuous curve instead of a sequence of mistakes. The tactile feedback told me where the high spots were; the scratch pattern told me when I was pushing too hard.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/02.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding/cards/instagram/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding/cards/instagram/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding/cards/instagram/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding/cards/pinterest/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding/cards/pinterest/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding/cards/pinterest/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Reusable Sponges To Reduce Waste</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 17:37:43 +0000</pubDate><category>Eco &amp; Non-Toxic Abrasives</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>dry sanding</category><category>paint prep</category><category>dust control</category><category>joint compound</category><description>Expert guide to eco sandpaper and reusable sponges: prep, grit strategy, cleaning cycles, and workflows that reduce waste without compromising finish.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="eco-sandpaper-and-reusable-sanding-sponges"&gt;Eco sandpaper and reusable sanding sponges&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a Saturday morning, I stood over a maple desk that had seen too many years of coffee rings and hurried notes. The sun cut across the shop floor, catching dust motes suspended in a quiet orbit around the project that would—if I did this right—become an heirloom. Next to me sat a half-empty box of worn paper sheets and a small pile of discarded grits I’d promised myself I’d send to recycling (a promise I rarely kept). It felt familiar and a little defeating: endless sheets, clogged in minutes, and a small mountain of waste. That was the morning I switched the workflow, integrating reusable sanding sponges and eco sandpaper into a process designed not just for finish quality, but for sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/29.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper/cards/instagram/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper/cards/instagram/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper/cards/instagram/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/reusable-sponges-to-reduce-waste-eco-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Open Coat Versus Closed Coat Impacts</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 13:41:49 +0000</pubDate><category>Abrasive Materials &amp; Compounds</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-1200</category><description>Open vs closed coat sanding explained with lab-tested data.

&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning in the shop is supposed to be simple: one mug of coffee, a walnut desktop to final-sand, and a couple of hours of quiet before the house wakes up. Instead, at pass number fifteen, the paper glazes over. The dust lines smear into the grain, and the sander’s pitch changes—a small but telling protest. I switch sheets, still chasing that consistent, haze-free scratch pattern. When I move to wet-sand a lacquer test panel, silicon carbide sandpaper comes out of the drawer—its black grit and smooth backing a distinct contrast to the tan aluminum oxide I’ve used on the walnut. Ten minutes later, I’m flattening a glued-up end-grain cutting board, then stepping over to clean up a steel plane body. Same sander, same operator, but suddenly my results diverge depending on one detail I often overlook: how densely the abrasive grains were packed onto the paper in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/23.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/instagram/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/instagram/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/instagram/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/04/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/open-coat-versus-closed-coat-impacts-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Smooth Fairing Compound Before Primer</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/02/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/02/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 02 Dec 2025 13:43:25 +0000</pubDate><category>Marine Sanding</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>dry sanding</category><category>primer coat</category><description>Master boat sanding and fairing for a glass-smooth base before primer.

&lt;p&gt;You can hear it before you see it: the soft rasp of paper across gelcoat, the shush-shush rhythm that turns a scuffed hull into something you can be proud of. Boat sanding isn’t exactly glamorous, but on a still morning—coffee perched on a dock post, gulls trading gossip overhead—it feels like craft. Your fingers become the first inspectors, gliding across highs and lows. The goal isn’t just clean; it’s consistent. When you’re aiming for smooth fairing compound before primer, you’re making a commitment to what comes next: paint that lays down like glass, reflections that don’t ripple, and time on the water that starts sooner because you did the prep right.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/19.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/02/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/02/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/02/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/02/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding/cards/instagram/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/02/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding/cards/instagram/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/02/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding/cards/instagram/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/02/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding/cards/pinterest/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/02/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding/cards/pinterest/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/02/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding/cards/pinterest/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/02/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/02/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/02/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>When To Choose Trizact Style Abrasives</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 01 Dec 2025 13:40:34 +0000</pubDate><category>Specialty Abrasives</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Learn when to choose Trizact style abrasives vs microfinishing film.

&lt;p&gt;The shop is quiet in the way only focused work can create—overhead lights humming, a small radio whispering in the corner, and the soft, steady rasp of a belt skimming steel. You’ve shaped a kitchen knife from bar stock, or maybe you’re prepping a classic car panel after welding in a patch. The hard work is done, but the finish is still miles away from what you picture: clean, even, and confident. You swap belts, try a different disc, lighten pressure, and still those stubborn lines hang on. Do you step to a more aggressive grit? Switch to a finer one? Or change the abrasive altogether?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/11.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film/cards/instagram/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film/cards/instagram/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film/cards/instagram/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film/cards/pinterest/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film/cards/pinterest/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film/cards/pinterest/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-trizact-style-abrasives-microfinishing-film.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Wrap Sandpaper Correctly On A Block</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 14:51:04 +0000</pubDate><category>Sanding Blocks</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>sanding block</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>dry sanding</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Learn how to wrap sandpaper on a sanding block for flat, fast, scratch-free results.

&lt;p&gt;I still remember the first shelf I built for our entryway—a simple maple plank resting on two brackets, meant to hold keys and a couple of planters. The board came out of the planer with faint ripples; the chamfers were uneven; and the finish looked decent from six feet away but not when the morning light hit. I did what many DIYers do: grabbed a sheet of paper, wrapped it around a block haphazardly, and pushed until my fingers ached. The final surface was smooth-ish, but I had shallow waves and rounded corners that betrayed the lack of control. Only after I switched to a properly wrapped sanding block did the maple flatten, the scratch pattern tighten, and my edges stay crisp.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/20.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block/cards/facebook/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block/cards/facebook/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block/cards/facebook/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block/cards/instagram/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block/cards/instagram/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block/cards/instagram/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block/cards/facebook/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block/cards/facebook/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block/cards/facebook/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>13</readingTime></item><item><title>Best Interface Pad For Curved Surfaces</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 18:06:15 +0000</pubDate><category>Random Orbital Sanding</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>Learn how to choose the best interface pad for curved surfaces and master random orbital sanding for cleaner contours, fewer swirls, and better control.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="best-interface-pads-for-curves-in-random-orbital-sanding"&gt;Best Interface Pads for Curves in Random Orbital Sanding&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You notice it the moment you run your hand across a curved armrest you’ve just sanded: the shape is smoother, yet somehow flatter than you hoped. The ridge that gave the piece personality has softened a little too much; the transition from convex to concave feels vague. You step back, eyes scanning for the culprit, and there it is—tiny half-moons glinting in the light. Swirl marks. Anyone who’s tried to sand a contoured chair leg, a guitar body, a carved cabinet door, or even a rounded countertop edge has felt this mix of pride and frustration. You’ve done the hard work of shaping. Now the surface needs finesse without losing its curves.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/16.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding/cards/instagram/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding/cards/instagram/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding/cards/instagram/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding/cards/pinterest/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding/cards/pinterest/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding/cards/pinterest/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/best-interface-pad-for-curved-surfaces-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Light Sanding To Improve Adhesion Between Coats</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 14:39:05 +0000</pubDate><category>Between-Coats Sanding</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>dust control</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>Engineer’s guide to between coats sanding for stronger adhesion, right grits, abrasives, and timing.

&lt;p&gt;The first coat looked flawless under the shop lights. A fresh panel of maple, sealed in gloss, catching reflections like glass. Then morning sunlight cut through the window and told the truth: a constellation of dust nibs and a few faint brush marks the light had spared me the night before. If you’ve been there, you also know the impulse—grab more finish and try to bury the flaws. That almost always backfires. The next coat telegraphs the defects and, worse, may not bond optimally. That’s where the simple ritual of between coats sanding changes everything, not as a punishment, but as an engineering control.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/12.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding/cards/instagram/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding/cards/instagram/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding/cards/instagram/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding/cards/pinterest/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding/cards/pinterest/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding/cards/pinterest/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/light-sanding-to-improve-adhesion-between-coats-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Block Sanding Techniques To Straighten Wavy Panels</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/block-sanding-techniques-to-straighten-wavy-panels-block-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/block-sanding-techniques-to-straighten-wavy-panels-block-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 22 Nov 2025 00:39:32 +0000</pubDate><category>Auto Body Sanding</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit progression</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>mirror finish</category><description>Master block sanding to straighten wavy panels.

&lt;p&gt;The first time you notice the wave is rarely under shop fluorescents. It’s usually on a quiet evening, when the sun sits low and your freshly primed quarter panel mirrors a rippling skyline instead of a straight horizon. You run a hand over the surface—smooth, no pinholes, no obvious highs—yet the reflection trembles as if it remembers every hammer blow. That’s the moment every builder meets the truth: paint doesn’t hide shape. Only block sanding, done methodically with the right abrasives, pressure, and board geometry, can translate good bodywork into panels that read as laser-straight in unforgiving light.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/02.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/block-sanding-techniques-to-straighten-wavy-panels-block-sanding/cards/facebook/block-sanding-techniques-to-straighten-wavy-panels-block-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/block-sanding-techniques-to-straighten-wavy-panels-block-sanding/cards/facebook/block-sanding-techniques-to-straighten-wavy-panels-block-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/block-sanding-techniques-to-straighten-wavy-panels-block-sanding/cards/facebook/block-sanding-techniques-to-straighten-wavy-panels-block-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/block-sanding-techniques-to-straighten-wavy-panels-block-sanding/cards/instagram/block-sanding-techniques-to-straighten-wavy-panels-block-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/block-sanding-techniques-to-straighten-wavy-panels-block-sanding/cards/instagram/block-sanding-techniques-to-straighten-wavy-panels-block-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/block-sanding-techniques-to-straighten-wavy-panels-block-sanding/cards/instagram/block-sanding-techniques-to-straighten-wavy-panels-block-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/block-sanding-techniques-to-straighten-wavy-panels-block-sanding/cards/pinterest/block-sanding-techniques-to-straighten-wavy-panels-block-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/block-sanding-techniques-to-straighten-wavy-panels-block-sanding/cards/pinterest/block-sanding-techniques-to-straighten-wavy-panels-block-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/block-sanding-techniques-to-straighten-wavy-panels-block-sanding/cards/pinterest/block-sanding-techniques-to-straighten-wavy-panels-block-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/block-sanding-techniques-to-straighten-wavy-panels-block-sanding/cards/facebook/block-sanding-techniques-to-straighten-wavy-panels-block-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/block-sanding-techniques-to-straighten-wavy-panels-block-sanding/cards/facebook/block-sanding-techniques-to-straighten-wavy-panels-block-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/block-sanding-techniques-to-straighten-wavy-panels-block-sanding/cards/facebook/block-sanding-techniques-to-straighten-wavy-panels-block-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>How To Sand Detailed Trim Profiles Without Rounding Over</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 21 Nov 2025 14:57:21 +0000</pubDate><category>Trim &amp; Molding Sanding</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>dust control</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Engineer-tested methods for profile sanding detailed trim without rounding edges.

&lt;p&gt;A Saturday morning, coffee cooling on the bench, I’m staring at a stretch of 1920s casing that’s seen one too many paint jobs and a hard century of sun. The ogee still reads elegant from across the room, but up close the quirk line is softened and the fillet is barely a suggestion. I know the story because I’ve helped write versions of it: strip, sand, repaint — and somehow every pass with paper steals the edges that make the molding sing. The fear of rounding is why many pros dread profile sanding. It’s not the effort; it’s the risk of flattening crisp geometry that took a knife or cutter just seconds to define.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/25.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding/cards/instagram/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding/cards/instagram/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding/cards/instagram/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>How To Apply Grain Filler On Open Pore Woods Like Oak</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 21 Nov 2025 13:33:23 +0000</pubDate><category>Furniture Refinishing</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>orbital sander</category><description>Learn precise grain filling for oak: abrasives, sanding workflow, filler selection, and application to achieve a glass-smooth finish on open-pore woods.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="grain-filling-oak-pro-sanding-and-filler-workflow"&gt;Grain Filling Oak: Pro Sanding and Filler Workflow&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a moment every woodworker recognizes: fingertips tracing a new oak tabletop, catching on the earlywood valleys that step across the surface like tiny terraces. Under shop lights, the finish looks glossy, almost perfect—until the raking light at sunrise reveals a topography of pores telegraphing through the film. That’s when grain filling stops being a nice-to-have and becomes a requirement. On open-pore woods like oak, ash, and mahogany, achieving a piano-flat finish asks for a deliberate sequence: correct abrasive selection, controlled scratch management, filler chemistry that matches your topcoat, and disciplined leveling. Skip any step and the pores will betray your shortcuts weeks later.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/23.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling/cards/facebook/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling/cards/facebook/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling/cards/facebook/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling/cards/instagram/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling/cards/instagram/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling/cards/instagram/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling/cards/pinterest/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling/cards/pinterest/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling/cards/pinterest/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling/cards/facebook/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling/cards/facebook/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling/cards/facebook/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Hand Sanding Versus Power Sanding Comparison</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/hand-sanding-versus-power-sanding-comparison-hand-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/hand-sanding-versus-power-sanding-comparison-hand-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2025 16:50:43 +0000</pubDate><category>Hand Sanding Techniques</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Engineer’s comparison of hand sanding and power sanding: surface finish, speed, dust, cost, and workflow tips for wood, metal, and paint.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="hand-sanding-vs-power-sanding-an-engineers-guide"&gt;Hand sanding vs power sanding: an engineer’s guide&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a point in every restoration or build where the project stops looking like a collection of parts and starts feeling like an object with a future. For me, it’s the first moment the surface turns uniformly matte under the light. That’s usually after the first disciplined pass of hand sanding. The radio is low, dust extraction hums in the background, and the world reduces to the consistent rhythm of the block. Compare that to the blunt urgency of a random-orbit sander—faster, louder, and undeniably effective. Both have their place. When you’re staring at a hardwood tabletop with coffee rings and cross-grain scratches, or a steel bracket that needs a satin finish without rounding its crisp edges, the choice between manual strokes and powered oscillations is more than preference; it’s a process decision that dictates speed, quality, and cost.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/17.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/hand-sanding-versus-power-sanding-comparison-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/hand-sanding-versus-power-sanding-comparison-hand-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/hand-sanding-versus-power-sanding-comparison-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/hand-sanding-versus-power-sanding-comparison-hand-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/hand-sanding-versus-power-sanding-comparison-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/hand-sanding-versus-power-sanding-comparison-hand-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/hand-sanding-versus-power-sanding-comparison-hand-sanding/cards/instagram/hand-sanding-versus-power-sanding-comparison-hand-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/hand-sanding-versus-power-sanding-comparison-hand-sanding/cards/instagram/hand-sanding-versus-power-sanding-comparison-hand-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/hand-sanding-versus-power-sanding-comparison-hand-sanding/cards/instagram/hand-sanding-versus-power-sanding-comparison-hand-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/hand-sanding-versus-power-sanding-comparison-hand-sanding/cards/pinterest/hand-sanding-versus-power-sanding-comparison-hand-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/hand-sanding-versus-power-sanding-comparison-hand-sanding/cards/pinterest/hand-sanding-versus-power-sanding-comparison-hand-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/hand-sanding-versus-power-sanding-comparison-hand-sanding/cards/pinterest/hand-sanding-versus-power-sanding-comparison-hand-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/hand-sanding-versus-power-sanding-comparison-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/hand-sanding-versus-power-sanding-comparison-hand-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/hand-sanding-versus-power-sanding-comparison-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/hand-sanding-versus-power-sanding-comparison-hand-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/hand-sanding-versus-power-sanding-comparison-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/hand-sanding-versus-power-sanding-comparison-hand-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Hepa Extraction And Respirator Guidance</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/hepa-extraction-and-respirator-guidance-eco-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/hepa-extraction-and-respirator-guidance-eco-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2025 15:29:07 +0000</pubDate><category>Eco &amp; Non-Toxic Abrasives</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Practical HEPA extraction and respirator guidance for sanding workflows, with eco sandpaper selection, fit testing, and lead-safe cleanup best practices.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="hepa-extraction-and-respirators-with-eco-sandpaper"&gt;HEPA Extraction and Respirators with eco sandpaper&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you spend your days refining surfaces, you know the moment: the room is quiet except for the steady hum of the sander, extraction hose draped over your shoulder, and the clean, consistent bite of the abrasive cutting only what it needs to. It’s a small sense of control in a messy world—measured in microns and minutes saved. The work is exacting and sometimes unforgiving, especially when the substrate is unknown or the coating dates back decades. That’s why the right system matters. From the abrasive itself—perhaps an eco sandpaper that reduces loading and waste—to the HEPA extractor and the respirator on your face, every component either drives precision or introduces risk.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/15.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/hepa-extraction-and-respirator-guidance-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/hepa-extraction-and-respirator-guidance-eco-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/hepa-extraction-and-respirator-guidance-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/hepa-extraction-and-respirator-guidance-eco-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/hepa-extraction-and-respirator-guidance-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/hepa-extraction-and-respirator-guidance-eco-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/hepa-extraction-and-respirator-guidance-eco-sandpaper/cards/instagram/hepa-extraction-and-respirator-guidance-eco-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/hepa-extraction-and-respirator-guidance-eco-sandpaper/cards/instagram/hepa-extraction-and-respirator-guidance-eco-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/hepa-extraction-and-respirator-guidance-eco-sandpaper/cards/instagram/hepa-extraction-and-respirator-guidance-eco-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/hepa-extraction-and-respirator-guidance-eco-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/hepa-extraction-and-respirator-guidance-eco-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/hepa-extraction-and-respirator-guidance-eco-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/hepa-extraction-and-respirator-guidance-eco-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/hepa-extraction-and-respirator-guidance-eco-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/hepa-extraction-and-respirator-guidance-eco-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/hepa-extraction-and-respirator-guidance-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/hepa-extraction-and-respirator-guidance-eco-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/hepa-extraction-and-respirator-guidance-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/hepa-extraction-and-respirator-guidance-eco-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/hepa-extraction-and-respirator-guidance-eco-sandpaper/cards/facebook/hepa-extraction-and-respirator-guidance-eco-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Keep Surfaces Wet To Control Heat</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2025 13:37:28 +0000</pubDate><category>Glass &amp; Ceramics Sanding</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-280</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-1200</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>Learn expert glass sanding techniques—why water matters, how to control heat, avoid cracks, and get a flawless edge with safe, practical workshop setups.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="glass-sanding-keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat"&gt;Glass Sanding: Keep Surfaces Wet to Control Heat&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know that afternoon light that hits your workshop just right—sawdust floating like golden confetti, the radio low, a mug ring etched into the bench? That’s where precision starts for me. I remember the first time I tried to smooth a chipped glass shelf salvaged from a vintage cabinet. I treated it like hardwood: dry paper, firm pressure, and a “let’s get this done” pace. Ten minutes in, the edge flashed white, my pad squealed, and the glass pinged with that terrifying, crystalline chatter. I learned fast: glass doesn’t forgive heat. It stores stress the way steel stores spring.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/03.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding/cards/instagram/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding/cards/instagram/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding/cards/instagram/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding/cards/pinterest/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding/cards/pinterest/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding/cards/pinterest/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Start Grit For Leveling High Spots</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/17/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/17/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 17 Nov 2025 15:18:37 +0000</pubDate><category>Plastic &amp; Epoxy Sanding</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-280</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><description>Learn the ideal start grit to level epoxy high spots, avoid clogging, and build a clean sanding workflow for flat, finish-ready surfaces.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="epoxy-sanding-best-start-grit-for-high-spots"&gt;Epoxy sanding: best start grit for high spots&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first pass tells the whole story. You stand over a curing project—maybe a kayak hull, a countertop, or a floor section—with yesterday’s resin gone glassy and a few unkind ridges catching the raking light. Your hand slides across the surface and pauses on a drip, a seam, a ripple that won’t disappear by wishful thinking. You can hear the random orbital sander on the bench before you touch it. The only decision that matters now: what grit to start with. Get it wrong and you burn time, discs, and patience. Get it right and the surface flatness comes quickly, scratches stack predictably, and the finish you planned is still in reach. I’ve spent years chasing that first cut—especially during epoxy sanding—because the first cut sets your entire workflow’s cost, heat load, and scratch management.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/28.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/17/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/17/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/17/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/17/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding/cards/instagram/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/17/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding/cards/instagram/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/17/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding/cards/instagram/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/17/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding/cards/pinterest/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/17/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding/cards/pinterest/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/17/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding/cards/pinterest/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/17/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/17/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/17/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Step Down Rules To Erase Deep Scratches</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 15 Nov 2025 16:51:30 +0000</pubDate><category>Grit Range &amp; Classification</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><description>Pro techniques for stepping down sandpaper grit to erase deep scratches on wood, metal, and plastic with precise workflows and abrasive selection.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="mastering-sandpaper-grit-for-deep-scratch-removal"&gt;Mastering sandpaper grit for deep scratch removal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first pass felt promising. Under the raking light, your tabletop—once scored by a moving box staple—looked flatter after a few steady minutes with the sander. But as you wipe the dust and the surface flashes under a shop lamp, new lines appear, marching in a tidy, parallel pattern. You didn’t make the damage worse; you simply revealed the truth. Deep scratches are not single defects; they’re profiles with depth, flanks, and torn fibers or gouged metal. Managing that geometry is why sandpaper grit selection and step-down discipline matter as much as the tool in hand.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/20.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit/cards/instagram/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit/cards/instagram/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit/cards/instagram/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit/cards/pinterest/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit/cards/pinterest/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit/cards/pinterest/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit/cards/facebook/step-down-rules-to-erase-deep-scratches-sandpaper-grit.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Follow Contours With Foam Interface Pads</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 15 Nov 2025 13:28:35 +0000</pubDate><category>Interface Pads &amp; Backing Pads</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>clear coat</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Engineer-tested guide to sander interface pads: foam science, thickness choices, test data, and techniques for flawless curves and edges.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="sander-interface-pad-guide-follow-contours-better"&gt;Sander interface pad guide: follow contours better&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first time I tried to refinish a vintage guitar body with tight belly cuts and arm contours, I did what most of us do: I slapped a fresh disc on my random-orbit sander and went to town. Ten minutes in, the color had evened out, but the edges told a different story—flat spots where the soft curve should have been, and a constellation of pigtails where the disc burped dust across a ridge. I stopped, frustrated. This wasn’t a flat tabletop; this was a compound curve. The tool I had was fighting the surface I wanted. That project is when a mentor handed me a simple piece of foam: a sander interface pad.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/14.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/instagram/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/instagram/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/instagram/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/pinterest/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/pinterest/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/pinterest/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/follow-contours-with-foam-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Scuff Sand Between Coats With A Sponge</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 14 Nov 2025 06:26:49 +0000</pubDate><category>Sanding Sponges</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><description>Engineer-tested guide to scuff sanding between coats using a sanding sponge—grit, pressure, foam chemistry, and pro tips for flawless finishes.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="how-to-scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sanding-sponge"&gt;How to Scuff Sand Between Coats with a Sanding Sponge&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first coat looked perfect under shop lights—glossy, mirror-like, promising. Then morning sunlight cut across the panel and told the truth: a few dust nibs, a faint orange peel near the edge, and the slightest ripple where the grain lifted. I’ve been there more times than I’ll admit. The urge is to lay on more finish and hope it “levels out,” but finishing rarely rewards wishful thinking. What fixes it—quietly, consistently—is a simple pass with a sanding sponge.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/06.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge/cards/instagram/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge/cards/instagram/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge/cards/instagram/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge/cards/pinterest/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge/cards/pinterest/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge/cards/pinterest/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Choose Cork Or Rubber Blocks For Even Pressure</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 16:32:32 +0000</pubDate><category>Sanding Blocks</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>sanding block</category><description>Decide between cork and rubber sanding block for even pressure.

&lt;p&gt;You feel it before you see it: the drag of abrasive across primer, the subtle chatter in your wrist, the way dust plumes differently at the edge than it does in the center. The project might be a cabinet door with raised panels, an automotive quarter panel wearing its first coat of high-build, or a mid-century tabletop with a veneer you refuse to risk. Regardless of the substrate, the instrument in your hand—a sanding block—is the difference between flat and faceted, between crisp and crowned. When the pressure is wrong, the finish is wrong. The telltale symptoms appear later: telegraphed low spots under gloss, rounded edges where a sharp reveal should live, swirl hazing that refuses to die at the next grit.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/04.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/cards/facebook/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/cards/facebook/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/cards/facebook/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/cards/instagram/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/cards/instagram/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/cards/instagram/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/cards/facebook/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/cards/facebook/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/cards/facebook/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>13</readingTime></item><item><title>Remove Dust Nibs Between Clear Coat Layers</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 14:29:42 +0000</pubDate><category>Between-Coats Sanding</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-500</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>clear coat</category><category>dust control</category><category>wet sanding</category><description>Expert guide to between coats sanding—how to remove dust nibs, choose abrasives, and perfect clear coat finishes with pro-level workflows.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="between-coats-sanding-remove-dust-nibs-in-clear-coats"&gt;between coats sanding: remove dust nibs in clear coats&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A flawless clear coat is more than gloss; it’s the tactile confidence you feel when your hand glides across a panel with zero grit or drag. If you’ve ever stepped back from a gorgeous piece—be it a walnut tabletop, a painted cabinet door, or a guitar body—only to see and feel the specks of dust that settled into the finish, you know the sting. Those tiny dust nibs are an inevitable reality of shop air, static, and curing dynamics. Fortunately, they’re also manageable with disciplined surface prep, controlled technique, and smart abrasive choices. That’s the core of between coats sanding: deliberate, minimal-material removal focused on de-nibbing without compromising film build or clarity.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/25.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding/cards/instagram/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding/cards/instagram/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding/cards/instagram/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding/cards/pinterest/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding/cards/pinterest/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding/cards/pinterest/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/remove-dust-nibs-between-clear-coat-layers-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Scratch Pattern Control For Metal Panels Before Primer</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2025 15:09:37 +0000</pubDate><category>Metal Polishing &amp; Rust Repair</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><description>Learn expert scratch pattern control for metal panels before primer with step-by-step sanding, tool choices, and troubleshooting from a pro workshop</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="metal-surface-sanding-scratch-control-before-primer"&gt;Metal Surface Sanding: Scratch Control Before Primer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The evening a panel is finally quiet is when the real work begins. You kill the grinder, and suddenly it’s just you, a breath of solvent in the air, and sheet metal that shows everything—every ding mapped by light, every shallow wave you swore wasn’t there in the morning. I’ve been there with a door skin laid across sawhorses, work lamp low and unforgiving, palm testing the temperature of steel that still remembers the sander. This moment decides whether primer becomes a friend that hides your sins or a megaphone that announces every missed step.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/21.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding/cards/facebook/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding/cards/facebook/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding/cards/facebook/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding/cards/instagram/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding/cards/instagram/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding/cards/instagram/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding/cards/pinterest/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding/cards/pinterest/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding/cards/pinterest/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding/cards/facebook/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding/cards/facebook/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/11/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding/cards/facebook/scratch-pattern-control-for-metal-panels-before-primer-metal-surface-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Level 4 Versus Level 5 Wall Finish Explained</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/level-4-versus-level-5-wall-finish-explained-wall-finishing/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/level-4-versus-level-5-wall-finish-explained-wall-finishing/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2025 21:32:57 +0000</pubDate><category>Drywall Sanding</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-800</category><category>joint compound</category><category>clear coat</category><description>Engineer’s guide to Level 4 vs Level 5 drywall: optics, materials, costs, tests, and tips to choose the right wall finishing for paint and lighting.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="level-4-vs-level-5-wall-finishing-explained"&gt;Level 4 vs Level 5 Wall Finishing Explained&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even before the paint dries, the room tells you what you need to know. You step into a newly built living room at dusk. The pendant over the kitchen island throws a narrow cone; the western window sends a low, grazing wash across the longest wall. With the light switch up, the seams show themselves—not as obvious ridges, but as faint bands where reflectance changes with every step. The drywallers did everything “by the book.” Joints are filled, feathered, and sanded. Primer looks even. But the optics betray the truth: the wall absorbs and reflects differently where paper meets compound. That’s the moment when wall finishing becomes the difference between “good” and “finished.”&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/level-4-versus-level-5-wall-finish-explained-wall-finishing/cards/facebook/level-4-versus-level-5-wall-finish-explained-wall-finishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/level-4-versus-level-5-wall-finish-explained-wall-finishing/cards/facebook/level-4-versus-level-5-wall-finish-explained-wall-finishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/level-4-versus-level-5-wall-finish-explained-wall-finishing/cards/facebook/level-4-versus-level-5-wall-finish-explained-wall-finishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/level-4-versus-level-5-wall-finish-explained-wall-finishing/cards/instagram/level-4-versus-level-5-wall-finish-explained-wall-finishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/level-4-versus-level-5-wall-finish-explained-wall-finishing/cards/instagram/level-4-versus-level-5-wall-finish-explained-wall-finishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/level-4-versus-level-5-wall-finish-explained-wall-finishing/cards/instagram/level-4-versus-level-5-wall-finish-explained-wall-finishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/level-4-versus-level-5-wall-finish-explained-wall-finishing/cards/pinterest/level-4-versus-level-5-wall-finish-explained-wall-finishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/level-4-versus-level-5-wall-finish-explained-wall-finishing/cards/pinterest/level-4-versus-level-5-wall-finish-explained-wall-finishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/level-4-versus-level-5-wall-finish-explained-wall-finishing/cards/pinterest/level-4-versus-level-5-wall-finish-explained-wall-finishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/level-4-versus-level-5-wall-finish-explained-wall-finishing/cards/facebook/level-4-versus-level-5-wall-finish-explained-wall-finishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/level-4-versus-level-5-wall-finish-explained-wall-finishing/cards/facebook/level-4-versus-level-5-wall-finish-explained-wall-finishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/level-4-versus-level-5-wall-finish-explained-wall-finishing/cards/facebook/level-4-versus-level-5-wall-finish-explained-wall-finishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>How To Sand Baseboards Before Repainting Rooms</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-sand-baseboards-before-repainting-rooms-baseboard-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-sand-baseboards-before-repainting-rooms-baseboard-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2025 21:17:16 +0000</pubDate><category>Trim &amp; Molding Sanding</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>dust control</category><description>Learn expert baseboard sanding workflows for repainting: grit selection, tools, dust control, and pro prep steps for flawless trim coatings.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="baseboard-sanding-pro-workflow-for-repainting-rooms"&gt;Baseboard Sanding: Pro Workflow for Repainting Rooms&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The moment you move furniture, pull the drapes, and really look at your trim under morning light, the baseboards tell the story of the room. Years of shoes grazing the quarter round, vacuum scuffs where the wall meets the cap, and a glossy sheen that never quite cured right—these are the fingerprints of everyday life. The temptation is to tape a line and rush in with fresh paint. But in trim work, paint is only as good as the surface beneath it. Baseboard sanding is where a professional finish starts. It’s the quiet, meticulous part—deglossing hard alkyds so waterborne urethanes adhere, feathering raised chips until they disappear under primer, cutting micro-scratch patterns that promote uniform wetting. It’s dust extraction that protects your lungs and your topcoat, careful grit changes at the right moment, and an eye that knows when to repair versus when to replace.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/01.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-sand-baseboards-before-repainting-rooms-baseboard-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-baseboards-before-repainting-rooms-baseboard-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-sand-baseboards-before-repainting-rooms-baseboard-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-baseboards-before-repainting-rooms-baseboard-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-sand-baseboards-before-repainting-rooms-baseboard-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-baseboards-before-repainting-rooms-baseboard-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-sand-baseboards-before-repainting-rooms-baseboard-sanding/cards/instagram/how-to-sand-baseboards-before-repainting-rooms-baseboard-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-sand-baseboards-before-repainting-rooms-baseboard-sanding/cards/instagram/how-to-sand-baseboards-before-repainting-rooms-baseboard-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-sand-baseboards-before-repainting-rooms-baseboard-sanding/cards/instagram/how-to-sand-baseboards-before-repainting-rooms-baseboard-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-sand-baseboards-before-repainting-rooms-baseboard-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-to-sand-baseboards-before-repainting-rooms-baseboard-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-sand-baseboards-before-repainting-rooms-baseboard-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-to-sand-baseboards-before-repainting-rooms-baseboard-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-sand-baseboards-before-repainting-rooms-baseboard-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-to-sand-baseboards-before-repainting-rooms-baseboard-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-sand-baseboards-before-repainting-rooms-baseboard-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-baseboards-before-repainting-rooms-baseboard-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-sand-baseboards-before-repainting-rooms-baseboard-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-baseboards-before-repainting-rooms-baseboard-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-sand-baseboards-before-repainting-rooms-baseboard-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-baseboards-before-repainting-rooms-baseboard-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Choose Sanding Direction To Follow The Grain</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/09/choose-sanding-direction-to-follow-the-grain-hand-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/09/choose-sanding-direction-to-follow-the-grain-hand-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 09 Nov 2025 18:57:00 +0000</pubDate><category>Hand Sanding Techniques</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-500</category><description>Learn how to choose sanding direction, optimize abrasive performance, and master hand sanding workflows for flawless, grain-aligned wood surfaces.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="hand-sanding-with-the-grain-direction-that-wins"&gt;Hand Sanding With the Grain: Direction That Wins&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first pass across the old walnut dresser felt almost sacrilegious. Early light from the shop window caught the cathedral patterns in the veneer and made the scratches I’d inherited glow silver against the warm brown. Years of hasty refinishes had left low, cross-grain swirls that refused to disappear under fresh film. I set the random-orbit sander aside, reached for a cork block, and let the board tell me where it wanted me to go. In that moment, hand sanding was not about nostalgia—it was about control. Fingers learned the flow of the fibers, eyes trained on the raking light, strokes tracking the grain like a compass needle finally finding north.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/09/choose-sanding-direction-to-follow-the-grain-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/choose-sanding-direction-to-follow-the-grain-hand-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/09/choose-sanding-direction-to-follow-the-grain-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/choose-sanding-direction-to-follow-the-grain-hand-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/09/choose-sanding-direction-to-follow-the-grain-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/choose-sanding-direction-to-follow-the-grain-hand-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/09/choose-sanding-direction-to-follow-the-grain-hand-sanding/cards/instagram/choose-sanding-direction-to-follow-the-grain-hand-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/09/choose-sanding-direction-to-follow-the-grain-hand-sanding/cards/instagram/choose-sanding-direction-to-follow-the-grain-hand-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/09/choose-sanding-direction-to-follow-the-grain-hand-sanding/cards/instagram/choose-sanding-direction-to-follow-the-grain-hand-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/09/choose-sanding-direction-to-follow-the-grain-hand-sanding/cards/pinterest/choose-sanding-direction-to-follow-the-grain-hand-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/09/choose-sanding-direction-to-follow-the-grain-hand-sanding/cards/pinterest/choose-sanding-direction-to-follow-the-grain-hand-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/09/choose-sanding-direction-to-follow-the-grain-hand-sanding/cards/pinterest/choose-sanding-direction-to-follow-the-grain-hand-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/09/choose-sanding-direction-to-follow-the-grain-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/choose-sanding-direction-to-follow-the-grain-hand-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/09/choose-sanding-direction-to-follow-the-grain-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/choose-sanding-direction-to-follow-the-grain-hand-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/09/choose-sanding-direction-to-follow-the-grain-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/choose-sanding-direction-to-follow-the-grain-hand-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>When To Choose Ceramic Over Sic</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 08 Nov 2025 02:26:28 +0000</pubDate><category>Abrasive Materials &amp; Compounds</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><description>Learn when ceramic abrasives outperform silicon carbide sandpaper for metals, composites, and coatings, with actionable workflows and pro surface-prep tips.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="choosing-ceramic-vs-silicon-carbide-sandpaper"&gt;Choosing Ceramic vs Silicon Carbide Sandpaper&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can hear it before you see it: the sander spins up, the deck light pools across a panel, and the first passes scratch a story into the surface. On a chilly Saturday morning, I’m in a small body shop with two stacks on the cart—one ceramic-oxide disc set, one pile of silicon carbide sandpaper sheets. The job is a split personality: strip rust from a welded bracket, level high-build primer on a fender, then color-sand a fresh clear coat. The wrong abrasive wastes time and ruins finish; the right abrasive turns minutes into clean geometry and predictable gloss. And the smartest choice changes as the substrate, coating, and workflow change.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/instagram/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/instagram/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/instagram/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-ceramic-over-sic-silicon-carbide-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Let Epoxy Cure Fully Before Sanding</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 07 Nov 2025 16:25:05 +0000</pubDate><category>Plastic &amp; Epoxy Sanding</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-360</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit progression</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>Learn why letting epoxy fully cure before sanding is essential, plus timelines, tests, grit progressions, and pro tips for flawless, clear finishes.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="epoxy-sanding-why-waiting-to-cure-pays-off"&gt;Epoxy Sanding: Why Waiting to Cure Pays Off&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a point in every resin project when anticipation and restraint collide. You’ve de‑molded a river board you poured last weekend or set down a glossy flood coat on a tabletop, and the surface is whispering promises of glass-like clarity. You picture the final reveal: the light catching the grain, the resin depth turning everyday moments into a small ceremony. You also see the last mile between what is and what could be—the smoothing, refining, and polishing phase—also known as epoxy sanding. Your hands ache to pick up the sander. But this is where patience protects your craftsmanship.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding/cards/instagram/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding/cards/instagram/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding/cards/instagram/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding/cards/pinterest/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding/cards/pinterest/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding/cards/pinterest/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Reduce Swirls By Pairing Pad And Grit Correctly</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/reduce-swirls-by-pairing-pad-and-grit-correctly-sander-interface-pad/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/reduce-swirls-by-pairing-pad-and-grit-correctly-sander-interface-pad/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 06 Nov 2025 13:34:29 +0000</pubDate><category>Interface Pads &amp; Backing Pads</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><description>Learn how pairing a sander interface pad with the right grits reduces swirls, improves cut control, and optimizes dust extraction for flawless finishes.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="mastering-the-sander-interface-pad-to-erase-swirls"&gt;Mastering the sander interface pad to erase swirls&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It always shows up under raking light. You sweep your flashlight across a freshly primed cabinet door or a leveled epoxy table top, and there it is—faint haloing, tight hook-shaped pigtails, and a dull gray cast that just shouldn’t be there. You did the steps. You stepped up the grits. You vacuumed between passes. But the surface still whispers “machine marks.” The moment feels familiar to anyone chasing a clean finish on wood, primer, or clear coat. The fix isn’t more pressure, more passes, or a magic abrasive. It’s control—control of contact pressure, compliance, and cut geometry. And that’s exactly what a sander interface pad delivers when paired correctly with grit and machine settings.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/reduce-swirls-by-pairing-pad-and-grit-correctly-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/reduce-swirls-by-pairing-pad-and-grit-correctly-sander-interface-pad.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/reduce-swirls-by-pairing-pad-and-grit-correctly-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/reduce-swirls-by-pairing-pad-and-grit-correctly-sander-interface-pad.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/reduce-swirls-by-pairing-pad-and-grit-correctly-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/reduce-swirls-by-pairing-pad-and-grit-correctly-sander-interface-pad.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/reduce-swirls-by-pairing-pad-and-grit-correctly-sander-interface-pad/cards/instagram/reduce-swirls-by-pairing-pad-and-grit-correctly-sander-interface-pad.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/reduce-swirls-by-pairing-pad-and-grit-correctly-sander-interface-pad/cards/instagram/reduce-swirls-by-pairing-pad-and-grit-correctly-sander-interface-pad.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/reduce-swirls-by-pairing-pad-and-grit-correctly-sander-interface-pad/cards/instagram/reduce-swirls-by-pairing-pad-and-grit-correctly-sander-interface-pad.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/reduce-swirls-by-pairing-pad-and-grit-correctly-sander-interface-pad/cards/pinterest/reduce-swirls-by-pairing-pad-and-grit-correctly-sander-interface-pad.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/reduce-swirls-by-pairing-pad-and-grit-correctly-sander-interface-pad/cards/pinterest/reduce-swirls-by-pairing-pad-and-grit-correctly-sander-interface-pad.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/reduce-swirls-by-pairing-pad-and-grit-correctly-sander-interface-pad/cards/pinterest/reduce-swirls-by-pairing-pad-and-grit-correctly-sander-interface-pad.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/reduce-swirls-by-pairing-pad-and-grit-correctly-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/reduce-swirls-by-pairing-pad-and-grit-correctly-sander-interface-pad.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/reduce-swirls-by-pairing-pad-and-grit-correctly-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/reduce-swirls-by-pairing-pad-and-grit-correctly-sander-interface-pad.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/reduce-swirls-by-pairing-pad-and-grit-correctly-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/reduce-swirls-by-pairing-pad-and-grit-correctly-sander-interface-pad.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Washable Sanding Sponges For Longer Life</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 05 Nov 2025 16:30:43 +0000</pubDate><category>Sanding Sponges</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><description>Extend abrasive life with washable sanding sponges.

&lt;p&gt;You can hear it before you feel it: that faint change in pitch as a loaded abrasive skates across the surface rather than cutting it. In a small garage shop on a drizzly Saturday, a cabinetmaker pauses mid-pass, lifting his sanding sponge to the light. The face is clogged with a pale paste—sawdust and finish residue compacted into the foam’s pores. He hasn’t even reached final grit, but the cutting action is gone and heat is creeping in. In the past, this was when he would toss the sponge and reach for a new one, the cost quietly accumulating with every project. Today, he walks to the sink, rinses the sponge under lukewarm water, massages the face with a nylon brush, and watches the slurry shed away. Thirty seconds later, the abrasive bites again, the cut is cool and even, and the workflow stays on tempo.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge/cards/instagram/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge/cards/instagram/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge/cards/instagram/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge/cards/pinterest/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge/cards/pinterest/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge/cards/pinterest/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Keep Surfaces Flat With Rigid Blocks</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 05 Nov 2025 15:23:32 +0000</pubDate><category>Sanding Blocks</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>sanding block</category><description>Learn how rigid sanding blocks keep surfaces flat, when to use them, and the techniques, materials, and tips that deliver flawless, true results.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="keep-surfaces-flat-with-a-rigid-sanding-block"&gt;Keep Surfaces Flat with a Rigid Sanding Block&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a moment in any refinishing project when your eye catches the light just right and you see it: subtle waves in a tabletop, a faint ripple in primer, a break in the reflections across a glossy guitar body. You feel it with your fingertips too—those barely-there rises and dips that make the difference between “good enough” and “crafted.” I remember the first time I noticed how my results changed when I switched from a soft pad to a rigid sanding block. The surface I thought was “close” suddenly told the truth. Within a few careful passes, the highs dulled evenly and the lows showed as untouched pencil marks. In minutes, the surface was flatter than I’d ever achieved before.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/cards/facebook/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/cards/facebook/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/cards/facebook/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/cards/instagram/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/cards/instagram/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/cards/instagram/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/cards/facebook/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/cards/facebook/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/cards/facebook/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>13</readingTime></item><item><title>Difference Between Da And Random Orbital Sanding</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 05 Nov 2025 13:35:28 +0000</pubDate><category>Random Orbital Sanding</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>dust control</category><category>clear coat</category><category>orbital sander</category><description>An engineer’s guide to the difference between DA and random orbital sanding, with test-based advice on speed, finish, abrasives, and setup.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="da-vs-random-orbital-sanding-an-engineers-guide"&gt;DA vs random orbital sanding: an engineer’s guide&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning in the shop, the kettle clicks off as the garage door rolls up and a slab of maple waits on the sawhorses. The winter light is unforgiving; it shows every swirl that last year’s “good enough” sanding left behind. In one hand: a well-balanced 5-inch palm sander; in the other: a heavier, gear-driven unit that can bulldoze epoxy ridges like a planer. The decision—random orbital sanding or the so-called DA—doesn’t feel philosophical. It’s practical. Do I want a fast, aggressive cut to level those glue lines, or a controlled, low-risk finish for the final passes? If you’ve ever chased phantom swirls under a bright lamp or watched edges burn through because you leaned a degree too far, you know the stakes.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/instagram/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/instagram/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/instagram/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/pinterest/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/pinterest/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/pinterest/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding/cards/facebook/difference-between-da-and-random-orbital-sanding-random-orbital-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Best Grit For Sanding Between Coats Of Polyurethane</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 05 Nov 2025 04:59:16 +0000</pubDate><category>Between-Coats Sanding</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>dry sanding</category><category>clear coat</category><category>sanding block</category><description>Learn the best grit for sanding between coats of polyurethane, when to sand, and how to get a flawless, dust-free finish with pro-tested techniques.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="between-coats-sanding-best-grit-for-polyurethane"&gt;Between Coats Sanding: Best Grit for Polyurethane&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first time you run your hand across a newly finished table and feel the faint drag of tiny dust nibs, you understand why the small steps matter. Maybe it’s a maple dining top you’ve been nursing through long evenings, or a simple pine shelf that somehow carries outsized meaning. You’ve brushed on a smooth coat, waited patiently, and yet—under a raking light—tiny specks wink back at you like a constellation you didn’t intend to draw. That’s the moment when many projects turn from “good enough” to “I want this perfect.” And the bridge to perfect is almost always between coats sanding.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding/cards/instagram/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding/cards/instagram/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding/cards/instagram/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding/cards/pinterest/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding/cards/pinterest/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding/cards/pinterest/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-for-sanding-between-coats-of-polyurethane-between-coats-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Scuff Sand Glossy Paint To Improve Primer Adhesion</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 05 Nov 2025 04:18:59 +0000</pubDate><category>Paint Removal &amp; Surface Prep</category><category>paint prep</category><category>rust removal</category><category>primer coat</category><category>sanding block</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>dust control</category><description>Learn how to scuff sand glossy paint for superior primer adhesion.

&lt;p&gt;There’s a moment every DIYer knows: coffee in hand, paint tray loaded, roller whispering across the wall—and then the dreaded slip. The glossy trim or cabinet door you thought you tamed suddenly sheds the new coat like a rain jacket, beading, sliding, or peeling on touch. I’ve been in that room more times than I can count, from weekend bathrooms to full commercial corridors, and the conclusion’s always the same—before color comes control. That control starts with surface preparation. Not flashy, not glamorous, but it’s the one step that makes every coat after it look better and last longer.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation/cards/facebook/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation/cards/facebook/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation/cards/facebook/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation/cards/instagram/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation/cards/instagram/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation/cards/instagram/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation/cards/pinterest/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation/cards/pinterest/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation/cards/pinterest/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation/cards/facebook/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation/cards/facebook/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation/cards/facebook/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Identify Surface Rust Versus Scale And Perforation</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/identify-surface-rust-versus-scale-and-perforation-rust-repair/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/identify-surface-rust-versus-scale-and-perforation-rust-repair/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 05 Nov 2025 04:10:19 +0000</pubDate><category>Metal Polishing &amp; Rust Repair</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>rust removal</category><description>Engineer’s guide to identify surface rust, scale, and perforation, with testing methods, abrasives, and rust repair decisions for lasting results.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="rust-repair-spotting-surface-scale-and-perforation"&gt;Rust Repair: Spotting Surface, Scale, and Perforation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning light caught the fender of my old wagon just right, the way it sometimes does when you’re not quite awake and not quite rushing. A faint blister under the paint telegraphed something I’ve learned to notice: the subtle topography of oxidation. It’s the kind of moment most of us meet with a sigh and a glance away. I paused instead. As a product engineer who’s spent years testing abrasives, primers, and coatings, I’ve learned that the difference between a quick cosmetic tune-up and a structural failure starts with how we look at rust—and how early we decide to act on it. Whether you wrench on weekends or you’re planning a professional rust repair, the first step is classification. Is it only surface rust that can be abraded clean? Is it scale that has undermined the steel layers? Or is it perforation where oxygen and time have already won a hole through the sheet?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/identify-surface-rust-versus-scale-and-perforation-rust-repair/cards/facebook/identify-surface-rust-versus-scale-and-perforation-rust-repair.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/identify-surface-rust-versus-scale-and-perforation-rust-repair/cards/facebook/identify-surface-rust-versus-scale-and-perforation-rust-repair.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/identify-surface-rust-versus-scale-and-perforation-rust-repair/cards/facebook/identify-surface-rust-versus-scale-and-perforation-rust-repair.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/identify-surface-rust-versus-scale-and-perforation-rust-repair/cards/instagram/identify-surface-rust-versus-scale-and-perforation-rust-repair.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/identify-surface-rust-versus-scale-and-perforation-rust-repair/cards/instagram/identify-surface-rust-versus-scale-and-perforation-rust-repair.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/identify-surface-rust-versus-scale-and-perforation-rust-repair/cards/instagram/identify-surface-rust-versus-scale-and-perforation-rust-repair.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/identify-surface-rust-versus-scale-and-perforation-rust-repair/cards/pinterest/identify-surface-rust-versus-scale-and-perforation-rust-repair.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/identify-surface-rust-versus-scale-and-perforation-rust-repair/cards/pinterest/identify-surface-rust-versus-scale-and-perforation-rust-repair.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/identify-surface-rust-versus-scale-and-perforation-rust-repair/cards/pinterest/identify-surface-rust-versus-scale-and-perforation-rust-repair.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/identify-surface-rust-versus-scale-and-perforation-rust-repair/cards/facebook/identify-surface-rust-versus-scale-and-perforation-rust-repair.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/identify-surface-rust-versus-scale-and-perforation-rust-repair/cards/facebook/identify-surface-rust-versus-scale-and-perforation-rust-repair.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/identify-surface-rust-versus-scale-and-perforation-rust-repair/cards/facebook/identify-surface-rust-versus-scale-and-perforation-rust-repair.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Best Grit For Deck Sanding Before Staining</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/best-grit-for-deck-sanding-before-staining-deck-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/best-grit-for-deck-sanding-before-staining-deck-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 04 Nov 2025 19:32:49 +0000</pubDate><category>Floor &amp; Deck Sanding</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-320</category><category>deck sanding</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Engineer-tested guide to the best grit for deck sanding before staining, with abrasive science, tool choices, and proven sanding sequences.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="best-grit-for-deck-sanding-before-staining"&gt;Best Grit for Deck Sanding Before Staining&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning sunlight hits the deck and it looks like two decks at once: the cheerful gathering place you want for the season ahead, and the weathered surface you’ve come to ignore—grayed, patchy stain, a couple of raised splinters in the traffic lane from the back door. If you’ve decided to refresh it, you’ll run into a deceptively technical question right away: what’s the best grit for deck sanding before staining? As a product engineer who field-tests tools and abrasives, I’ve learned that grit choice isn’t a cosmetic preference—it’s a performance variable that decides how well stain bonds, how evenly it soaks, and how long your finish resists UV and foot traffic. In deck sanding, you aren’t polishing furniture; you’re tuning the surface profile to balance penetration and smoothness.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/best-grit-for-deck-sanding-before-staining-deck-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-for-deck-sanding-before-staining-deck-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/best-grit-for-deck-sanding-before-staining-deck-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-for-deck-sanding-before-staining-deck-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/best-grit-for-deck-sanding-before-staining-deck-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-for-deck-sanding-before-staining-deck-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/best-grit-for-deck-sanding-before-staining-deck-sanding/cards/instagram/best-grit-for-deck-sanding-before-staining-deck-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/best-grit-for-deck-sanding-before-staining-deck-sanding/cards/instagram/best-grit-for-deck-sanding-before-staining-deck-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/best-grit-for-deck-sanding-before-staining-deck-sanding/cards/instagram/best-grit-for-deck-sanding-before-staining-deck-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/best-grit-for-deck-sanding-before-staining-deck-sanding/cards/pinterest/best-grit-for-deck-sanding-before-staining-deck-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/best-grit-for-deck-sanding-before-staining-deck-sanding/cards/pinterest/best-grit-for-deck-sanding-before-staining-deck-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/best-grit-for-deck-sanding-before-staining-deck-sanding/cards/pinterest/best-grit-for-deck-sanding-before-staining-deck-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/best-grit-for-deck-sanding-before-staining-deck-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-for-deck-sanding-before-staining-deck-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/best-grit-for-deck-sanding-before-staining-deck-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-for-deck-sanding-before-staining-deck-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/best-grit-for-deck-sanding-before-staining-deck-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-for-deck-sanding-before-staining-deck-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>How Long To Wait Before Sanding Joint Compound</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-long-to-wait-before-sanding-joint-compound-joint-compound-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-long-to-wait-before-sanding-joint-compound-joint-compound-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 04 Nov 2025 17:23:25 +0000</pubDate><category>Drywall Sanding</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>joint compound</category><category>dust control</category><description>Learn precise wait times, drying variables, and pro sanding workflows to prevent gouges and dust when sanding joint compound.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="how-long-to-wait-for-joint-compound-sanding"&gt;How Long to Wait for Joint Compound Sanding&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s 10:47 p.m. You’ve spent the evening in a quiet room, spreading thin, even passes of mud across seams that once shadowed your drywall. The lights are low; the blade marks are almost gone. You resist the urge to sand right now because experience whispers that impatience leads to rework. The air smells faintly of gypsum and paint primer, and the walls look nearly finished—but the clock matters more than appearances. Joint compound sanding isn’t just a step; it’s the inflection point between a surface that telegraphs flaws under paint and one that disappears behind a flawless finish.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-long-to-wait-before-sanding-joint-compound-joint-compound-sanding/cards/facebook/how-long-to-wait-before-sanding-joint-compound-joint-compound-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-long-to-wait-before-sanding-joint-compound-joint-compound-sanding/cards/facebook/how-long-to-wait-before-sanding-joint-compound-joint-compound-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-long-to-wait-before-sanding-joint-compound-joint-compound-sanding/cards/facebook/how-long-to-wait-before-sanding-joint-compound-joint-compound-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-long-to-wait-before-sanding-joint-compound-joint-compound-sanding/cards/instagram/how-long-to-wait-before-sanding-joint-compound-joint-compound-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-long-to-wait-before-sanding-joint-compound-joint-compound-sanding/cards/instagram/how-long-to-wait-before-sanding-joint-compound-joint-compound-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-long-to-wait-before-sanding-joint-compound-joint-compound-sanding/cards/instagram/how-long-to-wait-before-sanding-joint-compound-joint-compound-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-long-to-wait-before-sanding-joint-compound-joint-compound-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-long-to-wait-before-sanding-joint-compound-joint-compound-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-long-to-wait-before-sanding-joint-compound-joint-compound-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-long-to-wait-before-sanding-joint-compound-joint-compound-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-long-to-wait-before-sanding-joint-compound-joint-compound-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-long-to-wait-before-sanding-joint-compound-joint-compound-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-long-to-wait-before-sanding-joint-compound-joint-compound-sanding/cards/facebook/how-long-to-wait-before-sanding-joint-compound-joint-compound-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-long-to-wait-before-sanding-joint-compound-joint-compound-sanding/cards/facebook/how-long-to-wait-before-sanding-joint-compound-joint-compound-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-long-to-wait-before-sanding-joint-compound-joint-compound-sanding/cards/facebook/how-long-to-wait-before-sanding-joint-compound-joint-compound-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>How To Sand Crown Molding Profiles Without Flattening</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 04 Nov 2025 16:44:08 +0000</pubDate><category>Trim &amp; Molding Sanding</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>sanding block</category><category>primer coat</category><category>dust control</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Learn how to sand crown molding without flattening profiles.

&lt;p&gt;On a quiet Saturday morning, you finally pull the drop cloths over your living room floor and tilt a lamp toward the ceiling. The crown molding looks elegant from a distance, but up close the paint has chipped at the corners and the once-crisp beads have gone a little blurry. You run a fingertip along a cove that should feel like a clean arc, and instead it’s a soft bump. That’s the moment when most DIYers decide to sand—and the moment many profiles lose their sharp character. The goal isn’t to erase the molding’s shape; it’s to refine the surface. With a thoughtful approach to molding sanding, you can keep each flare, bead, and cove true while preparing for a flawless new finish.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding/cards/instagram/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding/cards/instagram/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding/cards/instagram/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>How To Repair Chipped Or Lifting Veneer Before Refinishing</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-repair-chipped-or-lifting-veneer-before-refinishing-furniture-restoration/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-repair-chipped-or-lifting-veneer-before-refinishing-furniture-restoration/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 04 Nov 2025 15:40:12 +0000</pubDate><category>Furniture Refinishing</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-1000</category><description>Learn how to repair chipped or lifting veneer before refinishing.

&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning, shop lights warm, coffee cooling on the bench. I slide a hand over a walnut dresser that’s outlived two generations. It has presence—clean lines, true drawers, the kind of proportions you can’t fake—but the veneer tells a rougher story. One front edge is chipped back to the substrate. A corner has lifted into a sharp little tent. Water once sat beneath a pot, raising a blister the size of a thumb. You could pass this piece over at a thrift store and never know what it could become. Or you can see it for what it is: a solid candidate for furniture restoration with a few smart, careful veneer repairs.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-repair-chipped-or-lifting-veneer-before-refinishing-furniture-restoration/cards/facebook/how-to-repair-chipped-or-lifting-veneer-before-refinishing-furniture-restoration.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-repair-chipped-or-lifting-veneer-before-refinishing-furniture-restoration/cards/facebook/how-to-repair-chipped-or-lifting-veneer-before-refinishing-furniture-restoration.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-repair-chipped-or-lifting-veneer-before-refinishing-furniture-restoration/cards/facebook/how-to-repair-chipped-or-lifting-veneer-before-refinishing-furniture-restoration.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-repair-chipped-or-lifting-veneer-before-refinishing-furniture-restoration/cards/instagram/how-to-repair-chipped-or-lifting-veneer-before-refinishing-furniture-restoration.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-repair-chipped-or-lifting-veneer-before-refinishing-furniture-restoration/cards/instagram/how-to-repair-chipped-or-lifting-veneer-before-refinishing-furniture-restoration.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-repair-chipped-or-lifting-veneer-before-refinishing-furniture-restoration/cards/instagram/how-to-repair-chipped-or-lifting-veneer-before-refinishing-furniture-restoration.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-repair-chipped-or-lifting-veneer-before-refinishing-furniture-restoration/cards/pinterest/how-to-repair-chipped-or-lifting-veneer-before-refinishing-furniture-restoration.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-repair-chipped-or-lifting-veneer-before-refinishing-furniture-restoration/cards/pinterest/how-to-repair-chipped-or-lifting-veneer-before-refinishing-furniture-restoration.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-repair-chipped-or-lifting-veneer-before-refinishing-furniture-restoration/cards/pinterest/how-to-repair-chipped-or-lifting-veneer-before-refinishing-furniture-restoration.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-repair-chipped-or-lifting-veneer-before-refinishing-furniture-restoration/cards/facebook/how-to-repair-chipped-or-lifting-veneer-before-refinishing-furniture-restoration.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-repair-chipped-or-lifting-veneer-before-refinishing-furniture-restoration/cards/facebook/how-to-repair-chipped-or-lifting-veneer-before-refinishing-furniture-restoration.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-repair-chipped-or-lifting-veneer-before-refinishing-furniture-restoration/cards/facebook/how-to-repair-chipped-or-lifting-veneer-before-refinishing-furniture-restoration.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Raise The Grain With Water Before Final Sanding</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/raise-the-grain-with-water-before-final-sanding-grain-preparation/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/raise-the-grain-with-water-before-final-sanding-grain-preparation/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 04 Nov 2025 13:36:49 +0000</pubDate><category>Wood sanding</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Engineer-tested methods for grain preparation: why wet-raising wood before final sanding improves stain uniformity and surface smoothness.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="grain-preparation-raise-the-grain-before-final-sanding"&gt;Grain Preparation: Raise the Grain Before Final Sanding&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first time I watched a walnut tabletop go from silky-smooth to prickly in minutes, I winced. I had sanded carefully through the grits, vacuumed, inspected under raking light—then I misted it with water. Within ten minutes, tiny “whiskers” stood up across the surface like a five o’clock shadow. If you’re new to this, the instinct is to panic. But as a product engineer who spends days measuring scratch patterns, fiber deformation, and finish adhesion, I’ve learned that moment is when control begins. What looks like backtracking is actually the most reliable path to a level, refined finish. It’s the heart of grain preparation.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/raise-the-grain-with-water-before-final-sanding-grain-preparation/cards/facebook/raise-the-grain-with-water-before-final-sanding-grain-preparation.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/raise-the-grain-with-water-before-final-sanding-grain-preparation/cards/facebook/raise-the-grain-with-water-before-final-sanding-grain-preparation.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/raise-the-grain-with-water-before-final-sanding-grain-preparation/cards/facebook/raise-the-grain-with-water-before-final-sanding-grain-preparation.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/raise-the-grain-with-water-before-final-sanding-grain-preparation/cards/instagram/raise-the-grain-with-water-before-final-sanding-grain-preparation.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/raise-the-grain-with-water-before-final-sanding-grain-preparation/cards/instagram/raise-the-grain-with-water-before-final-sanding-grain-preparation.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/raise-the-grain-with-water-before-final-sanding-grain-preparation/cards/instagram/raise-the-grain-with-water-before-final-sanding-grain-preparation.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/raise-the-grain-with-water-before-final-sanding-grain-preparation/cards/pinterest/raise-the-grain-with-water-before-final-sanding-grain-preparation.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/raise-the-grain-with-water-before-final-sanding-grain-preparation/cards/pinterest/raise-the-grain-with-water-before-final-sanding-grain-preparation.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/raise-the-grain-with-water-before-final-sanding-grain-preparation/cards/pinterest/raise-the-grain-with-water-before-final-sanding-grain-preparation.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/raise-the-grain-with-water-before-final-sanding-grain-preparation/cards/facebook/raise-the-grain-with-water-before-final-sanding-grain-preparation.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/raise-the-grain-with-water-before-final-sanding-grain-preparation/cards/facebook/raise-the-grain-with-water-before-final-sanding-grain-preparation.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/raise-the-grain-with-water-before-final-sanding-grain-preparation/cards/facebook/raise-the-grain-with-water-before-final-sanding-grain-preparation.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Standardize Cut Rate Test Procedures</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/standardize-cut-rate-test-procedures-abrasive-testing/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/standardize-cut-rate-test-procedures-abrasive-testing/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 04 Nov 2025 03:45:12 +0000</pubDate><category>Abrasive Innovation &amp; Testing</category><category>grit-320</category><description>Learn how to standardize cut rate test procedures for abrasives with precise protocols, controlled variables, and reproducible data across labs.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="standardizing-abrasive-testing-for-cut-rate"&gt;Standardizing Abrasive Testing for Cut Rate&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The day before a critical ship-out, I watched a fabricator lean into a 36-grit ceramic belt, chasing a hot streak across a stubborn stainless coupon. The clock said 4:42 p.m., the air smelled like quenched metal, and the part needed a uniform finish before welding at dawn. He’d tested three belts over two weeks and still didn’t know which one would chew through scale faster without burning the edges. The problem wasn’t skill—he had that in spades. The problem was data. His “test” consisted of feel, sound, and a gut sense of speed. Useful to a point—but not when deadlines hinge on repeatable outcomes. This is where standardized abrasive testing elevates experience into a defensible workflow.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/standardize-cut-rate-test-procedures-abrasive-testing/cards/facebook/standardize-cut-rate-test-procedures-abrasive-testing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/standardize-cut-rate-test-procedures-abrasive-testing/cards/facebook/standardize-cut-rate-test-procedures-abrasive-testing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/standardize-cut-rate-test-procedures-abrasive-testing/cards/facebook/standardize-cut-rate-test-procedures-abrasive-testing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/standardize-cut-rate-test-procedures-abrasive-testing/cards/instagram/standardize-cut-rate-test-procedures-abrasive-testing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/standardize-cut-rate-test-procedures-abrasive-testing/cards/instagram/standardize-cut-rate-test-procedures-abrasive-testing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/standardize-cut-rate-test-procedures-abrasive-testing/cards/instagram/standardize-cut-rate-test-procedures-abrasive-testing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/standardize-cut-rate-test-procedures-abrasive-testing/cards/pinterest/standardize-cut-rate-test-procedures-abrasive-testing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/standardize-cut-rate-test-procedures-abrasive-testing/cards/pinterest/standardize-cut-rate-test-procedures-abrasive-testing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/standardize-cut-rate-test-procedures-abrasive-testing/cards/pinterest/standardize-cut-rate-test-procedures-abrasive-testing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/standardize-cut-rate-test-procedures-abrasive-testing/cards/facebook/standardize-cut-rate-test-procedures-abrasive-testing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/standardize-cut-rate-test-procedures-abrasive-testing/cards/facebook/standardize-cut-rate-test-procedures-abrasive-testing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/standardize-cut-rate-test-procedures-abrasive-testing/cards/facebook/standardize-cut-rate-test-procedures-abrasive-testing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Compare Disc Life And Cut Rate</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/compare-disc-life-and-cut-rate-best-sandpaper-brand/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/compare-disc-life-and-cut-rate-best-sandpaper-brand/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 04 Nov 2025 03:12:55 +0000</pubDate><category>Brand &amp; Quality Comparison</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>dust control</category><description>Engineer’s test comparing disc life and cut rate to pick the best sandpaper brand, with tips, brand picks, and methods for wood and finish sanding.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="best-sandpaper-brand-disc-life-vs-cut-rate"&gt;Best sandpaper brand: disc life vs cut rate&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still remember the first time I tried to rescue my grandmother’s maple kitchen table. The top was a scabbed map of water rings and burnished scratches, the kind of patina that tells a story but divides a family: refinish or preserve. I set the random-orbit sander on the surface, clicked on the dust extractor, and braced for the ritual dance—slow passes, overlapping lanes, listening for that pitch that says the abrasive is biting. Ten minutes in, the first disc glazed. I swapped brands, then grits. Some discs cut fast but shed grit like confetti. Others ran cool but bogged down in resin-rich end grain. At the end of that long Saturday, I wasn’t just evaluating a finish.

&lt;p&gt;A fresh sheet on a random-orbit sander tells you a lot in the first few seconds: the pitch of the motor settles, dust streams through the holes, and the panel under your palm either glides or grabs. On a soft pine shelf heavy with resin, the wrong abrasive loads so fast you can smell the heat within a minute. The scratch blends into a smeared sheen, then the pad starts skating—not cutting. You lift the sander and the disc is glazed with gummy dust cakes. The fix isn’t more pressure or another pass; it’s choosing the right coat density. That’s where open coat sandpaper, with intentional spacing between grains, changes the whole day’s trajectory.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/open-versus-closed-coat-applications-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/open-versus-closed-coat-applications-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/open-versus-closed-coat-applications-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/open-versus-closed-coat-applications-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/open-versus-closed-coat-applications-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/open-versus-closed-coat-applications-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/open-versus-closed-coat-applications-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/instagram/open-versus-closed-coat-applications-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/open-versus-closed-coat-applications-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/instagram/open-versus-closed-coat-applications-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/open-versus-closed-coat-applications-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/instagram/open-versus-closed-coat-applications-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/open-versus-closed-coat-applications-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/open-versus-closed-coat-applications-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/open-versus-closed-coat-applications-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/open-versus-closed-coat-applications-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/open-versus-closed-coat-applications-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/pinterest/open-versus-closed-coat-applications-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/open-versus-closed-coat-applications-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/open-versus-closed-coat-applications-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/open-versus-closed-coat-applications-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/open-versus-closed-coat-applications-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/open-versus-closed-coat-applications-open-coat-sandpaper/cards/facebook/open-versus-closed-coat-applications-open-coat-sandpaper.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Sand Gelcoat Before Repairs Or Coating</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/sand-gelcoat-before-repairs-or-coating-boat-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/sand-gelcoat-before-repairs-or-coating-boat-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 23:56:18 +0000</pubDate><category>Marine Sanding</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-280</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-600</category><category>dry sanding</category><category>dust control</category><category>wet sanding</category><description>Engineer-tested guide to boat sanding gelcoat for repairs or recoating: grits, tools, wet vs dry, adhesion science, and step-by-step prep.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="boat-sanding-for-gelcoat-repairs-prep-and-technique"&gt;Boat sanding for gelcoat repairs: prep and technique&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The morning wind riffles the marina flags as you step onto the dock with a sander in one hand and masking tape in the other. Yesterday’s chop left salt crystals on the rails; last season left a constellation of nicks in the gelcoat, a chalky haze along the topsides, and the faint outline of old repairs. It’s tempting to rush straight to coating—one more layer to hide the blemishes—but that only traps problems under gloss. The difference between a repair that lasts one season and one that lasts a decade starts long before the roller hits the pan. It starts with boat sanding done with intention.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/sand-gelcoat-before-repairs-or-coating-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/sand-gelcoat-before-repairs-or-coating-boat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/sand-gelcoat-before-repairs-or-coating-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/sand-gelcoat-before-repairs-or-coating-boat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/sand-gelcoat-before-repairs-or-coating-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/sand-gelcoat-before-repairs-or-coating-boat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/sand-gelcoat-before-repairs-or-coating-boat-sanding/cards/instagram/sand-gelcoat-before-repairs-or-coating-boat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/sand-gelcoat-before-repairs-or-coating-boat-sanding/cards/instagram/sand-gelcoat-before-repairs-or-coating-boat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/sand-gelcoat-before-repairs-or-coating-boat-sanding/cards/instagram/sand-gelcoat-before-repairs-or-coating-boat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/sand-gelcoat-before-repairs-or-coating-boat-sanding/cards/pinterest/sand-gelcoat-before-repairs-or-coating-boat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/sand-gelcoat-before-repairs-or-coating-boat-sanding/cards/pinterest/sand-gelcoat-before-repairs-or-coating-boat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/sand-gelcoat-before-repairs-or-coating-boat-sanding/cards/pinterest/sand-gelcoat-before-repairs-or-coating-boat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/sand-gelcoat-before-repairs-or-coating-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/sand-gelcoat-before-repairs-or-coating-boat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/sand-gelcoat-before-repairs-or-coating-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/sand-gelcoat-before-repairs-or-coating-boat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/sand-gelcoat-before-repairs-or-coating-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/sand-gelcoat-before-repairs-or-coating-boat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Use Diamond Or Sic For Glass Edges</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 23:29:24 +0000</pubDate><category>Glass &amp; Ceramics Sanding</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-280</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1200</category><category>grit-2500</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>wet sanding</category><description>Technical guide to glass sanding for chip‑free edges using diamond or SiC abrasives, with grit sequences, coolant control, and polishing workflows.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="glass-sanding-for-clean-safe-edges-diamond-vs-sic"&gt;Glass sanding for clean, safe edges: diamond vs SiC&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The moment you lift a freshly cut pane, you feel it: the edge that looks fine from arm’s length but carries invisible threats—micro-chips, stress risers, and the slight granular drag under a fingertip that says the finish is not ready for handling. Anyone who has ever fit a glass shelf, framed a museum-grade print, or repurposed a bottle knows that the edge is where projects succeed or fail. That’s where glass sanding earns its keep. Thoughtful abrasive selection and disciplined technique turn a risky raw cut into a safe, optically clean edge that won’t shed fragments, haze, or propagate cracks under load. Whether you’re tuning a small arris for furniture-grade touch or chasing an optical polish on a laminated panel, the goal is the same: remove damage quickly, control heat, and leave a tight subsurface that won’t surprise you months later.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding/cards/instagram/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding/cards/instagram/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding/cards/instagram/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding/cards/pinterest/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding/cards/pinterest/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding/cards/pinterest/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>14</readingTime></item><item><title>Polish Epoxy Resin To Glass Like Finish</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 21:00:08 +0000</pubDate><category>Resin Polishing</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-1500</category><description>Learn how to polish epoxy resin to a glass-like finish with step-by-step sanding, heat control, compounds, and pro tips for durable clarity.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="resin-polishing-for-a-glass-like-epoxy-finish"&gt;Resin Polishing for a Glass-Like Epoxy Finish&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first time you run a fingertip across an epoxy surface, it’s a little magic trick. The light catches, colors bloom, and you expect the kind of clarity you see on showroom glass. But if you’ve poured, leveled, and cured resin yourself, you also know the moment that follows: under sunlight or a raking lamp, faint haze, scratch patterns, or tiny undulations whisper that the job isn’t quite done. That’s where resonant craftsmanship meets patience—where resin polishing turns a good pour into a gleaming, glass-like finish.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing/cards/instagram/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing/cards/instagram/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing/cards/instagram/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing/cards/pinterest/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing/cards/pinterest/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing/cards/pinterest/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>14</readingTime></item><item><title>Soak Time For Wet Sanding Papers</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/soak-time-for-wet-sanding-papers-wet-dry-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 19:47:57 +0000</pubDate><category>Waterproof &amp; Wet/Dry Paper</category><category>grit-280</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-1200</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>wet sanding</category><description>Learn the optimal soak times for wet dry sandpaper, how soaking affects abrasive performance, and precise workflows for wood, paint, and metal.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="wet-dry-sandpaper-soak-times-a-technical-guide"&gt;Wet Dry Sandpaper Soak Times: A Technical Guide&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shop is quiet except for the slow drip from a rinse bottle, pooling across a workbench where a clear-coated guitar body breathes under the lights. There’s a shallow tray of clean water, a few folded sheets of wet dry sandpaper, and a foam pad waiting like a promise. You press a fingertip to the lacquer—weeks of curing have left it hard, crisp, and unforgiving. You remember the last time you rushed the process and chased pigtails under a glaring shop light. Not today.

&lt;p&gt;It starts with a Saturday I swore would stay simple: flatten the maple tabletop, ease the edges, oil by sunset. I had a stack of sheets from two shops—some labeled P120 and P240, others just 120 and 220. When sunlight hit the tabletop at a shallow angle, I could see crosshatched scratches ghosting under the grain. I stepped through abrasives the way I always do, yet the finish looked inconsistent. I grabbed a sandpaper grit chart I’d printed months ago, the kind that tries to equate FEPA “P” grades and U.S. CAMI numbers. The numbers lined up on paper, but my surface still didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/fepa-versus-cami-grit-equivalence-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/fepa-versus-cami-grit-equivalence-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/fepa-versus-cami-grit-equivalence-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/fepa-versus-cami-grit-equivalence-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/fepa-versus-cami-grit-equivalence-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/fepa-versus-cami-grit-equivalence-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/fepa-versus-cami-grit-equivalence-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/instagram/fepa-versus-cami-grit-equivalence-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/fepa-versus-cami-grit-equivalence-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/instagram/fepa-versus-cami-grit-equivalence-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/fepa-versus-cami-grit-equivalence-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/instagram/fepa-versus-cami-grit-equivalence-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/fepa-versus-cami-grit-equivalence-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/pinterest/fepa-versus-cami-grit-equivalence-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/fepa-versus-cami-grit-equivalence-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/pinterest/fepa-versus-cami-grit-equivalence-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/fepa-versus-cami-grit-equivalence-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/pinterest/fepa-versus-cami-grit-equivalence-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/fepa-versus-cami-grit-equivalence-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/fepa-versus-cami-grit-equivalence-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/fepa-versus-cami-grit-equivalence-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/fepa-versus-cami-grit-equivalence-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/fepa-versus-cami-grit-equivalence-sandpaper-grit-chart/cards/facebook/fepa-versus-cami-grit-equivalence-sandpaper-grit-chart.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>13</readingTime></item><item><title>When To Use Soft Versus Firm Interface Pads</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 05:14:43 +0000</pubDate><category>Interface Pads &amp; Backing Pads</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>clear coat</category><description>Learn when to use soft vs firm sander interface pads for smoother finishes, faster leveling, and fewer defects across woodworking and auto refinishing.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="soft-vs-firm-sander-interface-pad-when-to-choose"&gt;Soft vs Firm Sander Interface Pad: When to Choose&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It starts with dust floating in the morning light and a project that matters. Maybe it’s a maple dresser you’ve promised to refinish before the baby arrives, or a fender blend on a car that’s taken you months to prep. Your sander hums to life, and the first pass feels promising—until you notice faint scratches where the grain curves, or a rounded edge where you wanted a crisp line. The tool didn’t change. The abrasive didn’t change. The difference is the cushion between them: the sander interface pad. It’s a small layer, but it decides how much pressure reaches the surface, how evenly the grit cuts, and whether the final result shows craftsmanship or compromise.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/instagram/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/instagram/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/instagram/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/pinterest/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/pinterest/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/pinterest/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad/cards/facebook/when-to-use-soft-versus-firm-interface-pads-sander-interface-pad.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Velcro Disc Attachment For Orbital Sanders</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 04:51:13 +0000</pubDate><category>Hook-and-Loop Discs</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>orbital sander</category><description>Engineer-tested guide to hook and loop sanding discs, from pad heat and disc selection to failure modes, setup tips, and performance tests.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="hook-and-loop-sanding-discs-for-orbital-sanders"&gt;Hook and Loop Sanding Discs for Orbital Sanders&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Saturday morning in the shop starts with optimism—the kind that comes with fresh coffee, a new sheet of maple, and the subtle hum of a random orbital sander spooling up. Ten minutes later, optimism hits the floor with the sanding disc. If you’ve been there, you know the feeling: the Velcro-style backing is glazed, the pad hooks are shiny and rounded over, and every new disc lasts a little shorter than the last. The culprit isn’t just cheap consumables; more often it’s heat, pressure, and a mismatch between tool, pad, and abrasive. This is where hook and loop sanding discs earn both their reputation for convenience and the blame when the system isn’t set up correctly.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>15</readingTime></item><item><title>Best Grit Sponges For Trim And Profiles</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/best-grit-sponges-for-trim-and-profiles-sanding-sponge/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/best-grit-sponges-for-trim-and-profiles-sanding-sponge/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 03:21:23 +0000</pubDate><category>Sanding Sponges</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-600</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>Find the best sanding sponge grits for trim and profiles.

&lt;p&gt;The first time you notice your trim is when it looks wrong. It might be the sunlight clipping across a paneled door at mid-morning, suddenly revealing raised brush lines, tiny dust nibs, and a few mystery divots at the chair rail. Or maybe it’s the crown molding you’ve always loved, now dulled by a hundred handprints and the quiet scrapes of a step ladder. That’s the moment: when care meets craft. You want your woodwork to feel clean and precise, to show off the curves and profiles rather than the flaws. And that’s when a simple, overlooked tool quietly becomes essential—the sanding sponge.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/best-grit-sponges-for-trim-and-profiles-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/best-grit-sponges-for-trim-and-profiles-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/best-grit-sponges-for-trim-and-profiles-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/best-grit-sponges-for-trim-and-profiles-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/best-grit-sponges-for-trim-and-profiles-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/best-grit-sponges-for-trim-and-profiles-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/best-grit-sponges-for-trim-and-profiles-sanding-sponge/cards/instagram/best-grit-sponges-for-trim-and-profiles-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/best-grit-sponges-for-trim-and-profiles-sanding-sponge/cards/instagram/best-grit-sponges-for-trim-and-profiles-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/best-grit-sponges-for-trim-and-profiles-sanding-sponge/cards/instagram/best-grit-sponges-for-trim-and-profiles-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/best-grit-sponges-for-trim-and-profiles-sanding-sponge/cards/pinterest/best-grit-sponges-for-trim-and-profiles-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/best-grit-sponges-for-trim-and-profiles-sanding-sponge/cards/pinterest/best-grit-sponges-for-trim-and-profiles-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/best-grit-sponges-for-trim-and-profiles-sanding-sponge/cards/pinterest/best-grit-sponges-for-trim-and-profiles-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/best-grit-sponges-for-trim-and-profiles-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/best-grit-sponges-for-trim-and-profiles-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/best-grit-sponges-for-trim-and-profiles-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/best-grit-sponges-for-trim-and-profiles-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/best-grit-sponges-for-trim-and-profiles-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/best-grit-sponges-for-trim-and-profiles-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>When To Use Sanding Blocks Versus Bare Hand</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 02:57:35 +0000</pubDate><category>Sanding Blocks</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>sanding block</category><category>dry sanding</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Learn when to use a sanding block versus bare-hand sanding for flawless finishes.

&lt;p&gt;The first pass of the evening always tells you how the job will go. You clamp a pine shelf to the bench, switch on the task light, and run your fingertips across a coat of primer that’s not quite right—dust nibs, a few raised grain lines, a ridge where you filled a knot. The shop is quiet except for the small rasp of paper as you tear a new sheet. You think about reaching for your trusty sanding block, the one that’s squared a hundred edges and leveled just as many fills. Then you pause. The shelf has a soft, rounded front, and you can feel a subtle dip near the corner. A hard block might flatten more than you want. Your bare hand, wrapped around a fold of 320-grit, could trace the curve and polish it without flattening the profile.

&lt;p&gt;The porch rail felt like it had a story for every season—sun-baked summers, sleet-blown winters, and tenacious topcoats layered by different hands over the years. On a Saturday morning, coffee cooling on the steps, you press a thumbnail against the glossy surface and the film shears along a fracture line, curling up like a ribbon. It’s satisfying until it isn’t. Under the flake, there’s brittle alkyd over primer, over more alkyd, possibly over stain. You tug again. A chunk breaks free, revealing raw wood cross-grain scratches and a few resin pockets that never quite sealed. In that moment, the tactical argument—paint stripping vs sanding—stops being theoretical and turns into a process decision that will determine whether the new finish lasts or fails.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/01.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/22/hybrid-method-strip-first-then-sand-for-smooth-substrate-paint-stripping-vs-sand/cards/facebook/hybrid-method-strip-first-then-sand-for-smooth-substrate-paint-stripping-vs-sand.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/22/hybrid-method-strip-first-then-sand-for-smooth-substrate-paint-stripping-vs-sand/cards/facebook/hybrid-method-strip-first-then-sand-for-smooth-substrate-paint-stripping-vs-sand.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/22/hybrid-method-strip-first-then-sand-for-smooth-substrate-paint-stripping-vs-sand/cards/facebook/hybrid-method-strip-first-then-sand-for-smooth-substrate-paint-stripping-vs-sand.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/22/hybrid-method-strip-first-then-sand-for-smooth-substrate-paint-stripping-vs-sand/cards/instagram/hybrid-method-strip-first-then-sand-for-smooth-substrate-paint-stripping-vs-sand.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/22/hybrid-method-strip-first-then-sand-for-smooth-substrate-paint-stripping-vs-sand/cards/instagram/hybrid-method-strip-first-then-sand-for-smooth-substrate-paint-stripping-vs-sand.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/22/hybrid-method-strip-first-then-sand-for-smooth-substrate-paint-stripping-vs-sand/cards/instagram/hybrid-method-strip-first-then-sand-for-smooth-substrate-paint-stripping-vs-sand.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/22/hybrid-method-strip-first-then-sand-for-smooth-substrate-paint-stripping-vs-sand/cards/pinterest/hybrid-method-strip-first-then-sand-for-smooth-substrate-paint-stripping-vs-sand.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/22/hybrid-method-strip-first-then-sand-for-smooth-substrate-paint-stripping-vs-sand/cards/pinterest/hybrid-method-strip-first-then-sand-for-smooth-substrate-paint-stripping-vs-sand.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/22/hybrid-method-strip-first-then-sand-for-smooth-substrate-paint-stripping-vs-sand/cards/pinterest/hybrid-method-strip-first-then-sand-for-smooth-substrate-paint-stripping-vs-sand.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/22/hybrid-method-strip-first-then-sand-for-smooth-substrate-paint-stripping-vs-sand/cards/facebook/hybrid-method-strip-first-then-sand-for-smooth-substrate-paint-stripping-vs-sand.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/22/hybrid-method-strip-first-then-sand-for-smooth-substrate-paint-stripping-vs-sand/cards/facebook/hybrid-method-strip-first-then-sand-for-smooth-substrate-paint-stripping-vs-sand.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/22/hybrid-method-strip-first-then-sand-for-smooth-substrate-paint-stripping-vs-sand/cards/facebook/hybrid-method-strip-first-then-sand-for-smooth-substrate-paint-stripping-vs-sand.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>13</readingTime></item><item><title>Remove Elastomeric Coatings Using Scrape And Sand Workflow</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/05/remove-elastomeric-coatings-using-scrape-and-sand-workflow-coating-removal/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/05/remove-elastomeric-coatings-using-scrape-and-sand-workflow-coating-removal/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 15:01:19 +0000</pubDate><category>Paint Removal &amp; Surface Prep</category><category>paint prep</category><category>rust removal</category><category>primer coat</category><category>sanding block</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-220</category><category>dust control</category><description>Learn a precise scrape-and-sand workflow for elastomeric coating removal, with tools, techniques, safety, and prep tips for clean, recoat-ready surfaces.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="scrape-and-sand-coating-removal-for-elastomerics"&gt;Scrape-and-Sand Coating Removal for Elastomerics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first time you run a fingertip across a wall coated in elastomeric, it feels like certainty—thick, continuous, weather-tight. It’s the finish someone chose to stop hairline cracks from telegraphing through stucco, to keep a seaside breeze from pushing salt into masonry, or to stretch with a sunbaked metal panel. But years later, a new leak or peeling seam tells a different story: what once protected now needs to come off. If you’ve ever started a coating removal project and realized the job would fight you at every inch, you already know how elastic, stubborn films can turn a simple refresh into a craft exercise.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/14.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/05/remove-elastomeric-coatings-using-scrape-and-sand-workflow-coating-removal/cards/facebook/remove-elastomeric-coatings-using-scrape-and-sand-workflow-coating-removal.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/05/remove-elastomeric-coatings-using-scrape-and-sand-workflow-coating-removal/cards/facebook/remove-elastomeric-coatings-using-scrape-and-sand-workflow-coating-removal.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/05/remove-elastomeric-coatings-using-scrape-and-sand-workflow-coating-removal/cards/facebook/remove-elastomeric-coatings-using-scrape-and-sand-workflow-coating-removal.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/05/remove-elastomeric-coatings-using-scrape-and-sand-workflow-coating-removal/cards/instagram/remove-elastomeric-coatings-using-scrape-and-sand-workflow-coating-removal.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/05/remove-elastomeric-coatings-using-scrape-and-sand-workflow-coating-removal/cards/instagram/remove-elastomeric-coatings-using-scrape-and-sand-workflow-coating-removal.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/05/remove-elastomeric-coatings-using-scrape-and-sand-workflow-coating-removal/cards/instagram/remove-elastomeric-coatings-using-scrape-and-sand-workflow-coating-removal.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/05/remove-elastomeric-coatings-using-scrape-and-sand-workflow-coating-removal/cards/pinterest/remove-elastomeric-coatings-using-scrape-and-sand-workflow-coating-removal.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/05/remove-elastomeric-coatings-using-scrape-and-sand-workflow-coating-removal/cards/pinterest/remove-elastomeric-coatings-using-scrape-and-sand-workflow-coating-removal.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/05/remove-elastomeric-coatings-using-scrape-and-sand-workflow-coating-removal/cards/pinterest/remove-elastomeric-coatings-using-scrape-and-sand-workflow-coating-removal.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/05/remove-elastomeric-coatings-using-scrape-and-sand-workflow-coating-removal/cards/facebook/remove-elastomeric-coatings-using-scrape-and-sand-workflow-coating-removal.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/05/remove-elastomeric-coatings-using-scrape-and-sand-workflow-coating-removal/cards/facebook/remove-elastomeric-coatings-using-scrape-and-sand-workflow-coating-removal.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/05/remove-elastomeric-coatings-using-scrape-and-sand-workflow-coating-removal/cards/facebook/remove-elastomeric-coatings-using-scrape-and-sand-workflow-coating-removal.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>How To Achieve Paint Ready Wall Smoothness</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/03/how-to-achieve-paint-ready-wall-smoothness-wall-finishing/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/03/how-to-achieve-paint-ready-wall-smoothness-wall-finishing/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 14:09:46 +0000</pubDate><category>Drywall Sanding</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-800</category><category>dust control</category><category>joint compound</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>primer coat</category><description>Engineer-tested guide to wall finishing for paint-ready smoothness: compounds, abrasives, sanding systems, dust control, and pro tips to get flawless walls.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="wall-finishing-engineering-for-paint-ready-smoothness"&gt;Wall Finishing Engineering for Paint-Ready Smoothness&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It starts with a small annoyance that becomes impossible to unsee. Morning light slides across the living room, and suddenly the wall looks like a topographic map—shadows tracing joint lines, tiny ridges where rolled paint built up, shallow divots from a rushed patch job. You tilt your head, step closer, and feel the texture with your knuckles; the bumps catch. If you’ve been there, you also know the next moment: pulling tape off a fresh color sample and realizing the new paint only makes the unevenness louder. That’s the moment when wall finishing stops being cosmetic and becomes engineering. Smooth, paint-ready walls aren’t an accident. They’re the outcome of controlled materials, measured steps, and a willingness to test rather than guess.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/02.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/03/how-to-achieve-paint-ready-wall-smoothness-wall-finishing/cards/facebook/how-to-achieve-paint-ready-wall-smoothness-wall-finishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/03/how-to-achieve-paint-ready-wall-smoothness-wall-finishing/cards/facebook/how-to-achieve-paint-ready-wall-smoothness-wall-finishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/03/how-to-achieve-paint-ready-wall-smoothness-wall-finishing/cards/facebook/how-to-achieve-paint-ready-wall-smoothness-wall-finishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/03/how-to-achieve-paint-ready-wall-smoothness-wall-finishing/cards/instagram/how-to-achieve-paint-ready-wall-smoothness-wall-finishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/03/how-to-achieve-paint-ready-wall-smoothness-wall-finishing/cards/instagram/how-to-achieve-paint-ready-wall-smoothness-wall-finishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/03/how-to-achieve-paint-ready-wall-smoothness-wall-finishing/cards/instagram/how-to-achieve-paint-ready-wall-smoothness-wall-finishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/03/how-to-achieve-paint-ready-wall-smoothness-wall-finishing/cards/pinterest/how-to-achieve-paint-ready-wall-smoothness-wall-finishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/03/how-to-achieve-paint-ready-wall-smoothness-wall-finishing/cards/pinterest/how-to-achieve-paint-ready-wall-smoothness-wall-finishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/03/how-to-achieve-paint-ready-wall-smoothness-wall-finishing/cards/pinterest/how-to-achieve-paint-ready-wall-smoothness-wall-finishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/03/how-to-achieve-paint-ready-wall-smoothness-wall-finishing/cards/facebook/how-to-achieve-paint-ready-wall-smoothness-wall-finishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/03/how-to-achieve-paint-ready-wall-smoothness-wall-finishing/cards/facebook/how-to-achieve-paint-ready-wall-smoothness-wall-finishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/03/how-to-achieve-paint-ready-wall-smoothness-wall-finishing/cards/facebook/how-to-achieve-paint-ready-wall-smoothness-wall-finishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Clean And Degrease Surfaces Before Sanding And Priming</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/17/clean-and-degrease-surfaces-before-sanding-and-priming-surface-preparation/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/17/clean-and-degrease-surfaces-before-sanding-and-priming-surface-preparation/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jan 2026 13:34:08 +0000</pubDate><category>Paint Removal &amp; Surface Prep</category><category>paint prep</category><category>rust removal</category><category>primer coat</category><category>sanding block</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><description>Clean, degrease, then sand and prime like a pro.

&lt;p&gt;Saturday mornings in my shop start the same way: coffee steaming on the bench, drop cloths folded like fresh sails, and that itch to make something look and feel right. I’ve seen perfect paint jobs fail on day two because the prep was rushed. I’ve also watched tired cabinets come back to life simply because we took cleaning seriously. That’s the unglamorous truth of surface preparation: it separates the projects you brag about from the ones you avoid eye contact with.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/27.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/17/clean-and-degrease-surfaces-before-sanding-and-priming-surface-preparation/cards/facebook/clean-and-degrease-surfaces-before-sanding-and-priming-surface-preparation.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/17/clean-and-degrease-surfaces-before-sanding-and-priming-surface-preparation/cards/facebook/clean-and-degrease-surfaces-before-sanding-and-priming-surface-preparation.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/17/clean-and-degrease-surfaces-before-sanding-and-priming-surface-preparation/cards/facebook/clean-and-degrease-surfaces-before-sanding-and-priming-surface-preparation.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/17/clean-and-degrease-surfaces-before-sanding-and-priming-surface-preparation/cards/instagram/clean-and-degrease-surfaces-before-sanding-and-priming-surface-preparation.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/17/clean-and-degrease-surfaces-before-sanding-and-priming-surface-preparation/cards/instagram/clean-and-degrease-surfaces-before-sanding-and-priming-surface-preparation.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/17/clean-and-degrease-surfaces-before-sanding-and-priming-surface-preparation/cards/instagram/clean-and-degrease-surfaces-before-sanding-and-priming-surface-preparation.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/17/clean-and-degrease-surfaces-before-sanding-and-priming-surface-preparation/cards/pinterest/clean-and-degrease-surfaces-before-sanding-and-priming-surface-preparation.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/17/clean-and-degrease-surfaces-before-sanding-and-priming-surface-preparation/cards/pinterest/clean-and-degrease-surfaces-before-sanding-and-priming-surface-preparation.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/17/clean-and-degrease-surfaces-before-sanding-and-priming-surface-preparation/cards/pinterest/clean-and-degrease-surfaces-before-sanding-and-priming-surface-preparation.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/17/clean-and-degrease-surfaces-before-sanding-and-priming-surface-preparation/cards/facebook/clean-and-degrease-surfaces-before-sanding-and-priming-surface-preparation.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/17/clean-and-degrease-surfaces-before-sanding-and-priming-surface-preparation/cards/facebook/clean-and-degrease-surfaces-before-sanding-and-priming-surface-preparation.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/17/clean-and-degrease-surfaces-before-sanding-and-priming-surface-preparation/cards/facebook/clean-and-degrease-surfaces-before-sanding-and-priming-surface-preparation.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>How To Sand Old Paint Without Gouging The Substrate</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/28/how-to-sand-old-paint-without-gouging-the-substrate-paint-removal-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/28/how-to-sand-old-paint-without-gouging-the-substrate-paint-removal-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2025 13:35:01 +0000</pubDate><category>Paint Removal &amp; Surface Prep</category><category>paint prep</category><category>rust removal</category><category>primer coat</category><category>sanding block</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>dust control</category><description>Engineer-tested methods for paint removal sanding that strip coatings fast while protecting wood, plaster, fiberglass, and metal from gouges.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="paint-removal-sanding-without-substrate-damage"&gt;Paint Removal Sanding Without Substrate Damage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Saturday light came in low as I rolled the garage door open, coffee steaming on the bench and an old pine door leaning against a pair of horses. I’d painted it twice over the years and regretted both coats: drips along the panels, brush marks telegraphing in every direction, and an all-over chalkiness that made the hardware look fancier than the door deserved. I wanted a clean reset—bare wood, crisp edges, and a surface ready to take finish properly—but without the scars I’ve made in the past. If you’ve ever slipped with a sander and bitten into softwood or plaster, you know the sinking feeling. The goal this time: do the job with the precision of a machinist. For that, paint removal sanding would have to be deliberate, measurable, and controlled.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/11.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/28/how-to-sand-old-paint-without-gouging-the-substrate-paint-removal-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-old-paint-without-gouging-the-substrate-paint-removal-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/28/how-to-sand-old-paint-without-gouging-the-substrate-paint-removal-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-old-paint-without-gouging-the-substrate-paint-removal-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/28/how-to-sand-old-paint-without-gouging-the-substrate-paint-removal-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-old-paint-without-gouging-the-substrate-paint-removal-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/28/how-to-sand-old-paint-without-gouging-the-substrate-paint-removal-sanding/cards/instagram/how-to-sand-old-paint-without-gouging-the-substrate-paint-removal-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/28/how-to-sand-old-paint-without-gouging-the-substrate-paint-removal-sanding/cards/instagram/how-to-sand-old-paint-without-gouging-the-substrate-paint-removal-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/28/how-to-sand-old-paint-without-gouging-the-substrate-paint-removal-sanding/cards/instagram/how-to-sand-old-paint-without-gouging-the-substrate-paint-removal-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/28/how-to-sand-old-paint-without-gouging-the-substrate-paint-removal-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-to-sand-old-paint-without-gouging-the-substrate-paint-removal-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/28/how-to-sand-old-paint-without-gouging-the-substrate-paint-removal-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-to-sand-old-paint-without-gouging-the-substrate-paint-removal-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/28/how-to-sand-old-paint-without-gouging-the-substrate-paint-removal-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-to-sand-old-paint-without-gouging-the-substrate-paint-removal-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/28/how-to-sand-old-paint-without-gouging-the-substrate-paint-removal-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-old-paint-without-gouging-the-substrate-paint-removal-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/28/how-to-sand-old-paint-without-gouging-the-substrate-paint-removal-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-old-paint-without-gouging-the-substrate-paint-removal-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/28/how-to-sand-old-paint-without-gouging-the-substrate-paint-removal-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-old-paint-without-gouging-the-substrate-paint-removal-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Epa Rrp Containment Setup For Lead Paint Sanding</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 15:44:17 +0000</pubDate><category>Paint Removal &amp; Surface Prep</category><category>paint prep</category><category>rust removal</category><category>primer coat</category><category>sanding block</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><description>A technical guide to EPA RRP containment for lead-safe sanding, covering surface prep, abrasive selection, HEPA capture, and low-dust workflows.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="epa-rrp-containment-for-lead-safe-sanding"&gt;EPA RRP Containment for Lead-Safe Sanding&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a moment, right before the sander touches the surface, when a room holds its breath. You’ve taped the vents, rolled up area rugs, shuffled furniture to the hallway. In an older home—maybe one built just after the war, with trim thick enough to show paint strata like tree rings—you feel the weight of history in the baseboards and widow’s walk. You also feel responsibility. Dust is memory made airborne, and when that dust contains lead, it crosses the boundary from nuisance to long-term health hazard in seconds. The job becomes less about “cleaning up later” and more about “controlling everything now.” That’s precisely where epa rrp containment setup lives, and it’s the fulcrum between craftsmanship and care.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/24.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding/cards/facebook/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding/cards/facebook/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding/cards/facebook/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding/cards/instagram/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding/cards/instagram/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding/cards/instagram/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding/cards/pinterest/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding/cards/pinterest/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding/cards/pinterest/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding/cards/facebook/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding/cards/facebook/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/09/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding/cards/facebook/epa-rrp-containment-setup-for-lead-paint-sanding-lead-safe-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Smooth Fairing Compound Before Primer</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/02/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/02/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 02 Dec 2025 13:43:25 +0000</pubDate><category>Marine Sanding</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>dry sanding</category><category>primer coat</category><description>Master boat sanding and fairing for a glass-smooth base before primer.

&lt;p&gt;You can hear it before you see it: the soft rasp of paper across gelcoat, the shush-shush rhythm that turns a scuffed hull into something you can be proud of. Boat sanding isn’t exactly glamorous, but on a still morning—coffee perched on a dock post, gulls trading gossip overhead—it feels like craft. Your fingers become the first inspectors, gliding across highs and lows. The goal isn’t just clean; it’s consistent. When you’re aiming for smooth fairing compound before primer, you’re making a commitment to what comes next: paint that lays down like glass, reflections that don’t ripple, and time on the water that starts sooner because you did the prep right.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/19.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/02/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/02/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/02/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/02/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding/cards/instagram/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/02/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding/cards/instagram/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/02/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding/cards/instagram/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/02/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding/cards/pinterest/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/02/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding/cards/pinterest/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/02/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding/cards/pinterest/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/02/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/02/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/02/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding/cards/facebook/smooth-fairing-compound-before-primer-boat-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>When To Choose Chemical Stripping Instead Of Sanding</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 13:38:25 +0000</pubDate><category>Paint Removal &amp; Surface Prep</category><category>paint prep</category><category>rust removal</category><category>primer coat</category><category>sanding block</category><category>orbital sander</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Learn when chemical stripping beats sanding.

&lt;p&gt;You can hear a project before you see it: the whine of an orbital sander, the hiss of a dust extractor, the rasp of grit carving tracks in an old finish. The other soundtrack is a quiet shop, drop cloths taped down, a gelled stripper turning tired paint into ribbons under a plastic scraper. Both are valid approaches to surface preparation, and the results hinge on choosing the right path at the outset. The paint stripping vs sanding decision is less about preference and more about material science, coating behavior, and the downstream finish you expect. If you’re staring at a five-layer porch rail, a veneered dresser, or a fiberglass hatch, the fastest route to a clean, profile-ready surface may not be the one you think.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/10.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding/cards/instagram/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding/cards/instagram/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding/cards/instagram/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding/cards/pinterest/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding/cards/pinterest/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding/cards/pinterest/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/24/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding/cards/facebook/when-to-choose-chemical-stripping-instead-of-sanding-paint-stripping-vs-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Strip Failing Polyurethane Then Sand Residue Before Refinishing</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 13:37:09 +0000</pubDate><category>Paint Removal &amp; Surface Prep</category><category>paint prep</category><category>rust removal</category><category>primer coat</category><category>sanding block</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-1500</category><description>Learn expert steps for coating removal, sanding residue, and refinishing wood for durable, beautiful results with safe methods, tools, and pro tips.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="coating-removal-and-refinishing-failing-polyurethane"&gt;Coating Removal and Refinishing Failing Polyurethane&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning light spilled across the dining table you’ve hosted around for years. You set down a mug and notice the surface clings just a little; a ring remains, faint but stubborn. Along the edges, the once-smooth finish has turned brittle and chalky, tiny flakes catching the light like dust motes in motion. You run a fingertip across the spot where a placemat lives—glossy here, dull there, with a subtle ridge between. The finish is failing, and it’s happening faster than you’d like. You can feel the stakes: this is not just a table—it’s family dinners, late-night projects, first-day-of-school photos, and the clean expanse that makes a home feel ready.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/23.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal/cards/facebook/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal/cards/facebook/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal/cards/facebook/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal/cards/instagram/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal/cards/instagram/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal/cards/instagram/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal/cards/pinterest/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal/cards/pinterest/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal/cards/pinterest/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal/cards/facebook/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal/cards/facebook/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/12/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal/cards/facebook/strip-failing-polyurethane-then-sand-residue-before-refinishing-coating-removal.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Scuff Sand Glossy Paint To Improve Primer Adhesion</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 05 Nov 2025 04:18:59 +0000</pubDate><category>Paint Removal &amp; Surface Prep</category><category>paint prep</category><category>rust removal</category><category>primer coat</category><category>sanding block</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>dust control</category><description>Learn how to scuff sand glossy paint for superior primer adhesion.

&lt;p&gt;There’s a moment every DIYer knows: coffee in hand, paint tray loaded, roller whispering across the wall—and then the dreaded slip. The glossy trim or cabinet door you thought you tamed suddenly sheds the new coat like a rain jacket, beading, sliding, or peeling on touch. I’ve been in that room more times than I can count, from weekend bathrooms to full commercial corridors, and the conclusion’s always the same—before color comes control. That control starts with surface preparation. Not flashy, not glamorous, but it’s the one step that makes every coat after it look better and last longer.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation/cards/facebook/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation/cards/facebook/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation/cards/facebook/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation/cards/instagram/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation/cards/instagram/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation/cards/instagram/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation/cards/pinterest/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation/cards/pinterest/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation/cards/pinterest/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation/cards/facebook/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation/cards/facebook/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation/cards/facebook/scuff-sand-glossy-paint-to-improve-primer-adhesion-surface-preparation.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>How To Sand Crown Molding Profiles Without Flattening</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 04 Nov 2025 16:44:08 +0000</pubDate><category>Trim &amp; Molding Sanding</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>sanding block</category><category>primer coat</category><category>dust control</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Learn how to sand crown molding without flattening profiles.

&lt;p&gt;On a quiet Saturday morning, you finally pull the drop cloths over your living room floor and tilt a lamp toward the ceiling. The crown molding looks elegant from a distance, but up close the paint has chipped at the corners and the once-crisp beads have gone a little blurry. You run a fingertip along a cove that should feel like a clean arc, and instead it’s a soft bump. That’s the moment when most DIYers decide to sand—and the moment many profiles lose their sharp character. The goal isn’t to erase the molding’s shape; it’s to refine the surface. With a thoughtful approach to molding sanding, you can keep each flare, bead, and cove true while preparing for a flawless new finish.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding/cards/instagram/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding/cards/instagram/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding/cards/instagram/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>What Grit To Remove Peeling Paint From Wood Trim</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/what-grit-to-remove-peeling-paint-from-wood-trim-paint-removal-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/what-grit-to-remove-peeling-paint-from-wood-trim-paint-removal-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 00:03:42 +0000</pubDate><category>Paint Removal &amp; Surface Prep</category><category>paint prep</category><category>rust removal</category><category>primer coat</category><category>sanding block</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><description>Discover expert tips on paint removal sanding for wood trim.

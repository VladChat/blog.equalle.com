&lt;p&gt;The first time I tried to sand a maple tabletop in my small garage, I didn’t plan for the dust. Within minutes, a visible cloud hovered over my workbench, the air had that chalky taste, and the light from the door turned into a foggy beam. The sander did its job, but the shop felt uninhabitable. Fast-forward to today, and my setup looks completely different: a quiet extractor hums under the bench, a smooth-bore hose clips into a sander with a snug port connection, and the cleanup is mostly emptying a bag. The shift to dustless sanding wasn’t just about comfort—it was about control. Once you understand how hose diameter, hose length, and vacuum performance interact, you can tune a system that captures chips and submicron dust instead of aerosolizing it.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>How Long To Wait Before Sanding Joint Compound</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-long-to-wait-before-sanding-joint-compound-joint-compound-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-long-to-wait-before-sanding-joint-compound-joint-compound-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 04 Nov 2025 17:23:25 +0000</pubDate><category>Drywall Sanding</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>joint compound</category><category>dust control</category><description>Learn precise wait times, drying variables, and pro sanding workflows to prevent gouges and dust when sanding joint compound.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="how-long-to-wait-for-joint-compound-sanding"&gt;How Long to Wait for Joint Compound Sanding&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s 10:47 p.m. You’ve spent the evening in a quiet room, spreading thin, even passes of mud across seams that once shadowed your drywall. The lights are low; the blade marks are almost gone. You resist the urge to sand right now because experience whispers that impatience leads to rework. The air smells faintly of gypsum and paint primer, and the walls look nearly finished—but the clock matters more than appearances. Joint compound sanding isn’t just a step; it’s the inflection point between a surface that telegraphs flaws under paint and one that disappears behind a flawless finish.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Best Grit For Drywall Sanding Before Paint</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/02/best-grit-for-drywall-sanding-before-paint-drywall-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/02/best-grit-for-drywall-sanding-before-paint-drywall-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 02 Nov 2025 20:40:05 +0000</pubDate><category>Drywall Sanding</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>dust control</category><category>joint compound</category><category>sanding block</category><description>Discover expert tips and best practices for drywall sanding to achieve a perfect paint-ready surface.

&lt;p&gt;There’s something incredibly satisfying about transforming a raw, uneven drywall surface into a smooth, pristine canvas ready for a fresh coat of paint. Picture this: you’ve just finished a long day at work, but instead of collapsing on the couch, you step into your garage, grab your sanding tools, and lose yourself in the rhythmic motion of perfecting your drywall. The hum of the sander drowns out the day’s stress, and as each layer of dust falls, so too does the weight of your worries.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><readingTime>6</readingTime></item></channel></rss>

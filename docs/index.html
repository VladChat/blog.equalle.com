In my shop, that moment usually happens late on a Saturday—coffee gone cool, bench lights warmed up, and the plate glass on my bench wearing a fresh sheet of microfinishing film. I keep two bottles nearby: one filled with water and a drop of dish soap, the other with a light mineral oil. They aren’t just liquids—they’re decisions. Each one pushes the work in a different direction.</p><p class=post-card-meta>January 26, 2026 · 12 min read · by Lucas Moreno</p></a></article><article class=post-card><a href=https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/25/squeegee-check-to-read-leveling-progress-wet-dry-sandpaper/><div class=post-card-category>Waterproof & Wet/Dry Paper</div><h2 class=post-card-title>Squeegee Check To Read Leveling Progress</h2><p class=post-card-summary>Master squeegee checks with wet dry sandpaper Saturday morning, garage door up, the fender you sprayed last night looks flawless—until you bring it into raking light. The orange-peel you thought you’d erased is still there, just softened by gloss and optimism. You fill a spray bottle, tear off a square of waterproof abrasive, and start working methodically. A few strokes in, the pad feels consistent—no sudden grab, no chatter—just a soft, damp hiss. You pause, reach for a silicone squeegee, and draw a single pass across the panel. The water evacuates, leaving a thin, revealing film. High spots flash glossy first, low spots stay matte. The map of your progress appears in an instant.</p><p class=post-card-meta>January 25, 2026 · 13 min read · by David Chen</p></a></article><article class=post-card><a href=https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/25/ceramic-belts-for-aggressive-stock-removal-ceramic-sanding-discs/><div class=post-card-category>Ceramic & Premium Abrasives</div><h2 class=post-card-title>Ceramic Belts For Aggressive Stock Removal</h2><p class=post-card-summary>Ceramic Sanding Discs vs Belts for Aggressive Removal The shop is quiet in that way only early morning makes possible—dust settled, machines cold, bench light slicing through the dim. The billet you rough cut last night is still blued along the waterjet edge, and there’s a faint scorch on a hardwood panel you’d rather not talk about. You pick up a fresh belt, flick the grinder to life, and feel the familiar rise in pitch as the drive wheel spins up. This is where ceramic belts earn their keep. They chew, not smear. Under controlled pressure, they self-fracture into sharp edges, pushing material off the part instead of heat into it. If you’ve ever stepped from dull aluminum oxide to a modern ceramic belt, you know the feeling—a sudden, almost startling increase in cut. Later, when you pivot to flatten with a sander, ceramic sanding discs provide the same microfracturing advantage, but with dust extraction and a controlled scratch field better suited to broad surfaces.</p><p class=post-card-meta>January 25, 2026 · 11 min read · by Mark Jensen</p></a></article><article class=post-card><a href=https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/24/grit-changes-for-water-based-finishes-sandpaper-grit/><div class=post-card-category>Grit Range & Classification</div><h2 class=post-card-title>Grit Changes For Water Based Finishes</h2><p class=post-card-summary>Sandpaper Grit for Water-Based Finishes You run a hand across the tabletop you’ve been refinishing, and it feels… almost right. The color looks clean, and the first coat of water-based polyurethane flashes off in minutes. But when you turn your head, you see tiny scratches that weren’t there before. The surface feels slightly fuzzy, as if the grain has lifted. You wonder whether your sandpaper grit was too fine, too coarse, or used at the wrong time. You think about starting over—again—but what if the solution is simply understanding how grit choices change when your finish is water-based?</p><p class=post-card-meta>January 24, 2026 · 10 min read · by Emily Novak</p></a></article><article class=post-card><a href=https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/24/belts-discs-and-sheets-grit-mapping-sandpaper-grit-chart/><div class=post-card-category>Grit Guide & Education</div><h2 class=post-card-title>Belts Discs And Sheets Grit Mapping</h2><p class=post-card-summary>Sandpaper Grit Chart: Belts, Discs, and Sheets Mapping It always starts with a surface and a feeling. Maybe it’s the kitchen table that’s seen holiday spills, or the fender you’ve been meaning to fix, or a maple cutting board you want to make heirloom-smooth. You run your hand across it and feel the story: dents here, scratches there, a patch of stubborn paint that won’t let go. That’s the moment I reach for a notepad, not the sander. Why? Because every great finish begins on paper—specifically, with a sandpaper grit chart. If you’ve ever jumped into sanding and ended with swirl marks, burn-through, or “Why does this still look cloudy?”, the solution wasn’t more pressure or more time. It was a better map.</p><p class=post-card-meta>January 24, 2026 · 12 min read · by Lucas Moreno</p></a></article><article class=post-card><a href=https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/23/wet-sanding-options-to-minimize-airborne-dust-dustless-sanding/><div class=post-card-category>Dust Extraction Systems</div><h2 class=post-card-title>Wet Sanding Options To Minimize Airborne Dust</h2><p class=post-card-summary>Wet Methods for Dustless Sanding Indoors On a quiet Saturday, I watched sunbeams pick up a blizzard of drywall dust in a small, lived‑in apartment. The hallway was taped for paint, a crib sat two doors down, and a stack of sandpaper waited on the drop cloth. Every swipe of a sanding pole cast more white into the air. The homeowner—mask on, windows open—was doing their best, but dust still found a way into the return vents and the closets. I’ve worked in labs and on job sites long enough to know that dust damage isn’t just aesthetic; it creeps into electronics, triggers allergies, and lingers in HVAC systems for months. The question that matters to families and contractors alike becomes practical, not theoretical: can we keep the surface quality high while keeping the air clean?</p><p class=post-card-meta>January 23, 2026 · 12 min read · by David Chen</p></a></article><article class=post-card><a href=https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/22/match-pad-hole-pattern-to-disc-for-suction-sander-interface-pad/><div class=post-card-category>Interface Pads & Backing Pads</div><h2 class=post-card-title>Match Pad Hole Pattern To Disc For Suction</h2><p class=post-card-summary>Optimize Dust Extraction with a Sander Interface Pad The morning a project turns from anxious to assured often starts with a small decision. You roll up the shop door, the air still cool, and stare at a tabletop whose grain promises more than your last pass delivered. Yesterday, dust swirled despite the extractor, paper loaded early, and faint swirl marks telegraphed through the finish like regrets. Today you commit to variables you can actually control: matching the pad’s hole pattern to your abrasive disc, adjusting your extractor, and adding a purpose-built sander interface pad to tune contact pressure and airflow. The hum of the sander builds; the extractor throttles on; a faint draft kisses the work surface through the perforations. You feel the pad land—not slap—against the wood, compliant enough to fold into crowns and edges but firm enough to maintain a flat across panels.</p><p class=post-card-meta>January 22, 2026 · 11 min read · by Mark Jensen</p></a></article><article class=post-card><a href=https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/21/avoid-tearing-discs-during-removal-psa-sanding-discs/><div class=post-card-category>PSA Discs</div><h2 class=post-card-title>Avoid Tearing Discs During Removal</h2><p class=post-card-summary>PSA Sanding Discs: How to Avoid Tearing on Removal The workshop is quiet except for the slow tick of a cooling motor. You’ve just eased the last pass across a maple tabletop—grain shimmering, edges crisp—and the surface looks ready for finish. Then comes the moment that always feels a little precarious: peeling off the sanding disc. You pinch the edge, pull, and hear that dreaded sound—a papery snap with a gummy sigh—followed by a ragged crescent of disc left clinging to the pad. The rhythm breaks, your heart sinks, and out comes the putty knife and solvent. It doesn’t have to be this way.</p><p class=post-card-meta>January 21, 2026 · 12 min read · by Emily Novak</p></a></article><article class=post-card><a href=https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/21/psa-versus-hook-and-loop-disc-differences-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/><div class=post-card-category>Hook-and-Loop Discs</div><h2 class=post-card-title>Psa Versus Hook And Loop Disc Differences</h2><p class=post-card-summary>PSA vs hook and loop sanding discs explained The first time I watched a sanding disc leave the pad at full RPM, it was a fresh cup of coffee and a maple tabletop on the line. I’d been stepping through grits—80, 120, 150—chasing that clean, even scratch pattern before dye. Then the shop warmed up, the workpiece warmed up, and my backing pad warmed up. Ten minutes later, the disc glazed, heat built, and off it went—cartwheeling into a cardboard box like a frisbee with a grudge. That day taught me that backing matters as much as grit. If you’ve ever fought adhesive smears from a PSA disc or melted hooks that won’t grip, you already know the stakes. The choice between PSA and hook and loop sanding discs isn’t academic; it’s about finish quality, workflow speed, and how many discs you burn through to get a surface you’re proud of.</p><p class=post-card-meta>January 21, 2026 · 10 min read · by Lucas Moreno</p></a></article><article class=post-card><a href=https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/21/prevent-clogging-on-resinous-woods-sanding-belts/><div class=post-card-category>Sanding Belts & Machines</div><h2 class=post-card-title>Prevent Clogging On Resinous Woods</h2><p class=post-card-summary>Stop Clogging on Resinous Woods with Sanding Belts The first time I tried to tame a stack of knotty Southern yellow pine, I thought new sanding belts would be my shortcut to a glassy finish. The shop smelled like turpentine and warm sugar—pitch warming in the fibers—and the belt sander sounded confident until the tone changed. Within minutes, cut rate fell off a cliff. The abrasive looked frosted in amber: a mosaic of resin streaks and smeared dust welded into the grit. I slowed my feed, pressed harder, and just made more heat. The belt polished rather than cut; the workpiece glazed. I swapped belts, only to watch the next one load just as fast.</p><p class=post-card-meta>January 21, 2026 · 13 min read · by David Chen</p></a></article></div><nav class=pagination><a class="prev disabled">« Prev</a>

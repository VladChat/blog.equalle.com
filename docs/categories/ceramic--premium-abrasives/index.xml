&lt;p&gt;I still remember the first time I had to prep eight maple drawer fronts and two weldments on a Friday night, trying to get everything out the door before a client walk-through. The random orbital ran steady, but the pace was brutal: discs glazed, edges burned, and I found myself swapping aluminum oxide sheets every few minutes. The bin filled up with used paper; the floor filled with dust. It felt like death by a thousand micro-clogs. That night I started running side-by-side trials with ceramic sanding discs. I wanted to know if the higher sticker price was justified or just clever marketing.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/13.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/11/cost-per-job-comparison-ceramic-vs-ao-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/cost-per-job-comparison-ceramic-vs-ao-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/11/cost-per-job-comparison-ceramic-vs-ao-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/cost-per-job-comparison-ceramic-vs-ao-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/11/cost-per-job-comparison-ceramic-vs-ao-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/cost-per-job-comparison-ceramic-vs-ao-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/11/cost-per-job-comparison-ceramic-vs-ao-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/cost-per-job-comparison-ceramic-vs-ao-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/11/cost-per-job-comparison-ceramic-vs-ao-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/cost-per-job-comparison-ceramic-vs-ao-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/11/cost-per-job-comparison-ceramic-vs-ao-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/cost-per-job-comparison-ceramic-vs-ao-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/11/cost-per-job-comparison-ceramic-vs-ao-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/cost-per-job-comparison-ceramic-vs-ao-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/11/cost-per-job-comparison-ceramic-vs-ao-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/cost-per-job-comparison-ceramic-vs-ao-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/11/cost-per-job-comparison-ceramic-vs-ao-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/cost-per-job-comparison-ceramic-vs-ao-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/11/cost-per-job-comparison-ceramic-vs-ao-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/cost-per-job-comparison-ceramic-vs-ao-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/11/cost-per-job-comparison-ceramic-vs-ao-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/cost-per-job-comparison-ceramic-vs-ao-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/11/cost-per-job-comparison-ceramic-vs-ao-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/cost-per-job-comparison-ceramic-vs-ao-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Ceramic Belts For Aggressive Stock Removal</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/25/ceramic-belts-for-aggressive-stock-removal-ceramic-sanding-discs/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/25/ceramic-belts-for-aggressive-stock-removal-ceramic-sanding-discs/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 13:38:02 +0000</pubDate><category>Ceramic &amp; Premium Abrasives</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit progression</category><category>orbital sander</category><category>dust control</category><description>Ceramic belts for fast stock removal, plus when ceramic sanding discs outperform.

&lt;p&gt;The shop is quiet in that way only early morning makes possible—dust settled, machines cold, bench light slicing through the dim. The billet you rough cut last night is still blued along the waterjet edge, and there’s a faint scorch on a hardwood panel you’d rather not talk about. You pick up a fresh belt, flick the grinder to life, and feel the familiar rise in pitch as the drive wheel spins up. This is where ceramic belts earn their keep. They chew, not smear. Under controlled pressure, they self-fracture into sharp edges, pushing material off the part instead of heat into it. If you’ve ever stepped from dull aluminum oxide to a modern ceramic belt, you know the feeling—a sudden, almost startling increase in cut. Later, when you pivot to flatten with a sander, ceramic sanding discs provide the same microfracturing advantage, but with dust extraction and a controlled scratch field better suited to broad surfaces.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/26.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/25/ceramic-belts-for-aggressive-stock-removal-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/ceramic-belts-for-aggressive-stock-removal-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/25/ceramic-belts-for-aggressive-stock-removal-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/ceramic-belts-for-aggressive-stock-removal-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/25/ceramic-belts-for-aggressive-stock-removal-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/ceramic-belts-for-aggressive-stock-removal-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/25/ceramic-belts-for-aggressive-stock-removal-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/ceramic-belts-for-aggressive-stock-removal-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/25/ceramic-belts-for-aggressive-stock-removal-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/ceramic-belts-for-aggressive-stock-removal-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/25/ceramic-belts-for-aggressive-stock-removal-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/ceramic-belts-for-aggressive-stock-removal-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/25/ceramic-belts-for-aggressive-stock-removal-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/ceramic-belts-for-aggressive-stock-removal-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/25/ceramic-belts-for-aggressive-stock-removal-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/ceramic-belts-for-aggressive-stock-removal-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/25/ceramic-belts-for-aggressive-stock-removal-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/ceramic-belts-for-aggressive-stock-removal-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/25/ceramic-belts-for-aggressive-stock-removal-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/ceramic-belts-for-aggressive-stock-removal-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/25/ceramic-belts-for-aggressive-stock-removal-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/ceramic-belts-for-aggressive-stock-removal-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/25/ceramic-belts-for-aggressive-stock-removal-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/ceramic-belts-for-aggressive-stock-removal-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Film Backed Ceramics For Uniform Scratch</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jan 2026 15:06:46 +0000</pubDate><category>Ceramic &amp; Premium Abrasives</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-280</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>dust control</category><category>clear coat</category><description>Learn how film-backed ceramic sanding discs deliver a uniform scratch pattern with better cut and control.

&lt;p&gt;You notice it first in the light. That telltale halo that appears when you shift the panel under a shop lamp, the swirl that refuses to quit even after another pass with the sander. Maybe it’s a cabinet door you’ve been nursing back to life, a car fender in primer that has to be perfect for color, or a guitar body on its third clear coat. You’re not chasing shine yet—you’re chasing uniformity. A clean, even scratch pattern is the quiet foundation of every flawless finish, and when it isn’t there, everything downstream becomes harder: filler prints through, paint mottles, topcoats telegraph the tiniest inconsistencies. The solution often starts earlier than we think—at the abrasive itself.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/10.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/03/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/film-backed-ceramics-for-uniform-scratch-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Pressure And Speed Settings For Ceramics</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/16/pressure-and-speed-settings-for-ceramics-ceramic-sanding-discs/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/16/pressure-and-speed-settings-for-ceramics-ceramic-sanding-discs/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 13:44:59 +0000</pubDate><category>Ceramic &amp; Premium Abrasives</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-320</category><category>dust control</category><category>wet sanding</category><description>Learn pro-level pressure and speed settings for ceramics using ceramic sanding discs, with step-by-step methods, tips, and troubleshooting.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="ceramic-sanding-discs-pressure-and-speed-guide"&gt;Ceramic Sanding Discs: Pressure and Speed Guide&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Late Saturday, the shop was warm and humming when a customer walked in with a chipped porcelain threshold. “One wrong pass,” he sighed, pointing at the glossy edge that now had a small bite missing. I recognized it immediately: too much speed, too much pressure, and a disc that glazed over before it could cut clean. I’ve been there—on driftwood, on aluminum, and yes, on ceramic tile where heat and hard grains make every mistake loud and permanent. That’s why pressure and speed matter more with ceramics than almost any other material. Ceramic is unforgiving. The wrong setting with ceramic sanding discs can burnish instead of cut, spike temperatures, and cause micro-cracking or edge blowouts you won’t see until the grout goes in.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/23.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/16/pressure-and-speed-settings-for-ceramics-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/pressure-and-speed-settings-for-ceramics-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/16/pressure-and-speed-settings-for-ceramics-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/pressure-and-speed-settings-for-ceramics-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/16/pressure-and-speed-settings-for-ceramics-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/pressure-and-speed-settings-for-ceramics-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/16/pressure-and-speed-settings-for-ceramics-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/pressure-and-speed-settings-for-ceramics-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/16/pressure-and-speed-settings-for-ceramics-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/pressure-and-speed-settings-for-ceramics-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/16/pressure-and-speed-settings-for-ceramics-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/pressure-and-speed-settings-for-ceramics-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/16/pressure-and-speed-settings-for-ceramics-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/pressure-and-speed-settings-for-ceramics-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/16/pressure-and-speed-settings-for-ceramics-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/pressure-and-speed-settings-for-ceramics-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/16/pressure-and-speed-settings-for-ceramics-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/pressure-and-speed-settings-for-ceramics-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/16/pressure-and-speed-settings-for-ceramics-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/pressure-and-speed-settings-for-ceramics-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/16/pressure-and-speed-settings-for-ceramics-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/pressure-and-speed-settings-for-ceramics-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/16/pressure-and-speed-settings-for-ceramics-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/pressure-and-speed-settings-for-ceramics-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Pair Ceramics With Dust Extraction</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/29/pair-ceramics-with-dust-extraction-ceramic-sanding-discs/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/29/pair-ceramics-with-dust-extraction-ceramic-sanding-discs/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 29 Nov 2025 13:31:32 +0000</pubDate><category>Ceramic &amp; Premium Abrasives</category><category>grit-400</category><description>Engineer-tested guide to pairing ceramic sanding discs with dust extraction for cleaner air, longer disc life, and faster, cooler cuts on wood, metal, and</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="ceramic-sanding-discs-and-dust-extraction-guide"&gt;Ceramic Sanding Discs and Dust Extraction Guide&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s 7:10 p.m. in the garage, and you’re chasing the last coat-leveling pass on a maple tabletop. The light catches a swirl here, a rough patch there—and a cloud of fine dust that you don’t fully register until the sharp smell of lignin and heat hits. You stop to wipe your safety glasses, but the haze hangs on. The disc feels glazed, the sander runs hotter, and progress slows. I’ve been there dozens of times. Switching to a better abrasive helps, but the real unlock came when I paired high-performance ceramic sanding discs with a properly tuned dust extraction setup. The first night I dialed it in, the air stayed clear, the finish looked even, and my disc cut like it was fresh—for far longer than I expected.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/07.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/29/pair-ceramics-with-dust-extraction-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/pair-ceramics-with-dust-extraction-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/29/pair-ceramics-with-dust-extraction-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/pair-ceramics-with-dust-extraction-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/29/pair-ceramics-with-dust-extraction-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/pair-ceramics-with-dust-extraction-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/29/pair-ceramics-with-dust-extraction-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/pair-ceramics-with-dust-extraction-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/29/pair-ceramics-with-dust-extraction-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/pair-ceramics-with-dust-extraction-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/29/pair-ceramics-with-dust-extraction-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/pair-ceramics-with-dust-extraction-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/29/pair-ceramics-with-dust-extraction-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/pair-ceramics-with-dust-extraction-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/29/pair-ceramics-with-dust-extraction-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/pair-ceramics-with-dust-extraction-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/29/pair-ceramics-with-dust-extraction-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/pair-ceramics-with-dust-extraction-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/29/pair-ceramics-with-dust-extraction-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/pair-ceramics-with-dust-extraction-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/29/pair-ceramics-with-dust-extraction-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/pair-ceramics-with-dust-extraction-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/29/pair-ceramics-with-dust-extraction-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/pair-ceramics-with-dust-extraction-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Reduced Heat And Loading On Tough Materials</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/16/reduced-heat-and-loading-on-tough-materials-ceramic-sanding-discs/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/16/reduced-heat-and-loading-on-tough-materials-ceramic-sanding-discs/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 16 Nov 2025 13:30:01 +0000</pubDate><category>Ceramic &amp; Premium Abrasives</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-180</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>Engineer-tested review of ceramic sanding discs—how they cut cooler, resist loading, and last longer on stainless, hardwoods, and composites.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="ceramic-sanding-discs-for-cooler-cleaner-cuts"&gt;Ceramic Sanding Discs for Cooler, Cleaner Cuts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Late on a Saturday, the garage hums like a small factory. The goal is modest—deburr a few stainless brackets, flatten a maple cutting board, and knock down drips on a fiberglass canoe repair—but the reality is a stack of spent discs, a hot sander, and surfaces that look worse with every pass. You can smell scorched wood and feel the sander dragging as the face clogs with resin and dust. The disc you just installed is already glazed. It’s the kind of session that makes you wonder if sanding is a test of patience rather than a controllable, measurable process.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/22.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/16/reduced-heat-and-loading-on-tough-materials-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/reduced-heat-and-loading-on-tough-materials-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/16/reduced-heat-and-loading-on-tough-materials-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/reduced-heat-and-loading-on-tough-materials-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/16/reduced-heat-and-loading-on-tough-materials-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/reduced-heat-and-loading-on-tough-materials-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/16/reduced-heat-and-loading-on-tough-materials-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/reduced-heat-and-loading-on-tough-materials-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/16/reduced-heat-and-loading-on-tough-materials-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/reduced-heat-and-loading-on-tough-materials-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/16/reduced-heat-and-loading-on-tough-materials-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/reduced-heat-and-loading-on-tough-materials-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/16/reduced-heat-and-loading-on-tough-materials-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/reduced-heat-and-loading-on-tough-materials-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/16/reduced-heat-and-loading-on-tough-materials-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/reduced-heat-and-loading-on-tough-materials-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/16/reduced-heat-and-loading-on-tough-materials-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/reduced-heat-and-loading-on-tough-materials-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/16/reduced-heat-and-loading-on-tough-materials-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/reduced-heat-and-loading-on-tough-materials-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/16/reduced-heat-and-loading-on-tough-materials-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/reduced-heat-and-loading-on-tough-materials-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/16/reduced-heat-and-loading-on-tough-materials-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/reduced-heat-and-loading-on-tough-materials-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Longer Life Versus Standard Abrasives</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/longer-life-versus-standard-abrasives-ceramic-sanding-discs/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/longer-life-versus-standard-abrasives-ceramic-sanding-discs/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 07 Nov 2025 13:31:19 +0000</pubDate><category>Ceramic &amp; Premium Abrasives</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-360</category><category>dust control</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Compare ceramic sanding discs to standard abrasives, with actionable setup tips, workflows, and cost math to extend life and elevate surface quality.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="ceramic-sanding-discs-vs-standard-longer-life"&gt;Ceramic sanding discs vs standard: longer life&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dust collector hummed like a steady metronome as Marcus leaned into the oak tabletop, fighting a familiar battle against swirl marks and rising heat. He’d already burned through three conventional discs by mid-afternoon, each one cutting hard for a minute and then fading into a smear of loading and noise. With dinner guests arriving at seven and the table still scarred from yesterday’s router tear-out, frustration felt inevitable. His phone chimed: a colleague’s message, short and to the point—“Try ceramic sanding discs. Run lighter pressure. Keep it moving.” He shrugged, swapped the pad, and clipped on a mesh-backed ceramic disc he’d picked up on a whim.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/longer-life-versus-standard-abrasives-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/longer-life-versus-standard-abrasives-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/longer-life-versus-standard-abrasives-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/longer-life-versus-standard-abrasives-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/longer-life-versus-standard-abrasives-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/longer-life-versus-standard-abrasives-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/longer-life-versus-standard-abrasives-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/longer-life-versus-standard-abrasives-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/longer-life-versus-standard-abrasives-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/longer-life-versus-standard-abrasives-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/longer-life-versus-standard-abrasives-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/longer-life-versus-standard-abrasives-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/longer-life-versus-standard-abrasives-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/longer-life-versus-standard-abrasives-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/longer-life-versus-standard-abrasives-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/longer-life-versus-standard-abrasives-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/longer-life-versus-standard-abrasives-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/longer-life-versus-standard-abrasives-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/longer-life-versus-standard-abrasives-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/longer-life-versus-standard-abrasives-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/longer-life-versus-standard-abrasives-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/longer-life-versus-standard-abrasives-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/longer-life-versus-standard-abrasives-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/longer-life-versus-standard-abrasives-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>When Ceramic Outperforms Aluminum Oxide</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 13:34:14 +0000</pubDate><category>Ceramic &amp; Premium Abrasives</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-180</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>dry sanding</category><category>clear coat</category><category>orbital sander</category><category>dust control</category><description>Learn when ceramic sanding discs beat aluminum oxide: cut rate, heat control, cost per part, and pro tips for metal, wood, and composites.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="when-ceramic-sanding-discs-outperform-aluminum-oxide"&gt;When Ceramic Sanding Discs Outperform Aluminum Oxide&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a quiet Saturday morning, the garage becomes your studio. You’ve cleared a workbench, lined up clamps and rags, and lit the space with a warm shop lamp. The project is personal: a welded steel coffee table for the living room, something sturdy and simple that can hold the weight of everyday life. The first passes with a grinder feel hopeful—until the discs start glazing. Heat builds, paint smears, and the cut slows to a crawl. You switch to a finer grit, then back again, but the aluminum oxide discs keep dulling, forcing you to lean harder. The surface looks scuffed but not flat, and your shoulders ache from forcing the tool to do what the abrasive simply won’t.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/when-ceramic-outperforms-aluminum-oxide-ceramic-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item></channel></rss>

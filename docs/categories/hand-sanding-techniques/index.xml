&lt;p&gt;I remember the first time a curve made me question my craft. It was a walnut keepsake box with a lid that looked perfect on CAD: a soft 10 mm radius running cleanly along all four edges. On the bench, though, the radius fought back. My block sander flattened the apex, my random-orbit sander skated off the edge, and every “shortcut” I tried left flats and chatter marks that showed up under finish like neon. I finally reached for the simplest tool in the shop: a hardwood dowel, a strip of abrasive, and my hands. With careful hand sanding—wrapping the paper around a dowel that matched the profile—the radius began to read as a continuous curve instead of a sequence of mistakes. The tactile feedback told me where the high spots were; the scratch pattern told me when I was pushing too hard.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/02.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding/cards/instagram/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding/cards/instagram/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding/cards/instagram/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding/cards/pinterest/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding/cards/pinterest/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding/cards/pinterest/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/05/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/wrap-sandpaper-around-dowels-for-curved-edges-hand-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Hand Sanding Versus Power Sanding Comparison</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/hand-sanding-versus-power-sanding-comparison-hand-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/hand-sanding-versus-power-sanding-comparison-hand-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2025 16:50:43 +0000</pubDate><category>Hand Sanding Techniques</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Engineer’s comparison of hand sanding and power sanding: surface finish, speed, dust, cost, and workflow tips for wood, metal, and paint.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="hand-sanding-vs-power-sanding-an-engineers-guide"&gt;Hand sanding vs power sanding: an engineer’s guide&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a point in every restoration or build where the project stops looking like a collection of parts and starts feeling like an object with a future. For me, it’s the first moment the surface turns uniformly matte under the light. That’s usually after the first disciplined pass of hand sanding. The radio is low, dust extraction hums in the background, and the world reduces to the consistent rhythm of the block. Compare that to the blunt urgency of a random-orbit sander—faster, louder, and undeniably effective. Both have their place. When you’re staring at a hardwood tabletop with coffee rings and cross-grain scratches, or a steel bracket that needs a satin finish without rounding its crisp edges, the choice between manual strokes and powered oscillations is more than preference; it’s a process decision that dictates speed, quality, and cost.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/17.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/hand-sanding-versus-power-sanding-comparison-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/hand-sanding-versus-power-sanding-comparison-hand-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/hand-sanding-versus-power-sanding-comparison-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/hand-sanding-versus-power-sanding-comparison-hand-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/hand-sanding-versus-power-sanding-comparison-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/hand-sanding-versus-power-sanding-comparison-hand-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/hand-sanding-versus-power-sanding-comparison-hand-sanding/cards/instagram/hand-sanding-versus-power-sanding-comparison-hand-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/hand-sanding-versus-power-sanding-comparison-hand-sanding/cards/instagram/hand-sanding-versus-power-sanding-comparison-hand-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/hand-sanding-versus-power-sanding-comparison-hand-sanding/cards/instagram/hand-sanding-versus-power-sanding-comparison-hand-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/hand-sanding-versus-power-sanding-comparison-hand-sanding/cards/pinterest/hand-sanding-versus-power-sanding-comparison-hand-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/hand-sanding-versus-power-sanding-comparison-hand-sanding/cards/pinterest/hand-sanding-versus-power-sanding-comparison-hand-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/hand-sanding-versus-power-sanding-comparison-hand-sanding/cards/pinterest/hand-sanding-versus-power-sanding-comparison-hand-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/hand-sanding-versus-power-sanding-comparison-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/hand-sanding-versus-power-sanding-comparison-hand-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/hand-sanding-versus-power-sanding-comparison-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/hand-sanding-versus-power-sanding-comparison-hand-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/20/hand-sanding-versus-power-sanding-comparison-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/hand-sanding-versus-power-sanding-comparison-hand-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Choose Sanding Direction To Follow The Grain</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/09/choose-sanding-direction-to-follow-the-grain-hand-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/09/choose-sanding-direction-to-follow-the-grain-hand-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 09 Nov 2025 18:57:00 +0000</pubDate><category>Hand Sanding Techniques</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-500</category><description>Learn how to choose sanding direction, optimize abrasive performance, and master hand sanding workflows for flawless, grain-aligned wood surfaces.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="hand-sanding-with-the-grain-direction-that-wins"&gt;Hand Sanding With the Grain: Direction That Wins&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first pass across the old walnut dresser felt almost sacrilegious. Early light from the shop window caught the cathedral patterns in the veneer and made the scratches I’d inherited glow silver against the warm brown. Years of hasty refinishes had left low, cross-grain swirls that refused to disappear under fresh film. I set the random-orbit sander aside, reached for a cork block, and let the board tell me where it wanted me to go. In that moment, hand sanding was not about nostalgia—it was about control. Fingers learned the flow of the fibers, eyes trained on the raking light, strokes tracking the grain like a compass needle finally finding north.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/09/choose-sanding-direction-to-follow-the-grain-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/choose-sanding-direction-to-follow-the-grain-hand-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/09/choose-sanding-direction-to-follow-the-grain-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/choose-sanding-direction-to-follow-the-grain-hand-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/09/choose-sanding-direction-to-follow-the-grain-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/choose-sanding-direction-to-follow-the-grain-hand-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/09/choose-sanding-direction-to-follow-the-grain-hand-sanding/cards/instagram/choose-sanding-direction-to-follow-the-grain-hand-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/09/choose-sanding-direction-to-follow-the-grain-hand-sanding/cards/instagram/choose-sanding-direction-to-follow-the-grain-hand-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/09/choose-sanding-direction-to-follow-the-grain-hand-sanding/cards/instagram/choose-sanding-direction-to-follow-the-grain-hand-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/09/choose-sanding-direction-to-follow-the-grain-hand-sanding/cards/pinterest/choose-sanding-direction-to-follow-the-grain-hand-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/09/choose-sanding-direction-to-follow-the-grain-hand-sanding/cards/pinterest/choose-sanding-direction-to-follow-the-grain-hand-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/09/choose-sanding-direction-to-follow-the-grain-hand-sanding/cards/pinterest/choose-sanding-direction-to-follow-the-grain-hand-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/09/choose-sanding-direction-to-follow-the-grain-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/choose-sanding-direction-to-follow-the-grain-hand-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/09/choose-sanding-direction-to-follow-the-grain-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/choose-sanding-direction-to-follow-the-grain-hand-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/09/choose-sanding-direction-to-follow-the-grain-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/choose-sanding-direction-to-follow-the-grain-hand-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>How To Sand Wood By Hand For Smooth Finish</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 04 Nov 2025 03:41:00 +0000</pubDate><category>Hand Sanding Techniques</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>sanding block</category><category>grit progression</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>Learn hand sanding techniques, grit progression, and pro tips to achieve a flawless smooth wood finish with clear steps, tools, and troubleshooting.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="hand-sanding-for-a-glass-smooth-wood-finish"&gt;Hand sanding for a glass-smooth wood finish&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a quiet Saturday morning, the house is still enough to hear the tiny rasp of paper against wood. Sunlight falls across the table you’ve promised to restore—the one that’s been gathering keys, grocery bags, and happy-hour mail for years. At first glance, it seems fine. But run your fingertips from the center to the edge and you can feel a map of dents, glue drips, and faint chatter lines left by the last sander. This is where patience matters. This is where hand sanding earns its reputation.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding/cards/instagram/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding/cards/instagram/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding/cards/instagram/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-wood-by-hand-for-smooth-finish-hand-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item></channel></rss>

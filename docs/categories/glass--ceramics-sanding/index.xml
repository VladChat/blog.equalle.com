&lt;p&gt;You know that afternoon light that hits your workshop just right—sawdust floating like golden confetti, the radio low, a mug ring etched into the bench? That’s where precision starts for me. I remember the first time I tried to smooth a chipped glass shelf salvaged from a vintage cabinet. I treated it like hardwood: dry paper, firm pressure, and a “let’s get this done” pace. Ten minutes in, the edge flashed white, my pad squealed, and the glass pinged with that terrifying, crystalline chatter. I learned fast: glass doesn’t forgive heat. It stores stress the way steel stores spring.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/03.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding/cards/instagram/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding/cards/instagram/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding/cards/instagram/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding/cards/pinterest/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding/cards/pinterest/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding/cards/pinterest/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/keep-surfaces-wet-to-control-heat-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Progressive Micron Steps For Clarity</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 08 Nov 2025 00:41:16 +0000</pubDate><category>Glass &amp; Ceramics Sanding</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-500</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>Engineer-tested guide to glass sanding using progressive micron steps for optical clarity, with media choices, wet technique, and polishing workflow.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="glass-sanding-progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity"&gt;Glass Sanding: Progressive Micron Steps for Clarity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You notice it first at breakfast—the way the morning light breaks into a haze across your coffee table. A scratch the length of a paperclip sits dead center, scattering highlights into a milky halo that wasn’t there last week. You run a fingernail across it. The catch is slight, but it’s there. It’s the same story with a watch crystal that met a brick wall one hurried afternoon, or a window panel that’s accumulated fine swirls from years of cleaning. Replacing glass is one option, but it’s expensive, wasteful, and impractical for built-ins. As a product engineer who spends an unreasonable amount of time testing abrasives, I prefer another route: controlled, progressive glass sanding that restores optical clarity rather than hides damage.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding/cards/instagram/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding/cards/instagram/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding/cards/instagram/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding/cards/pinterest/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding/cards/pinterest/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding/cards/pinterest/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/progressive-micron-steps-for-clarity-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Use Diamond Or Sic For Glass Edges</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 23:29:24 +0000</pubDate><category>Glass &amp; Ceramics Sanding</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-280</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1200</category><category>grit-2500</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>wet sanding</category><description>Technical guide to glass sanding for chip‑free edges using diamond or SiC abrasives, with grit sequences, coolant control, and polishing workflows.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="glass-sanding-for-clean-safe-edges-diamond-vs-sic"&gt;Glass sanding for clean, safe edges: diamond vs SiC&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The moment you lift a freshly cut pane, you feel it: the edge that looks fine from arm’s length but carries invisible threats—micro-chips, stress risers, and the slight granular drag under a fingertip that says the finish is not ready for handling. Anyone who has ever fit a glass shelf, framed a museum-grade print, or repurposed a bottle knows that the edge is where projects succeed or fail. That’s where glass sanding earns its keep. Thoughtful abrasive selection and disciplined technique turn a risky raw cut into a safe, optically clean edge that won’t shed fragments, haze, or propagate cracks under load. Whether you’re tuning a small arris for furniture-grade touch or chasing an optical polish on a laminated panel, the goal is the same: remove damage quickly, control heat, and leave a tight subsurface that won’t surprise you months later.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding/cards/instagram/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding/cards/instagram/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding/cards/instagram/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding/cards/pinterest/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding/cards/pinterest/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding/cards/pinterest/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding/cards/facebook/use-diamond-or-sic-for-glass-edges-glass-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>14</readingTime></item></channel></rss>

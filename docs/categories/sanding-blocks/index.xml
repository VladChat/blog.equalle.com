&lt;p&gt;There’s a moment in any refinishing project when your eye catches the light just right and you see it: subtle waves in a tabletop, a faint ripple in primer, a break in the reflections across a glossy guitar body. You feel it with your fingertips too—those barely-there rises and dips that make the difference between “good enough” and “crafted.” I remember the first time I noticed how my results changed when I switched from a soft pad to a rigid sanding block. The surface I thought was “close” suddenly told the truth. Within a few careful passes, the highs dulled evenly and the lows showed as untouched pencil marks. In minutes, the surface was flatter than I’d ever achieved before.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><readingTime>13</readingTime></item><item><title>When To Use Sanding Blocks Versus Bare Hand</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 02:57:35 +0000</pubDate><category>Sanding Blocks</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>sanding block</category><category>dry sanding</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Learn when to use a sanding block versus bare-hand sanding for flawless finishes.

&lt;p&gt;The first pass of the evening always tells you how the job will go. You clamp a pine shelf to the bench, switch on the task light, and run your fingertips across a coat of primer that’s not quite right—dust nibs, a few raised grain lines, a ridge where you filled a knot. The shop is quiet except for the small rasp of paper as you tear a new sheet. You think about reaching for your trusty sanding block, the one that’s squared a hundred edges and leveled just as many fills. Then you pause. The shelf has a soft, rounded front, and you can feel a subtle dip near the corner. A hard block might flatten more than you want. Your bare hand, wrapped around a fold of 320-grit, could trace the curve and polish it without flattening the profile. This is the moment that separates a good finish from a great one: choosing the right sanding approach for the surface in front of you.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><readingTime>13</readingTime></item></channel></rss>

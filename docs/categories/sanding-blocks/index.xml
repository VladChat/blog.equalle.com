&lt;p&gt;There’s a quiet satisfaction when a board’s edge goes from ragged to crisp under your fingertips. You sight down the length, catch a glint of shop light, and see a clean, uninterrupted line—no ripples, no dips, no proud corners snagging a cloth. That straightness is the difference between a door that closes like a whisper and one that bites the jamb. It’s the moment where craft meets physics, and for me—an engineer who lives for process—the right tool is what makes that moment repeatable. For edge work, that tool is a sanding block.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/05.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block/cards/facebook/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block/cards/facebook/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block/cards/facebook/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block/cards/instagram/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block/cards/instagram/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block/cards/instagram/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block/cards/facebook/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block/cards/facebook/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block/cards/facebook/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Wrap Sandpaper Correctly On A Block</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 14:51:04 +0000</pubDate><category>Sanding Blocks</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>sanding block</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>dry sanding</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Learn how to wrap sandpaper on a sanding block for flat, fast, scratch-free results.

&lt;p&gt;I still remember the first shelf I built for our entryway—a simple maple plank resting on two brackets, meant to hold keys and a couple of planters. The board came out of the planer with faint ripples; the chamfers were uneven; and the finish looked decent from six feet away but not when the morning light hit. I did what many DIYers do: grabbed a sheet of paper, wrapped it around a block haphazardly, and pushed until my fingers ached. The final surface was smooth-ish, but I had shallow waves and rounded corners that betrayed the lack of control. Only after I switched to a properly wrapped sanding block did the maple flatten, the scratch pattern tighten, and my edges stay crisp.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/20.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block/cards/facebook/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block/cards/facebook/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block/cards/facebook/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block/cards/instagram/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block/cards/instagram/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block/cards/instagram/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block/cards/facebook/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block/cards/facebook/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block/cards/facebook/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>13</readingTime></item><item><title>Choose Cork Or Rubber Blocks For Even Pressure</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 16:32:32 +0000</pubDate><category>Sanding Blocks</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>sanding block</category><description>Decide between cork and rubber sanding block for even pressure.

&lt;p&gt;You feel it before you see it: the drag of abrasive across primer, the subtle chatter in your wrist, the way dust plumes differently at the edge than it does in the center. The project might be a cabinet door with raised panels, an automotive quarter panel wearing its first coat of high-build, or a mid-century tabletop with a veneer you refuse to risk. Regardless of the substrate, the instrument in your hand—a sanding block—is the difference between flat and faceted, between crisp and crowned. When the pressure is wrong, the finish is wrong. The telltale symptoms appear later: telegraphed low spots under gloss, rounded edges where a sharp reveal should live, swirl hazing that refuses to die at the next grit.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/04.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/cards/facebook/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/cards/facebook/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/cards/facebook/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/cards/instagram/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/cards/instagram/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/cards/instagram/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/cards/facebook/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/cards/facebook/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/cards/facebook/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>13</readingTime></item><item><title>Keep Surfaces Flat With Rigid Blocks</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 05 Nov 2025 15:23:32 +0000</pubDate><category>Sanding Blocks</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>sanding block</category><description>Learn how rigid sanding blocks keep surfaces flat, when to use them, and the techniques, materials, and tips that deliver flawless, true results.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="keep-surfaces-flat-with-a-rigid-sanding-block"&gt;Keep Surfaces Flat with a Rigid Sanding Block&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a moment in any refinishing project when your eye catches the light just right and you see it: subtle waves in a tabletop, a faint ripple in primer, a break in the reflections across a glossy guitar body. You feel it with your fingertips too—those barely-there rises and dips that make the difference between “good enough” and “crafted.” I remember the first time I noticed how my results changed when I switched from a soft pad to a rigid sanding block. The surface I thought was “close” suddenly told the truth. Within a few careful passes, the highs dulled evenly and the lows showed as untouched pencil marks. In minutes, the surface was flatter than I’d ever achieved before.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/cards/facebook/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/cards/facebook/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/cards/facebook/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/cards/instagram/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/cards/instagram/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/cards/instagram/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/cards/facebook/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/cards/facebook/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/cards/facebook/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>13</readingTime></item><item><title>When To Use Sanding Blocks Versus Bare Hand</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 02:57:35 +0000</pubDate><category>Sanding Blocks</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>sanding block</category><category>dry sanding</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Learn when to use a sanding block versus bare-hand sanding for flawless finishes.

&lt;p&gt;The first pass of the evening always tells you how the job will go. You clamp a pine shelf to the bench, switch on the task light, and run your fingertips across a coat of primer that’s not quite right—dust nibs, a few raised grain lines, a ridge where you filled a knot. The shop is quiet except for the small rasp of paper as you tear a new sheet. You think about reaching for your trusty sanding block, the one that’s squared a hundred edges and leveled just as many fills. Then you pause. The shelf has a soft, rounded front, and you can feel a subtle dip near the corner. A hard block might flatten more than you want. Your bare hand, wrapped around a fold of 320-grit, could trace the curve and polish it without flattening the profile. This is the moment that separates a good finish from a great one: choosing the right sanding approach for the surface in front of you.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block/cards/facebook/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block/cards/facebook/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block/cards/facebook/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block/cards/instagram/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block/cards/instagram/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block/cards/instagram/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block/cards/facebook/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block/cards/facebook/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block/cards/facebook/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>13</readingTime></item></channel></rss>

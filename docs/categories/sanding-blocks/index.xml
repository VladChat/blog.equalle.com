&lt;p&gt;I remember the first time a “ghost” scratch ruined my day. The guitar body looked perfect under shop lights—planed, filled, and leveled. Then I wiped with naphtha for a clarity check and, like a contrail across a blue sky, a fine arc appeared high on the lower bout. It didn’t track with the last sanding direction, and it cut deeper than the surrounding grain. I had been meticulous about grit progression, pressure, and lighting. But I hadn’t done the one simple thing that would have prevented it: cleaning my sanding block and abrasive before that final pass.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/11.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/24/clean-blocks-to-avoid-stray-scratches-sanding-block/cards/facebook/clean-blocks-to-avoid-stray-scratches-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/24/clean-blocks-to-avoid-stray-scratches-sanding-block/cards/facebook/clean-blocks-to-avoid-stray-scratches-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/24/clean-blocks-to-avoid-stray-scratches-sanding-block/cards/facebook/clean-blocks-to-avoid-stray-scratches-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/24/clean-blocks-to-avoid-stray-scratches-sanding-block/cards/instagram/clean-blocks-to-avoid-stray-scratches-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/24/clean-blocks-to-avoid-stray-scratches-sanding-block/cards/instagram/clean-blocks-to-avoid-stray-scratches-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/24/clean-blocks-to-avoid-stray-scratches-sanding-block/cards/instagram/clean-blocks-to-avoid-stray-scratches-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/24/clean-blocks-to-avoid-stray-scratches-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/clean-blocks-to-avoid-stray-scratches-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/24/clean-blocks-to-avoid-stray-scratches-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/clean-blocks-to-avoid-stray-scratches-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/24/clean-blocks-to-avoid-stray-scratches-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/clean-blocks-to-avoid-stray-scratches-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/24/clean-blocks-to-avoid-stray-scratches-sanding-block/cards/facebook/clean-blocks-to-avoid-stray-scratches-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/24/clean-blocks-to-avoid-stray-scratches-sanding-block/cards/facebook/clean-blocks-to-avoid-stray-scratches-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/24/clean-blocks-to-avoid-stray-scratches-sanding-block/cards/facebook/clean-blocks-to-avoid-stray-scratches-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Match Block Hardness To The Surface Shape</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/07/match-block-hardness-to-the-surface-shape-sanding-block/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/07/match-block-hardness-to-the-surface-shape-sanding-block/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 07 Feb 2026 16:57:40 +0000</pubDate><category>Sanding Blocks</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>sanding block</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Learn how to match sanding block hardness to surface geometry for flat panels, contours, and edges.

&lt;p&gt;The memory is small but vivid: a late evening in the garage, raking light across a cherry drawer front that looked perfect from a distance. Under the lamp, the truth appeared—uneven sheen, slight hollows near the pull recess, and a treacherously rounded lower edge. Hours of sanding, and I had softened the geometry I meant to preserve. The culprit wasn’t the grit or the wood species; it was the mismatch between the workpiece shape and the hardness of the sanding block in my hand. I was using a foam block on flats that demanded something rigid, and a rigid block on contours that needed controlled compliance. That night I learned that selecting the correct backing hardness is as fundamental as choosing the right abrasive.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/24.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/07/match-block-hardness-to-the-surface-shape-sanding-block/cards/facebook/match-block-hardness-to-the-surface-shape-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/07/match-block-hardness-to-the-surface-shape-sanding-block/cards/facebook/match-block-hardness-to-the-surface-shape-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/07/match-block-hardness-to-the-surface-shape-sanding-block/cards/facebook/match-block-hardness-to-the-surface-shape-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/07/match-block-hardness-to-the-surface-shape-sanding-block/cards/instagram/match-block-hardness-to-the-surface-shape-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/07/match-block-hardness-to-the-surface-shape-sanding-block/cards/instagram/match-block-hardness-to-the-surface-shape-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/07/match-block-hardness-to-the-surface-shape-sanding-block/cards/instagram/match-block-hardness-to-the-surface-shape-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/07/match-block-hardness-to-the-surface-shape-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/match-block-hardness-to-the-surface-shape-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/07/match-block-hardness-to-the-surface-shape-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/match-block-hardness-to-the-surface-shape-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/07/match-block-hardness-to-the-surface-shape-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/match-block-hardness-to-the-surface-shape-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/07/match-block-hardness-to-the-surface-shape-sanding-block/cards/facebook/match-block-hardness-to-the-surface-shape-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/07/match-block-hardness-to-the-surface-shape-sanding-block/cards/facebook/match-block-hardness-to-the-surface-shape-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/07/match-block-hardness-to-the-surface-shape-sanding-block/cards/facebook/match-block-hardness-to-the-surface-shape-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Block Sanding Tips For Woodworking</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/19/block-sanding-tips-for-woodworking-sanding-block/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/19/block-sanding-tips-for-woodworking-sanding-block/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 14:49:53 +0000</pubDate><category>Sanding Blocks</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-220</category><category>sanding block</category><category>dust control</category><category>grit progression</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>Master block sanding with the right sanding block, grit, and technique.

&lt;p&gt;Saturday sunlight cuts through the garage dust as you run a hand along the tabletop you’ve been building for weeks. It’s close—close enough that friends would call it done—but your fingertips still catch where the light catches: faint ripples, a couple of low spots, swirl ghosts you can’t quite ignore. You try another pass with a random-orbit sander and the same thing happens—some areas look better, others worse. It feels like a conversation where you keep talking past the point, never quite saying what you mean. Then you reach for a simple tool that promises a steadier answer: a sanding block.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/08.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/19/block-sanding-tips-for-woodworking-sanding-block/cards/facebook/block-sanding-tips-for-woodworking-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/19/block-sanding-tips-for-woodworking-sanding-block/cards/facebook/block-sanding-tips-for-woodworking-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/19/block-sanding-tips-for-woodworking-sanding-block/cards/facebook/block-sanding-tips-for-woodworking-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/19/block-sanding-tips-for-woodworking-sanding-block/cards/instagram/block-sanding-tips-for-woodworking-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/19/block-sanding-tips-for-woodworking-sanding-block/cards/instagram/block-sanding-tips-for-woodworking-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/19/block-sanding-tips-for-woodworking-sanding-block/cards/instagram/block-sanding-tips-for-woodworking-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/19/block-sanding-tips-for-woodworking-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/block-sanding-tips-for-woodworking-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/19/block-sanding-tips-for-woodworking-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/block-sanding-tips-for-woodworking-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/19/block-sanding-tips-for-woodworking-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/block-sanding-tips-for-woodworking-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/19/block-sanding-tips-for-woodworking-sanding-block/cards/facebook/block-sanding-tips-for-woodworking-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/19/block-sanding-tips-for-woodworking-sanding-block/cards/facebook/block-sanding-tips-for-woodworking-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/19/block-sanding-tips-for-woodworking-sanding-block/cards/facebook/block-sanding-tips-for-woodworking-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Cross Sanding Method For Leveling Panels</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 15:55:05 +0000</pubDate><category>Sanding Blocks</category><category>grit-240</category><category>sanding block</category><category>clear coat</category><category>orbital sander</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Learn the cross sanding method for leveling panels.

&lt;p&gt;The first time you chase “flat” across a panel, it sneaks up on you. Early morning, bench light low and raking, coffee cooling by the vise. You sight across a tabletop you’ve glued up—a handsome mix of maple and walnut—certain you nailed the clamps this time. But you feel it before you see it: the slightest rise where two boards meet, a shallow dish near one corner that catches the light like a ripple on a still pond. It’s not bad, but it’s enough to make a finish telegraph every imperfection. You could reach for a random orbital and it would eventually get you there, but it’s like mowing a lawn in circles. There’s a faster, more controlled way to true a surface: cross sanding with a sanding block.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/21.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block/cards/facebook/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block/cards/facebook/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block/cards/facebook/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block/cards/instagram/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block/cards/instagram/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block/cards/instagram/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block/cards/facebook/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block/cards/facebook/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/30/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block/cards/facebook/cross-sanding-method-for-leveling-panels-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Sand Edges Straight With Block Control</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 11 Dec 2025 13:45:02 +0000</pubDate><category>Sanding Blocks</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-280</category><category>sanding block</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Engineer-tested methods to sand edges straight with block control—covering block materials, grits, pressure, and measurement for crisp, furniture-grade results.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="straight-edges-with-a-sanding-block-engineers-guide"&gt;Straight Edges with a Sanding Block: Engineer’s Guide&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a quiet satisfaction when a board’s edge goes from ragged to crisp under your fingertips. You sight down the length, catch a glint of shop light, and see a clean, uninterrupted line—no ripples, no dips, no proud corners snagging a cloth. That straightness is the difference between a door that closes like a whisper and one that bites the jamb. It’s the moment where craft meets physics, and for me—an engineer who lives for process—the right tool is what makes that moment repeatable. For edge work, that tool is a sanding block.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/05.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block/cards/facebook/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block/cards/facebook/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block/cards/facebook/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block/cards/instagram/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block/cards/instagram/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block/cards/instagram/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block/cards/facebook/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block/cards/facebook/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block/cards/facebook/sand-edges-straight-with-block-control-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Wrap Sandpaper Correctly On A Block</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 14:51:04 +0000</pubDate><category>Sanding Blocks</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>sanding block</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>dry sanding</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Learn how to wrap sandpaper on a sanding block for flat, fast, scratch-free results.

&lt;p&gt;I still remember the first shelf I built for our entryway—a simple maple plank resting on two brackets, meant to hold keys and a couple of planters. The board came out of the planer with faint ripples; the chamfers were uneven; and the finish looked decent from six feet away but not when the morning light hit. I did what many DIYers do: grabbed a sheet of paper, wrapped it around a block haphazardly, and pushed until my fingers ached. The final surface was smooth-ish, but I had shallow waves and rounded corners that betrayed the lack of control. Only after I switched to a properly wrapped sanding block did the maple flatten, the scratch pattern tighten, and my edges stay crisp.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/20.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block/cards/facebook/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block/cards/facebook/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block/cards/facebook/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block/cards/instagram/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block/cards/instagram/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block/cards/instagram/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block/cards/facebook/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block/cards/facebook/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block/cards/facebook/wrap-sandpaper-correctly-on-a-block-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>13</readingTime></item><item><title>Choose Cork Or Rubber Blocks For Even Pressure</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 16:32:32 +0000</pubDate><category>Sanding Blocks</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>sanding block</category><description>Decide between cork and rubber sanding block for even pressure.

&lt;p&gt;You feel it before you see it: the drag of abrasive across primer, the subtle chatter in your wrist, the way dust plumes differently at the edge than it does in the center. The project might be a cabinet door with raised panels, an automotive quarter panel wearing its first coat of high-build, or a mid-century tabletop with a veneer you refuse to risk. Regardless of the substrate, the instrument in your hand—a sanding block—is the difference between flat and faceted, between crisp and crowned. When the pressure is wrong, the finish is wrong. The telltale symptoms appear later: telegraphed low spots under gloss, rounded edges where a sharp reveal should live, swirl hazing that refuses to die at the next grit.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/04.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/cards/facebook/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/cards/facebook/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/cards/facebook/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/cards/instagram/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/cards/instagram/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/cards/instagram/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/cards/facebook/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/cards/facebook/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/13/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block/cards/facebook/choose-cork-or-rubber-blocks-for-even-pressure-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>13</readingTime></item><item><title>Keep Surfaces Flat With Rigid Blocks</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 05 Nov 2025 15:23:32 +0000</pubDate><category>Sanding Blocks</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>sanding block</category><description>Learn how rigid sanding blocks keep surfaces flat, when to use them, and the techniques, materials, and tips that deliver flawless, true results.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="keep-surfaces-flat-with-a-rigid-sanding-block"&gt;Keep Surfaces Flat with a Rigid Sanding Block&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a moment in any refinishing project when your eye catches the light just right and you see it: subtle waves in a tabletop, a faint ripple in primer, a break in the reflections across a glossy guitar body. You feel it with your fingertips too—those barely-there rises and dips that make the difference between “good enough” and “crafted.” I remember the first time I noticed how my results changed when I switched from a soft pad to a rigid sanding block. The surface I thought was “close” suddenly told the truth. Within a few careful passes, the highs dulled evenly and the lows showed as untouched pencil marks. In minutes, the surface was flatter than I’d ever achieved before.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/cards/facebook/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/cards/facebook/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/cards/facebook/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/cards/instagram/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/cards/instagram/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/cards/instagram/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/cards/facebook/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/cards/facebook/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block/cards/facebook/keep-surfaces-flat-with-rigid-blocks-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>13</readingTime></item><item><title>When To Use Sanding Blocks Versus Bare Hand</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 02:57:35 +0000</pubDate><category>Sanding Blocks</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>sanding block</category><category>dry sanding</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Learn when to use a sanding block versus bare-hand sanding for flawless finishes.

&lt;p&gt;The first pass of the evening always tells you how the job will go. You clamp a pine shelf to the bench, switch on the task light, and run your fingertips across a coat of primer that’s not quite right—dust nibs, a few raised grain lines, a ridge where you filled a knot. The shop is quiet except for the small rasp of paper as you tear a new sheet. You think about reaching for your trusty sanding block, the one that’s squared a hundred edges and leveled just as many fills. Then you pause. The shelf has a soft, rounded front, and you can feel a subtle dip near the corner. A hard block might flatten more than you want. Your bare hand, wrapped around a fold of 320-grit, could trace the curve and polish it without flattening the profile. This is the moment that separates a good finish from a great one: choosing the right sanding approach for the surface in front of you.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block/cards/facebook/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block/cards/facebook/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block/cards/facebook/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block/cards/instagram/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block/cards/instagram/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block/cards/instagram/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block/cards/pinterest/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block/cards/facebook/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block/cards/facebook/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block/cards/facebook/when-to-use-sanding-blocks-versus-bare-hand-sanding-block.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>13</readingTime></item></channel></rss>

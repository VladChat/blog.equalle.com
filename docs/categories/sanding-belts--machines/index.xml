&lt;p&gt;There’s a moment most makers know: you flick on the shop light before dawn, coffee warming your hands, and the room hums awake. The bench is still a little chaotic from the last session—pencils buried under shavings, the faint maple scent lingering, and a project that almost looks finished. Almost. You run your fingers over a tabletop and feel what the eye can’t see: a slight wave, a glue line sitting a hair proud, a corner that needs softening. The belt sander is there, steadfast, promising speed and control. It can erase hours of awkward hand sanding—but only if you guide it with care.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/24.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/26/belt-sander-safety-and-technique-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/belt-sander-safety-and-technique-sanding-belts.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/26/belt-sander-safety-and-technique-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/belt-sander-safety-and-technique-sanding-belts.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/26/belt-sander-safety-and-technique-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/belt-sander-safety-and-technique-sanding-belts.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/26/belt-sander-safety-and-technique-sanding-belts/cards/instagram/belt-sander-safety-and-technique-sanding-belts.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/26/belt-sander-safety-and-technique-sanding-belts/cards/instagram/belt-sander-safety-and-technique-sanding-belts.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/26/belt-sander-safety-and-technique-sanding-belts/cards/instagram/belt-sander-safety-and-technique-sanding-belts.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/26/belt-sander-safety-and-technique-sanding-belts/cards/pinterest/belt-sander-safety-and-technique-sanding-belts.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/26/belt-sander-safety-and-technique-sanding-belts/cards/pinterest/belt-sander-safety-and-technique-sanding-belts.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/26/belt-sander-safety-and-technique-sanding-belts/cards/pinterest/belt-sander-safety-and-technique-sanding-belts.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/26/belt-sander-safety-and-technique-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/belt-sander-safety-and-technique-sanding-belts.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/26/belt-sander-safety-and-technique-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/belt-sander-safety-and-technique-sanding-belts.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/26/belt-sander-safety-and-technique-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/belt-sander-safety-and-technique-sanding-belts.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Avoid Burn Marks With Belt Sanders</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 14 Nov 2025 13:35:38 +0000</pubDate><category>Sanding Belts &amp; Machines</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-240</category><description>Stop burn marks with belt sanders.

&lt;p&gt;You smell it before you see it—the faint sweet, acrid note that means heat has been winning. The shop is quiet except for the belt sander’s steady hum, dust hanging in the light like early fog. You’re two boards into a Saturday batch of maple shelves, and there it is: a brown kiss on the edge, curved perfectly to match your contact drum. It’s the same mark that has sent too many good pieces to the scrap bin. You lighten your touch, bump the feed, try another pass. The scorch grows one shade darker. If you’ve stood at a belt sander—handheld, benchtop, or wide-belt—you’ve had this moment. It’s not a lack of care. It’s heat, friction, and time teaming up faster than you can move.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/08.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts/cards/instagram/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts/cards/instagram/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts/cards/instagram/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts/cards/pinterest/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts/cards/pinterest/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts/cards/pinterest/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Track And Tension Sanding Belts Properly</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/track-and-tension-sanding-belts-properly-sanding-belts/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/track-and-tension-sanding-belts-properly-sanding-belts/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 05 Nov 2025 18:06:04 +0000</pubDate><category>Sanding Belts &amp; Machines</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-150</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>Engineer-tested methods to track and tension sanding belts for stable cuts, longer life, and better finishes—plus diagnostics, calibration, and material</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="how-to-track-and-tension-sanding-belts-right"&gt;How to Track and Tension Sanding Belts Right&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still remember the first time a belt sander reminded me who’s boss. I was flattening a salvaged maple countertop in a cold garage, heater humming, coffee cooling. The sander sounded healthy at idle, but as soon as I leaned into it, the belt crept right, kissed the guard, and started singing. Within thirty seconds, grains glazed over on one edge, dust plumed unevenly, and the finish was streaky. I backed off, re-centered, nudged the tracking knob a hair, and tried again. Same result—only now the seam thumped every revolution. The culprit wasn’t just a “bad belt.” It was a bad setup: improper tension and unstable tracking.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/track-and-tension-sanding-belts-properly-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/track-and-tension-sanding-belts-properly-sanding-belts.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/track-and-tension-sanding-belts-properly-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/track-and-tension-sanding-belts-properly-sanding-belts.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/track-and-tension-sanding-belts-properly-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/track-and-tension-sanding-belts-properly-sanding-belts.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/track-and-tension-sanding-belts-properly-sanding-belts/cards/instagram/track-and-tension-sanding-belts-properly-sanding-belts.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/track-and-tension-sanding-belts-properly-sanding-belts/cards/instagram/track-and-tension-sanding-belts-properly-sanding-belts.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/track-and-tension-sanding-belts-properly-sanding-belts/cards/instagram/track-and-tension-sanding-belts-properly-sanding-belts.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/track-and-tension-sanding-belts-properly-sanding-belts/cards/pinterest/track-and-tension-sanding-belts-properly-sanding-belts.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/track-and-tension-sanding-belts-properly-sanding-belts/cards/pinterest/track-and-tension-sanding-belts-properly-sanding-belts.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/track-and-tension-sanding-belts-properly-sanding-belts/cards/pinterest/track-and-tension-sanding-belts-properly-sanding-belts.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/track-and-tension-sanding-belts-properly-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/track-and-tension-sanding-belts-properly-sanding-belts.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/track-and-tension-sanding-belts-properly-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/track-and-tension-sanding-belts-properly-sanding-belts.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/track-and-tension-sanding-belts-properly-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/track-and-tension-sanding-belts-properly-sanding-belts.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Grit Sequence For Wood Belt Sanding</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/grit-sequence-for-wood-belt-sanding-sanding-belts/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/grit-sequence-for-wood-belt-sanding-sanding-belts/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 04:05:03 +0000</pubDate><category>Sanding Belts &amp; Machines</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Master the optimal grit sequence for wood belt sanding.

&lt;p&gt;You notice it the moment the light angles in—those faint stripes that refuse to disappear, telegraphing through the first coat of finish like ghosted fingerprints. They’re the memory of rushed prep, of skipped grits and overheated passes. Anyone who has carried a tabletop into the sun and watched it betray a thousand micro-scratches knows the sting. Precision starts long before the finish can, and the most reliable way to get there is a disciplined grit sequence paired with the right sanding belts. Whether you run a 37-inch wide-belt sander in a small shop or rely on a handheld belt sander to flatten stubborn stock, the same physics apply: remove the deepest scratches with efficiency, generate finer, uniform scratches, and stop at the highest grit that supports your finish system without burnishing the surface.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/grit-sequence-for-wood-belt-sanding-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/grit-sequence-for-wood-belt-sanding-sanding-belts.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/grit-sequence-for-wood-belt-sanding-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/grit-sequence-for-wood-belt-sanding-sanding-belts.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/grit-sequence-for-wood-belt-sanding-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/grit-sequence-for-wood-belt-sanding-sanding-belts.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/grit-sequence-for-wood-belt-sanding-sanding-belts/cards/instagram/grit-sequence-for-wood-belt-sanding-sanding-belts.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/grit-sequence-for-wood-belt-sanding-sanding-belts/cards/instagram/grit-sequence-for-wood-belt-sanding-sanding-belts.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/grit-sequence-for-wood-belt-sanding-sanding-belts/cards/instagram/grit-sequence-for-wood-belt-sanding-sanding-belts.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/grit-sequence-for-wood-belt-sanding-sanding-belts/cards/pinterest/grit-sequence-for-wood-belt-sanding-sanding-belts.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/grit-sequence-for-wood-belt-sanding-sanding-belts/cards/pinterest/grit-sequence-for-wood-belt-sanding-sanding-belts.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/grit-sequence-for-wood-belt-sanding-sanding-belts/cards/pinterest/grit-sequence-for-wood-belt-sanding-sanding-belts.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/grit-sequence-for-wood-belt-sanding-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/grit-sequence-for-wood-belt-sanding-sanding-belts.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/grit-sequence-for-wood-belt-sanding-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/grit-sequence-for-wood-belt-sanding-sanding-belts.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/grit-sequence-for-wood-belt-sanding-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/grit-sequence-for-wood-belt-sanding-sanding-belts.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>13</readingTime></item></channel></rss>

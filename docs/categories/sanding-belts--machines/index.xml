&lt;p&gt;A winter evening, the kitchen lights are low, and the cutting board you glued up yesterday is resting on the counter, checkerboard end grain catching the warm glow. You run a hand over the surface and feel proud—until your fingertips find those stubborn ridges where boards meet, the faint scallops from clamping pressure, and a little glue squeeze-out that dried just shy of invisible. You know an orbital sander will be slow going, and a planer is off-limits for end grain. So you reach for the belt sander, a few fresh sanding belts in the drawer, and the promise that—done right—you can level and refine this surface without a drum sander, without chatter, and without rounding the edges you worked so hard to square.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/15.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/25/edge-and-end-grain-with-belt-sander-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/edge-and-end-grain-with-belt-sander-sanding-belts.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/25/edge-and-end-grain-with-belt-sander-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/edge-and-end-grain-with-belt-sander-sanding-belts.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/25/edge-and-end-grain-with-belt-sander-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/edge-and-end-grain-with-belt-sander-sanding-belts.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/25/edge-and-end-grain-with-belt-sander-sanding-belts/cards/instagram/edge-and-end-grain-with-belt-sander-sanding-belts.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/25/edge-and-end-grain-with-belt-sander-sanding-belts/cards/instagram/edge-and-end-grain-with-belt-sander-sanding-belts.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/25/edge-and-end-grain-with-belt-sander-sanding-belts/cards/instagram/edge-and-end-grain-with-belt-sander-sanding-belts.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/25/edge-and-end-grain-with-belt-sander-sanding-belts/cards/pinterest/edge-and-end-grain-with-belt-sander-sanding-belts.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/25/edge-and-end-grain-with-belt-sander-sanding-belts/cards/pinterest/edge-and-end-grain-with-belt-sander-sanding-belts.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/25/edge-and-end-grain-with-belt-sander-sanding-belts/cards/pinterest/edge-and-end-grain-with-belt-sander-sanding-belts.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/25/edge-and-end-grain-with-belt-sander-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/edge-and-end-grain-with-belt-sander-sanding-belts.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/25/edge-and-end-grain-with-belt-sander-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/edge-and-end-grain-with-belt-sander-sanding-belts.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/25/edge-and-end-grain-with-belt-sander-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/edge-and-end-grain-with-belt-sander-sanding-belts.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Align Belt Joints And Maintain Flatness</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/08/align-belt-joints-and-maintain-flatness-sanding-belts/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/08/align-belt-joints-and-maintain-flatness-sanding-belts/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 08 Feb 2026 15:31:23 +0000</pubDate><category>Sanding Belts &amp; Machines</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-240</category><description>Align belt joints and keep surfaces truly flat with sanding belts—setup, techniques, and troubleshooting from a pro who sands for a living.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="sanding-belts-for-aligned-joints-and-flat-results"&gt;Sanding Belts for Aligned Joints and Flat Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a certain silence that rolls in after you switch off the dust collector—just the soft ping of cooling metal and the faint smell of oak or steel. I love that moment, because it tells me the surface is either ready for finish… or it’s not. Years ago, I flattened a walnut tabletop after dinner, convinced I’d nailed it. Under bright morning light, I saw it: a slight washboard pattern running across the grain, a rhythm I could feel with my palm and see in raking light. The culprit wasn’t my hands; it was the belt seam—barely proud, slightly misaligned—telegraphing with every pass. That was the day I got serious about how sanding belts, joints, and machine setup dictate flatness just as much as technique.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/28.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/08/align-belt-joints-and-maintain-flatness-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/align-belt-joints-and-maintain-flatness-sanding-belts.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/08/align-belt-joints-and-maintain-flatness-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/align-belt-joints-and-maintain-flatness-sanding-belts.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/08/align-belt-joints-and-maintain-flatness-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/align-belt-joints-and-maintain-flatness-sanding-belts.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/08/align-belt-joints-and-maintain-flatness-sanding-belts/cards/instagram/align-belt-joints-and-maintain-flatness-sanding-belts.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/08/align-belt-joints-and-maintain-flatness-sanding-belts/cards/instagram/align-belt-joints-and-maintain-flatness-sanding-belts.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/08/align-belt-joints-and-maintain-flatness-sanding-belts/cards/instagram/align-belt-joints-and-maintain-flatness-sanding-belts.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/08/align-belt-joints-and-maintain-flatness-sanding-belts/cards/pinterest/align-belt-joints-and-maintain-flatness-sanding-belts.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/08/align-belt-joints-and-maintain-flatness-sanding-belts/cards/pinterest/align-belt-joints-and-maintain-flatness-sanding-belts.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/08/align-belt-joints-and-maintain-flatness-sanding-belts/cards/pinterest/align-belt-joints-and-maintain-flatness-sanding-belts.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/08/align-belt-joints-and-maintain-flatness-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/align-belt-joints-and-maintain-flatness-sanding-belts.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/08/align-belt-joints-and-maintain-flatness-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/align-belt-joints-and-maintain-flatness-sanding-belts.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/08/align-belt-joints-and-maintain-flatness-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/align-belt-joints-and-maintain-flatness-sanding-belts.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>13</readingTime></item><item><title>Prevent Clogging On Resinous Woods</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/21/prevent-clogging-on-resinous-woods-sanding-belts/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/21/prevent-clogging-on-resinous-woods-sanding-belts/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 13:53:23 +0000</pubDate><category>Sanding Belts &amp; Machines</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-360</category><description>Engineer-tested ways to prevent sanding belt loading on pine and fir.

&lt;p&gt;The first time I tried to tame a stack of knotty Southern yellow pine, I thought new sanding belts would be my shortcut to a glassy finish. The shop smelled like turpentine and warm sugar—pitch warming in the fibers—and the belt sander sounded confident until the tone changed. Within minutes, cut rate fell off a cliff. The abrasive looked frosted in amber: a mosaic of resin streaks and smeared dust welded into the grit. I slowed my feed, pressed harder, and just made more heat. The belt polished rather than cut; the workpiece glazed. I swapped belts, only to watch the next one load just as fast.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/12.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/21/prevent-clogging-on-resinous-woods-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/prevent-clogging-on-resinous-woods-sanding-belts.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/21/prevent-clogging-on-resinous-woods-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/prevent-clogging-on-resinous-woods-sanding-belts.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/21/prevent-clogging-on-resinous-woods-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/prevent-clogging-on-resinous-woods-sanding-belts.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/21/prevent-clogging-on-resinous-woods-sanding-belts/cards/instagram/prevent-clogging-on-resinous-woods-sanding-belts.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/21/prevent-clogging-on-resinous-woods-sanding-belts/cards/instagram/prevent-clogging-on-resinous-woods-sanding-belts.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/21/prevent-clogging-on-resinous-woods-sanding-belts/cards/instagram/prevent-clogging-on-resinous-woods-sanding-belts.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/21/prevent-clogging-on-resinous-woods-sanding-belts/cards/pinterest/prevent-clogging-on-resinous-woods-sanding-belts.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/21/prevent-clogging-on-resinous-woods-sanding-belts/cards/pinterest/prevent-clogging-on-resinous-woods-sanding-belts.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/21/prevent-clogging-on-resinous-woods-sanding-belts/cards/pinterest/prevent-clogging-on-resinous-woods-sanding-belts.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/21/prevent-clogging-on-resinous-woods-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/prevent-clogging-on-resinous-woods-sanding-belts.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/21/prevent-clogging-on-resinous-woods-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/prevent-clogging-on-resinous-woods-sanding-belts.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/21/prevent-clogging-on-resinous-woods-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/prevent-clogging-on-resinous-woods-sanding-belts.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>13</readingTime></item><item><title>Dust Extraction Setup For Belt Sanding</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/31/dust-extraction-setup-for-belt-sanding-sanding-belts/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/31/dust-extraction-setup-for-belt-sanding-sanding-belts/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 15:08:04 +0000</pubDate><category>Sanding Belts &amp; Machines</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-240</category><category>dust control</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Engineer a clean, safe, and efficient dust extraction setup for belt sanding with practical airflow targets, filtration choices, and abrasive performance tips.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="dust-extraction-setup-for-sanding-belts"&gt;Dust Extraction Setup for Sanding Belts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first time you switch on a belt sander in a quiet shop, the machine’s hum is almost soothing—until the air turns hazy and you feel grit settling on your forearms, your workbench, and the freshly glued panels waiting for finish. Dust isn’t just a nuisance; it’s process noise that blocks your ability to see scratch patterns, compromises adhesive bonds, and creates finish defects that telegraph through the final sheen. If you rely on sanding belts to prep edges, flatten stock, or break sharp corners, a sloppy extraction setup costs you time and quality. The target is not “less dust.” It’s controlled capture at the source, predictable airflow, and filtration that returns clean air to your breathing zone without starving your sander’s performance.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/25.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/31/dust-extraction-setup-for-belt-sanding-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/dust-extraction-setup-for-belt-sanding-sanding-belts.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/31/dust-extraction-setup-for-belt-sanding-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/dust-extraction-setup-for-belt-sanding-sanding-belts.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/31/dust-extraction-setup-for-belt-sanding-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/dust-extraction-setup-for-belt-sanding-sanding-belts.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/31/dust-extraction-setup-for-belt-sanding-sanding-belts/cards/instagram/dust-extraction-setup-for-belt-sanding-sanding-belts.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/31/dust-extraction-setup-for-belt-sanding-sanding-belts/cards/instagram/dust-extraction-setup-for-belt-sanding-sanding-belts.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/31/dust-extraction-setup-for-belt-sanding-sanding-belts/cards/instagram/dust-extraction-setup-for-belt-sanding-sanding-belts.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/31/dust-extraction-setup-for-belt-sanding-sanding-belts/cards/pinterest/dust-extraction-setup-for-belt-sanding-sanding-belts.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/31/dust-extraction-setup-for-belt-sanding-sanding-belts/cards/pinterest/dust-extraction-setup-for-belt-sanding-sanding-belts.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/31/dust-extraction-setup-for-belt-sanding-sanding-belts/cards/pinterest/dust-extraction-setup-for-belt-sanding-sanding-belts.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/31/dust-extraction-setup-for-belt-sanding-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/dust-extraction-setup-for-belt-sanding-sanding-belts.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/31/dust-extraction-setup-for-belt-sanding-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/dust-extraction-setup-for-belt-sanding-sanding-belts.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/31/dust-extraction-setup-for-belt-sanding-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/dust-extraction-setup-for-belt-sanding-sanding-belts.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Select Correct Belt Width For Task</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/select-correct-belt-width-for-task-sanding-belts/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/select-correct-belt-width-for-task-sanding-belts/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 11 Dec 2025 15:16:44 +0000</pubDate><category>Sanding Belts &amp; Machines</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-280</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Learn how to choose the correct sanding belt width for any task, with clear sizing steps, grit pairing advice, setup tips, and safety pointers.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="choosing-the-right-width-for-sanding-belts"&gt;Choosing the Right Width for Sanding Belts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a quiet Saturday morning, you dust off the benchtop sander you’ve had for years. The shop light warms your worktable as you reach for a fresh belt, determined to smooth a wobbly chair you promised to restore. Coffee steams nearby, the radio hums, and for a few minutes it feels like everything slows down. Then, a familiar frustration: chatter marks across the rail. You steady your hands, check alignment, slow your feed—and still the surface doesn’t level cleanly. It’s not your skill. It’s not the grit. It’s the width. This is where many makers and mechanics unknowingly lose time and precision: selecting the wrong width of sanding belts for the job.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/09.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/select-correct-belt-width-for-task-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/select-correct-belt-width-for-task-sanding-belts.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/select-correct-belt-width-for-task-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/select-correct-belt-width-for-task-sanding-belts.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/select-correct-belt-width-for-task-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/select-correct-belt-width-for-task-sanding-belts.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/select-correct-belt-width-for-task-sanding-belts/cards/instagram/select-correct-belt-width-for-task-sanding-belts.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/select-correct-belt-width-for-task-sanding-belts/cards/instagram/select-correct-belt-width-for-task-sanding-belts.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/select-correct-belt-width-for-task-sanding-belts/cards/instagram/select-correct-belt-width-for-task-sanding-belts.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/select-correct-belt-width-for-task-sanding-belts/cards/pinterest/select-correct-belt-width-for-task-sanding-belts.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/select-correct-belt-width-for-task-sanding-belts/cards/pinterest/select-correct-belt-width-for-task-sanding-belts.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/select-correct-belt-width-for-task-sanding-belts/cards/pinterest/select-correct-belt-width-for-task-sanding-belts.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/select-correct-belt-width-for-task-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/select-correct-belt-width-for-task-sanding-belts.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/select-correct-belt-width-for-task-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/select-correct-belt-width-for-task-sanding-belts.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/select-correct-belt-width-for-task-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/select-correct-belt-width-for-task-sanding-belts.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Belt Sander Safety And Technique</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/26/belt-sander-safety-and-technique-sanding-belts/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/26/belt-sander-safety-and-technique-sanding-belts/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 26 Nov 2025 13:39:50 +0000</pubDate><category>Sanding Belts &amp; Machines</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-360</category><description>A practical guide to sanding belts, belt sander safety, smart setup, and precise techniques for clean, consistent results at the workbench.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="sanding-belts-and-belt-sander-safety-essentials"&gt;Sanding Belts and Belt Sander Safety Essentials&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a moment most makers know: you flick on the shop light before dawn, coffee warming your hands, and the room hums awake. The bench is still a little chaotic from the last session—pencils buried under shavings, the faint maple scent lingering, and a project that almost looks finished. Almost. You run your fingers over a tabletop and feel what the eye can’t see: a slight wave, a glue line sitting a hair proud, a corner that needs softening. The belt sander is there, steadfast, promising speed and control. It can erase hours of awkward hand sanding—but only if you guide it with care.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/24.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/26/belt-sander-safety-and-technique-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/belt-sander-safety-and-technique-sanding-belts.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/26/belt-sander-safety-and-technique-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/belt-sander-safety-and-technique-sanding-belts.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/26/belt-sander-safety-and-technique-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/belt-sander-safety-and-technique-sanding-belts.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/26/belt-sander-safety-and-technique-sanding-belts/cards/instagram/belt-sander-safety-and-technique-sanding-belts.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/26/belt-sander-safety-and-technique-sanding-belts/cards/instagram/belt-sander-safety-and-technique-sanding-belts.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/26/belt-sander-safety-and-technique-sanding-belts/cards/instagram/belt-sander-safety-and-technique-sanding-belts.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/26/belt-sander-safety-and-technique-sanding-belts/cards/pinterest/belt-sander-safety-and-technique-sanding-belts.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/26/belt-sander-safety-and-technique-sanding-belts/cards/pinterest/belt-sander-safety-and-technique-sanding-belts.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/26/belt-sander-safety-and-technique-sanding-belts/cards/pinterest/belt-sander-safety-and-technique-sanding-belts.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/26/belt-sander-safety-and-technique-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/belt-sander-safety-and-technique-sanding-belts.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/26/belt-sander-safety-and-technique-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/belt-sander-safety-and-technique-sanding-belts.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/26/belt-sander-safety-and-technique-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/belt-sander-safety-and-technique-sanding-belts.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Avoid Burn Marks With Belt Sanders</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 14 Nov 2025 13:35:38 +0000</pubDate><category>Sanding Belts &amp; Machines</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-240</category><description>Stop burn marks with belt sanders.

&lt;p&gt;You smell it before you see it—the faint sweet, acrid note that means heat has been winning. The shop is quiet except for the belt sander’s steady hum, dust hanging in the light like early fog. You’re two boards into a Saturday batch of maple shelves, and there it is: a brown kiss on the edge, curved perfectly to match your contact drum. It’s the same mark that has sent too many good pieces to the scrap bin. You lighten your touch, bump the feed, try another pass. The scorch grows one shade darker. If you’ve stood at a belt sander—handheld, benchtop, or wide-belt—you’ve had this moment. It’s not a lack of care. It’s heat, friction, and time teaming up faster than you can move.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/08.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts/cards/instagram/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts/cards/instagram/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts/cards/instagram/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts/cards/pinterest/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts/cards/pinterest/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts/cards/pinterest/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/avoid-burn-marks-with-belt-sanders-sanding-belts.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Track And Tension Sanding Belts Properly</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/track-and-tension-sanding-belts-properly-sanding-belts/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/track-and-tension-sanding-belts-properly-sanding-belts/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 05 Nov 2025 18:06:04 +0000</pubDate><category>Sanding Belts &amp; Machines</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-150</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>Engineer-tested methods to track and tension sanding belts for stable cuts, longer life, and better finishes—plus diagnostics, calibration, and material</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="how-to-track-and-tension-sanding-belts-right"&gt;How to Track and Tension Sanding Belts Right&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still remember the first time a belt sander reminded me who’s boss. I was flattening a salvaged maple countertop in a cold garage, heater humming, coffee cooling. The sander sounded healthy at idle, but as soon as I leaned into it, the belt crept right, kissed the guard, and started singing. Within thirty seconds, grains glazed over on one edge, dust plumed unevenly, and the finish was streaky. I backed off, re-centered, nudged the tracking knob a hair, and tried again. Same result—only now the seam thumped every revolution. The culprit wasn’t just a “bad belt.” It was a bad setup: improper tension and unstable tracking.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/track-and-tension-sanding-belts-properly-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/track-and-tension-sanding-belts-properly-sanding-belts.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/track-and-tension-sanding-belts-properly-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/track-and-tension-sanding-belts-properly-sanding-belts.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/track-and-tension-sanding-belts-properly-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/track-and-tension-sanding-belts-properly-sanding-belts.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/track-and-tension-sanding-belts-properly-sanding-belts/cards/instagram/track-and-tension-sanding-belts-properly-sanding-belts.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/track-and-tension-sanding-belts-properly-sanding-belts/cards/instagram/track-and-tension-sanding-belts-properly-sanding-belts.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/track-and-tension-sanding-belts-properly-sanding-belts/cards/instagram/track-and-tension-sanding-belts-properly-sanding-belts.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/track-and-tension-sanding-belts-properly-sanding-belts/cards/pinterest/track-and-tension-sanding-belts-properly-sanding-belts.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/track-and-tension-sanding-belts-properly-sanding-belts/cards/pinterest/track-and-tension-sanding-belts-properly-sanding-belts.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/track-and-tension-sanding-belts-properly-sanding-belts/cards/pinterest/track-and-tension-sanding-belts-properly-sanding-belts.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/track-and-tension-sanding-belts-properly-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/track-and-tension-sanding-belts-properly-sanding-belts.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/track-and-tension-sanding-belts-properly-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/track-and-tension-sanding-belts-properly-sanding-belts.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/track-and-tension-sanding-belts-properly-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/track-and-tension-sanding-belts-properly-sanding-belts.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Grit Sequence For Wood Belt Sanding</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/grit-sequence-for-wood-belt-sanding-sanding-belts/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/grit-sequence-for-wood-belt-sanding-sanding-belts/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 04:05:03 +0000</pubDate><category>Sanding Belts &amp; Machines</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Master the optimal grit sequence for wood belt sanding.

&lt;p&gt;You notice it the moment the light angles in—those faint stripes that refuse to disappear, telegraphing through the first coat of finish like ghosted fingerprints. They’re the memory of rushed prep, of skipped grits and overheated passes. Anyone who has carried a tabletop into the sun and watched it betray a thousand micro-scratches knows the sting. Precision starts long before the finish can, and the most reliable way to get there is a disciplined grit sequence paired with the right sanding belts. Whether you run a 37-inch wide-belt sander in a small shop or rely on a handheld belt sander to flatten stubborn stock, the same physics apply: remove the deepest scratches with efficiency, generate finer, uniform scratches, and stop at the highest grit that supports your finish system without burnishing the surface.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/grit-sequence-for-wood-belt-sanding-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/grit-sequence-for-wood-belt-sanding-sanding-belts.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/grit-sequence-for-wood-belt-sanding-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/grit-sequence-for-wood-belt-sanding-sanding-belts.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/grit-sequence-for-wood-belt-sanding-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/grit-sequence-for-wood-belt-sanding-sanding-belts.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/grit-sequence-for-wood-belt-sanding-sanding-belts/cards/instagram/grit-sequence-for-wood-belt-sanding-sanding-belts.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/grit-sequence-for-wood-belt-sanding-sanding-belts/cards/instagram/grit-sequence-for-wood-belt-sanding-sanding-belts.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/grit-sequence-for-wood-belt-sanding-sanding-belts/cards/instagram/grit-sequence-for-wood-belt-sanding-sanding-belts.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/grit-sequence-for-wood-belt-sanding-sanding-belts/cards/pinterest/grit-sequence-for-wood-belt-sanding-sanding-belts.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/grit-sequence-for-wood-belt-sanding-sanding-belts/cards/pinterest/grit-sequence-for-wood-belt-sanding-sanding-belts.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/grit-sequence-for-wood-belt-sanding-sanding-belts/cards/pinterest/grit-sequence-for-wood-belt-sanding-sanding-belts.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/grit-sequence-for-wood-belt-sanding-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/grit-sequence-for-wood-belt-sanding-sanding-belts.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/grit-sequence-for-wood-belt-sanding-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/grit-sequence-for-wood-belt-sanding-sanding-belts.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/grit-sequence-for-wood-belt-sanding-sanding-belts/cards/facebook/grit-sequence-for-wood-belt-sanding-sanding-belts.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>13</readingTime></item></channel></rss>

&lt;p&gt;By the time the morning light sweeps across the hallway, every flaw in your trim becomes a quiet distraction: a chipped edge near the doorstop, a line of roller orange peel above the shoe molding, the glossy band where furniture grazed the baseboard. You run a fingertip along a suspect stretch of paint, and it feels slick, impervious—more like a plastic shell than something ready to bond with a fresh coat. It’s a moment many of us know: the desire to fix everything before the day gets busy, weighed against the fear of making it worse. That’s exactly where baseboard sanding earns its keep. It’s the technician’s shortcut to predictability—matting the sheen, leveling micro-defects, and creating a uniformly keyed surface that primer and enamel can actually bite into.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/29.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/02/best-grit-to-scuff-sand-previously-painted-baseboards-baseboard-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-to-scuff-sand-previously-painted-baseboards-baseboard-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/02/best-grit-to-scuff-sand-previously-painted-baseboards-baseboard-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-to-scuff-sand-previously-painted-baseboards-baseboard-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/02/best-grit-to-scuff-sand-previously-painted-baseboards-baseboard-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-to-scuff-sand-previously-painted-baseboards-baseboard-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/02/best-grit-to-scuff-sand-previously-painted-baseboards-baseboard-sanding/cards/instagram/best-grit-to-scuff-sand-previously-painted-baseboards-baseboard-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/02/best-grit-to-scuff-sand-previously-painted-baseboards-baseboard-sanding/cards/instagram/best-grit-to-scuff-sand-previously-painted-baseboards-baseboard-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/02/best-grit-to-scuff-sand-previously-painted-baseboards-baseboard-sanding/cards/instagram/best-grit-to-scuff-sand-previously-painted-baseboards-baseboard-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/02/best-grit-to-scuff-sand-previously-painted-baseboards-baseboard-sanding/cards/pinterest/best-grit-to-scuff-sand-previously-painted-baseboards-baseboard-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/02/best-grit-to-scuff-sand-previously-painted-baseboards-baseboard-sanding/cards/pinterest/best-grit-to-scuff-sand-previously-painted-baseboards-baseboard-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/02/best-grit-to-scuff-sand-previously-painted-baseboards-baseboard-sanding/cards/pinterest/best-grit-to-scuff-sand-previously-painted-baseboards-baseboard-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/02/best-grit-to-scuff-sand-previously-painted-baseboards-baseboard-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-to-scuff-sand-previously-painted-baseboards-baseboard-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/02/best-grit-to-scuff-sand-previously-painted-baseboards-baseboard-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-to-scuff-sand-previously-painted-baseboards-baseboard-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/02/best-grit-to-scuff-sand-previously-painted-baseboards-baseboard-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-to-scuff-sand-previously-painted-baseboards-baseboard-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Sanding Techniques For Curved And Detailed Molding</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/12/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/12/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 13:48:46 +0000</pubDate><category>Trim &amp; Molding Sanding</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>clear coat</category><category>orbital sander</category><category>sanding block</category><description>Learn expert molding sanding techniques for curved and detailed trim.

&lt;p&gt;The afternoon light hit the hallway just right—the kind of slant that makes crisp edges glow and tiny flaws stand out like little shadows. The old crown molding you’d decided to keep (and just refresh) looked less romantic up close: nicks where movers grazed it, soft ridges from past paint jobs, and a few dips where a power sander had been a touch too enthusiastic. You ran a fingertip along the ogee, felt a wave where a clean curve should be, and realized this was not a job for brute force. It was a job for patience and precision. If you’ve tried molding sanding before, you know the paradox: the more you try to fix a profile, the easier it is to flatten it.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/13.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/12/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding/cards/facebook/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/12/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding/cards/facebook/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/12/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding/cards/facebook/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/12/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding/cards/instagram/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/12/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding/cards/instagram/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/12/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding/cards/instagram/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/12/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding/cards/pinterest/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/12/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding/cards/pinterest/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/12/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding/cards/pinterest/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/12/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding/cards/facebook/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/12/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding/cards/facebook/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/12/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding/cards/facebook/sanding-techniques-for-curved-and-detailed-molding-molding-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>How To Scuff Sand Glossy Trim For Better Adhesion</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/23/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/23/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 14:56:24 +0000</pubDate><category>Trim &amp; Molding Sanding</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-360</category><category>grit-400</category><category>dust control</category><category>sanding block</category><description>Learn expert scuff-sanding techniques for glossy trim so paint sticks flawlessly.

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve ever run your fingers along a glossy window casing and thought, “There’s no way paint will stick to this,” you’re right—at least not for long without the right prep. I’ve walked into plenty of homes where a beautifully painted room is betrayed by peeling, nicked baseboards and door frames. The culprit is almost always the same: slippery, factory-smooth or oil-painted trim with zero mechanical bite. This is where trim sanding earns its keep. Done right, scuff sanding turns that slick plastic-like surface into a paint-friendly foundation that your primer and topcoat can lock onto.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/26.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/23/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/23/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/23/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/23/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding/cards/instagram/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/23/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding/cards/instagram/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/23/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding/cards/instagram/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/23/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/23/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/23/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/23/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/23/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/23/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-scuff-sand-glossy-trim-for-better-adhesion-trim-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Best Sanding Sponge Grit For Trim Surface Prep</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 07 Dec 2025 15:12:05 +0000</pubDate><category>Trim &amp; Molding Sanding</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-280</category><category>grit-320</category><category>dry sanding</category><category>sanding block</category><category>dust control</category><description>Engineer-tested guide to pick the best sponge for trim, from grit selection to technique, for flawless adhesion and smooth paint on wood and MDF.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="best-sponge-for-trim-sanding-grits-that-last"&gt;Best sponge for trim: sanding grits that last&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning light spilled across the hallway, revealing every chip and ridge along the baseboards that I’d stopped seeing months ago. The kind of small defects you only notice when you decide to fix them. I laid out the drop cloths and opened the can of trim enamel, mentally penciling in a half-day project. Then I reached for a sponge for trim instead of paper. That choice seems small, but it’s the difference between a paint job that looks good today and one that still looks good next year. As an engineer, I’ve learned that coatings fail at interfaces, not in the middle of the film. And the interface—the mechanical “tooth” you cut into the substrate—comes from your abrasives.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/10.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim/cards/facebook/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim/cards/facebook/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim/cards/facebook/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim/cards/instagram/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim/cards/instagram/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim/cards/instagram/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim/cards/pinterest/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim/cards/pinterest/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim/cards/pinterest/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim/cards/facebook/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim/cards/facebook/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim/cards/facebook/best-sanding-sponge-grit-for-trim-surface-prep-sponge-for-trim.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>How To Sand Detailed Trim Profiles Without Rounding Over</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 21 Nov 2025 14:57:21 +0000</pubDate><category>Trim &amp; Molding Sanding</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>dust control</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Engineer-tested methods for profile sanding detailed trim without rounding edges.

&lt;p&gt;A Saturday morning, coffee cooling on the bench, I’m staring at a stretch of 1920s casing that’s seen one too many paint jobs and a hard century of sun. The ogee still reads elegant from across the room, but up close the quirk line is softened and the fillet is barely a suggestion. I know the story because I’ve helped write versions of it: strip, sand, repaint — and somehow every pass with paper steals the edges that make the molding sing. The fear of rounding is why many pros dread profile sanding. It’s not the effort; it’s the risk of flattening crisp geometry that took a knife or cutter just seconds to define.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/25.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding/cards/instagram/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding/cards/instagram/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding/cards/instagram/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>How To Sand Baseboards Before Repainting Rooms</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-sand-baseboards-before-repainting-rooms-baseboard-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-sand-baseboards-before-repainting-rooms-baseboard-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2025 21:17:16 +0000</pubDate><category>Trim &amp; Molding Sanding</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>dust control</category><description>Learn expert baseboard sanding workflows for repainting: grit selection, tools, dust control, and pro prep steps for flawless trim coatings.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="baseboard-sanding-pro-workflow-for-repainting-rooms"&gt;Baseboard Sanding: Pro Workflow for Repainting Rooms&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The moment you move furniture, pull the drapes, and really look at your trim under morning light, the baseboards tell the story of the room. Years of shoes grazing the quarter round, vacuum scuffs where the wall meets the cap, and a glossy sheen that never quite cured right—these are the fingerprints of everyday life. The temptation is to tape a line and rush in with fresh paint. But in trim work, paint is only as good as the surface beneath it. Baseboard sanding is where a professional finish starts. It’s the quiet, meticulous part—deglossing hard alkyds so waterborne urethanes adhere, feathering raised chips until they disappear under primer, cutting micro-scratch patterns that promote uniform wetting. It’s dust extraction that protects your lungs and your topcoat, careful grit changes at the right moment, and an eye that knows when to repair versus when to replace.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/01.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-sand-baseboards-before-repainting-rooms-baseboard-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-baseboards-before-repainting-rooms-baseboard-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-sand-baseboards-before-repainting-rooms-baseboard-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-baseboards-before-repainting-rooms-baseboard-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-sand-baseboards-before-repainting-rooms-baseboard-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-baseboards-before-repainting-rooms-baseboard-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-sand-baseboards-before-repainting-rooms-baseboard-sanding/cards/instagram/how-to-sand-baseboards-before-repainting-rooms-baseboard-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-sand-baseboards-before-repainting-rooms-baseboard-sanding/cards/instagram/how-to-sand-baseboards-before-repainting-rooms-baseboard-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-sand-baseboards-before-repainting-rooms-baseboard-sanding/cards/instagram/how-to-sand-baseboards-before-repainting-rooms-baseboard-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-sand-baseboards-before-repainting-rooms-baseboard-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-to-sand-baseboards-before-repainting-rooms-baseboard-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-sand-baseboards-before-repainting-rooms-baseboard-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-to-sand-baseboards-before-repainting-rooms-baseboard-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-sand-baseboards-before-repainting-rooms-baseboard-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-to-sand-baseboards-before-repainting-rooms-baseboard-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-sand-baseboards-before-repainting-rooms-baseboard-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-baseboards-before-repainting-rooms-baseboard-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-sand-baseboards-before-repainting-rooms-baseboard-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-baseboards-before-repainting-rooms-baseboard-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-sand-baseboards-before-repainting-rooms-baseboard-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-baseboards-before-repainting-rooms-baseboard-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>How To Sand Crown Molding Profiles Without Flattening</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 04 Nov 2025 16:44:08 +0000</pubDate><category>Trim &amp; Molding Sanding</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>sanding block</category><category>primer coat</category><category>dust control</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Learn how to sand crown molding without flattening profiles.

&lt;p&gt;On a quiet Saturday morning, you finally pull the drop cloths over your living room floor and tilt a lamp toward the ceiling. The crown molding looks elegant from a distance, but up close the paint has chipped at the corners and the once-crisp beads have gone a little blurry. You run a fingertip along a cove that should feel like a clean arc, and instead it’s a soft bump. That’s the moment when most DIYers decide to sand—and the moment many profiles lose their sharp character. The goal isn’t to erase the molding’s shape; it’s to refine the surface. With a thoughtful approach to molding sanding, you can keep each flare, bead, and cove true while preparing for a flawless new finish.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding/cards/instagram/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding/cards/instagram/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding/cards/instagram/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>What Grit To Sand Interior Trim Before Painting</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/02/what-grit-to-sand-interior-trim-before-painting-trim-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/02/what-grit-to-sand-interior-trim-before-painting-trim-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 02 Nov 2025 20:12:53 +0000</pubDate><category>Trim &amp; Molding Sanding</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>sanding block</category><description>Discover expert tips on what grit to sand interior trim before painting.

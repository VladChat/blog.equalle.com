&lt;p&gt;A Saturday morning, coffee cooling on the bench, I’m staring at a stretch of 1920s casing that’s seen one too many paint jobs and a hard century of sun. The ogee still reads elegant from across the room, but up close the quirk line is softened and the fillet is barely a suggestion. I know the story because I’ve helped write versions of it: strip, sand, repaint — and somehow every pass with paper steals the edges that make the molding sing. The fear of rounding is why many pros dread profile sanding. It’s not the effort; it’s the risk of flattening crisp geometry that took a knife or cutter just seconds to define.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/25.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding/cards/instagram/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding/cards/instagram/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding/cards/instagram/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-detailed-trim-profiles-without-rounding-over-profile-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>How To Sand Baseboards Before Repainting Rooms</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-sand-baseboards-before-repainting-rooms-baseboard-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-sand-baseboards-before-repainting-rooms-baseboard-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2025 21:17:16 +0000</pubDate><category>Trim &amp; Molding Sanding</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>dust control</category><description>Learn expert baseboard sanding workflows for repainting: grit selection, tools, dust control, and pro prep steps for flawless trim coatings.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="baseboard-sanding-pro-workflow-for-repainting-rooms"&gt;Baseboard Sanding: Pro Workflow for Repainting Rooms&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The moment you move furniture, pull the drapes, and really look at your trim under morning light, the baseboards tell the story of the room. Years of shoes grazing the quarter round, vacuum scuffs where the wall meets the cap, and a glossy sheen that never quite cured right—these are the fingerprints of everyday life. The temptation is to tape a line and rush in with fresh paint. But in trim work, paint is only as good as the surface beneath it. Baseboard sanding is where a professional finish starts. It’s the quiet, meticulous part—deglossing hard alkyds so waterborne urethanes adhere, feathering raised chips until they disappear under primer, cutting micro-scratch patterns that promote uniform wetting. It’s dust extraction that protects your lungs and your topcoat, careful grit changes at the right moment, and an eye that knows when to repair versus when to replace.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/01.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-sand-baseboards-before-repainting-rooms-baseboard-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-baseboards-before-repainting-rooms-baseboard-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-sand-baseboards-before-repainting-rooms-baseboard-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-baseboards-before-repainting-rooms-baseboard-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-sand-baseboards-before-repainting-rooms-baseboard-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-baseboards-before-repainting-rooms-baseboard-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-sand-baseboards-before-repainting-rooms-baseboard-sanding/cards/instagram/how-to-sand-baseboards-before-repainting-rooms-baseboard-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-sand-baseboards-before-repainting-rooms-baseboard-sanding/cards/instagram/how-to-sand-baseboards-before-repainting-rooms-baseboard-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-sand-baseboards-before-repainting-rooms-baseboard-sanding/cards/instagram/how-to-sand-baseboards-before-repainting-rooms-baseboard-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-sand-baseboards-before-repainting-rooms-baseboard-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-to-sand-baseboards-before-repainting-rooms-baseboard-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-sand-baseboards-before-repainting-rooms-baseboard-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-to-sand-baseboards-before-repainting-rooms-baseboard-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-sand-baseboards-before-repainting-rooms-baseboard-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-to-sand-baseboards-before-repainting-rooms-baseboard-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-sand-baseboards-before-repainting-rooms-baseboard-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-baseboards-before-repainting-rooms-baseboard-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-sand-baseboards-before-repainting-rooms-baseboard-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-baseboards-before-repainting-rooms-baseboard-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-sand-baseboards-before-repainting-rooms-baseboard-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-baseboards-before-repainting-rooms-baseboard-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>How To Sand Crown Molding Profiles Without Flattening</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 04 Nov 2025 16:44:08 +0000</pubDate><category>Trim &amp; Molding Sanding</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>sanding block</category><category>primer coat</category><category>dust control</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Learn how to sand crown molding without flattening profiles.

&lt;p&gt;On a quiet Saturday morning, you finally pull the drop cloths over your living room floor and tilt a lamp toward the ceiling. The crown molding looks elegant from a distance, but up close the paint has chipped at the corners and the once-crisp beads have gone a little blurry. You run a fingertip along a cove that should feel like a clean arc, and instead it’s a soft bump. That’s the moment when most DIYers decide to sand—and the moment many profiles lose their sharp character. The goal isn’t to erase the molding’s shape; it’s to refine the surface. With a thoughtful approach to molding sanding, you can keep each flare, bead, and cove true while preparing for a flawless new finish.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding/cards/instagram/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding/cards/instagram/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding/cards/instagram/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding/cards/pinterest/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding/cards/facebook/how-to-sand-crown-molding-profiles-without-flattening-molding-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>What Grit To Sand Interior Trim Before Painting</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/02/what-grit-to-sand-interior-trim-before-painting-trim-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/02/what-grit-to-sand-interior-trim-before-painting-trim-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 02 Nov 2025 20:12:53 +0000</pubDate><category>Trim &amp; Molding Sanding</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>sanding block</category><description>Discover expert tips on what grit to sand interior trim before painting.

You&amp;rsquo;ve set your sights on the dated, chipped trim in your living room, envisioning a fresh coat of paint to breathe new life into the space.

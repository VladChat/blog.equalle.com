&lt;p&gt;The shop was quiet except for the gentle hum of the dust extractor and the tick of cooling lights. I’d just laid the final coat on a black cabinet door—high-gloss lacquer, deep and mirror-like. It looked perfect under the booth lamps… until I rolled it into raking light. There they were: tiny raised specks scattered like stars—dust nibs. No drama, no panic. I’ve been here before. This is where an ultra fine sanding sponge earns its keep. It doesn’t scream for attention like a sander or a buffer; it just quietly, precisely knocks down the dots that ruin a perfect finish.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/07.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge/cards/instagram/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge/cards/instagram/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge/cards/instagram/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge/cards/pinterest/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge/cards/pinterest/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge/cards/pinterest/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/11/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/denibbing-with-ultra-fine-sponge-abrasives-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Sponge Versus Paper On Curved Surfaces</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 15:39:58 +0000</pubDate><category>Sanding Sponges</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>grit progression</category><category>sanding block</category><category>dust control</category><description>Learn when a sanding sponge outperforms paper on curves.

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve ever stood in your garage at 9 p.m., holding a cup of coffee with one hand and a carved table leg with the other, you know the moment: the curve looks great until you touch it with the wrong abrasive. Flat spots appear, sharp lines soften, and suddenly the piece loses the crisp profile you loved. I’ve been there countless times—chair arms, bowl rims, crown molding returns—each one begging for finesse. The first time I switched from paper to a sanding sponge mid-project, it felt like I’d finally turned down the static and could hear the wood speaking again. The foam hugged the profile, didn’t dig in, and let me smooth without erasing detail.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/22.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge/cards/instagram/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge/cards/instagram/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge/cards/instagram/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge/cards/pinterest/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge/cards/pinterest/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge/cards/pinterest/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/25/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/sponge-versus-paper-on-curved-surfaces-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>13</readingTime></item><item><title>Scuff Sand Between Coats With A Sponge</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 14 Nov 2025 06:26:49 +0000</pubDate><category>Sanding Sponges</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><description>Engineer-tested guide to scuff sanding between coats using a sanding sponge—grit, pressure, foam chemistry, and pro tips for flawless finishes.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="how-to-scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sanding-sponge"&gt;How to Scuff Sand Between Coats with a Sanding Sponge&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first coat looked perfect under shop lights—glossy, mirror-like, promising. Then morning sunlight cut across the panel and told the truth: a few dust nibs, a faint orange peel near the edge, and the slightest ripple where the grain lifted. I’ve been there more times than I’ll admit. The urge is to lay on more finish and hope it “levels out,” but finishing rarely rewards wishful thinking. What fixes it—quietly, consistently—is a simple pass with a sanding sponge.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/06.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge/cards/instagram/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge/cards/instagram/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge/cards/instagram/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge/cards/pinterest/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge/cards/pinterest/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge/cards/pinterest/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/scuff-sand-between-coats-with-a-sponge-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Washable Sanding Sponges For Longer Life</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 05 Nov 2025 16:30:43 +0000</pubDate><category>Sanding Sponges</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><description>Extend abrasive life with washable sanding sponges.

&lt;p&gt;You can hear it before you feel it: that faint change in pitch as a loaded abrasive skates across the surface rather than cutting it. In a small garage shop on a drizzly Saturday, a cabinetmaker pauses mid-pass, lifting his sanding sponge to the light. The face is clogged with a pale paste—sawdust and finish residue compacted into the foam’s pores. He hasn’t even reached final grit, but the cutting action is gone and heat is creeping in. In the past, this was when he would toss the sponge and reach for a new one, the cost quietly accumulating with every project. Today, he walks to the sink, rinses the sponge under lukewarm water, massages the face with a nylon brush, and watches the slurry shed away. Thirty seconds later, the abrasive bites again, the cut is cool and even, and the workflow stays on tempo.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge/cards/instagram/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge/cards/instagram/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge/cards/instagram/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge/cards/pinterest/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge/cards/pinterest/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge/cards/pinterest/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/washable-sanding-sponges-for-longer-life-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Best Grit Sponges For Trim And Profiles</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/best-grit-sponges-for-trim-and-profiles-sanding-sponge/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/best-grit-sponges-for-trim-and-profiles-sanding-sponge/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 03:21:23 +0000</pubDate><category>Sanding Sponges</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-600</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>Find the best sanding sponge grits for trim and profiles.

&lt;p&gt;The first time you notice your trim is when it looks wrong. It might be the sunlight clipping across a paneled door at mid-morning, suddenly revealing raised brush lines, tiny dust nibs, and a few mystery divots at the chair rail. Or maybe it’s the crown molding you’ve always loved, now dulled by a hundred handprints and the quiet scrapes of a step ladder. That’s the moment: when care meets craft. You want your woodwork to feel clean and precise, to show off the curves and profiles rather than the flaws. And that’s when a simple, overlooked tool quietly becomes essential—the sanding sponge.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/best-grit-sponges-for-trim-and-profiles-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/best-grit-sponges-for-trim-and-profiles-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/best-grit-sponges-for-trim-and-profiles-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/best-grit-sponges-for-trim-and-profiles-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/best-grit-sponges-for-trim-and-profiles-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/best-grit-sponges-for-trim-and-profiles-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/best-grit-sponges-for-trim-and-profiles-sanding-sponge/cards/instagram/best-grit-sponges-for-trim-and-profiles-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/best-grit-sponges-for-trim-and-profiles-sanding-sponge/cards/instagram/best-grit-sponges-for-trim-and-profiles-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/best-grit-sponges-for-trim-and-profiles-sanding-sponge/cards/instagram/best-grit-sponges-for-trim-and-profiles-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/best-grit-sponges-for-trim-and-profiles-sanding-sponge/cards/pinterest/best-grit-sponges-for-trim-and-profiles-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/best-grit-sponges-for-trim-and-profiles-sanding-sponge/cards/pinterest/best-grit-sponges-for-trim-and-profiles-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/best-grit-sponges-for-trim-and-profiles-sanding-sponge/cards/pinterest/best-grit-sponges-for-trim-and-profiles-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/best-grit-sponges-for-trim-and-profiles-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/best-grit-sponges-for-trim-and-profiles-sanding-sponge.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/best-grit-sponges-for-trim-and-profiles-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/best-grit-sponges-for-trim-and-profiles-sanding-sponge.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/best-grit-sponges-for-trim-and-profiles-sanding-sponge/cards/facebook/best-grit-sponges-for-trim-and-profiles-sanding-sponge.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item></channel></rss>

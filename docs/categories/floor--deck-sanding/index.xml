&lt;p&gt;The afternoon light slid across your living room, catching the raw promise of bare wood. You’d pulled the last nail out, rented the big-machine sander, and felt that satisfying hum as years of finish lifted away in long, clean passes. The field of the floor looked even—linear, disciplined, almost new. Then your eyes drifted to the perimeter, that six to twelve inches along the baseboards where the drum could never reach. There, the grain looked different. A shadowy ring—soft at first—seemed to appear, like a halo you couldn’t unsee.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/14.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/edge-sanding-sequence-to-match-the-drum-sander-scratch-edger-sanding/cards/facebook/edge-sanding-sequence-to-match-the-drum-sander-scratch-edger-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/edge-sanding-sequence-to-match-the-drum-sander-scratch-edger-sanding/cards/facebook/edge-sanding-sequence-to-match-the-drum-sander-scratch-edger-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/edge-sanding-sequence-to-match-the-drum-sander-scratch-edger-sanding/cards/facebook/edge-sanding-sequence-to-match-the-drum-sander-scratch-edger-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/edge-sanding-sequence-to-match-the-drum-sander-scratch-edger-sanding/cards/instagram/edge-sanding-sequence-to-match-the-drum-sander-scratch-edger-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/edge-sanding-sequence-to-match-the-drum-sander-scratch-edger-sanding/cards/instagram/edge-sanding-sequence-to-match-the-drum-sander-scratch-edger-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/edge-sanding-sequence-to-match-the-drum-sander-scratch-edger-sanding/cards/instagram/edge-sanding-sequence-to-match-the-drum-sander-scratch-edger-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/edge-sanding-sequence-to-match-the-drum-sander-scratch-edger-sanding/cards/pinterest/edge-sanding-sequence-to-match-the-drum-sander-scratch-edger-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/edge-sanding-sequence-to-match-the-drum-sander-scratch-edger-sanding/cards/pinterest/edge-sanding-sequence-to-match-the-drum-sander-scratch-edger-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/edge-sanding-sequence-to-match-the-drum-sander-scratch-edger-sanding/cards/pinterest/edge-sanding-sequence-to-match-the-drum-sander-scratch-edger-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/edge-sanding-sequence-to-match-the-drum-sander-scratch-edger-sanding/cards/facebook/edge-sanding-sequence-to-match-the-drum-sander-scratch-edger-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/edge-sanding-sequence-to-match-the-drum-sander-scratch-edger-sanding/cards/facebook/edge-sanding-sequence-to-match-the-drum-sander-scratch-edger-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/edge-sanding-sequence-to-match-the-drum-sander-scratch-edger-sanding/cards/facebook/edge-sanding-sequence-to-match-the-drum-sander-scratch-edger-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>How To Use A Drum Sander Without Gouging The Floor</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/how-to-use-a-drum-sander-without-gouging-the-floor-drum-sander/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/how-to-use-a-drum-sander-without-gouging-the-floor-drum-sander/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 22 Nov 2025 00:17:02 +0000</pubDate><category>Floor &amp; Deck Sanding</category><category>grit-40</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>dust control</category><category>dry sanding</category><category>orbital sander</category><description>Learn how to use a drum sander safely and smoothly to refinish hardwood floors without gouges, from setup and technique to edges, dust, and final prep.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="how-to-use-a-drum-sander-without-gouging-floors"&gt;How to Use a Drum Sander Without Gouging Floors&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a specific quiet that fills the house once the furniture is moved and the rugs are rolled away. You stand in that new emptiness and see every scuff and dent that daily life has pressed into your hardwood—sun-faded planks by the windows, chair-leg tracks under the table, and a dark, worn path that arcs toward the kitchen. Maybe you’ve watched a few videos and read some forum threads, and now the rental center’s phone number is staring you down. The idea of a sparkling new finish is thrilling. The idea of gouging the floor with a poorly handled drum sander? Not so much.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/29.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/how-to-use-a-drum-sander-without-gouging-the-floor-drum-sander/cards/facebook/how-to-use-a-drum-sander-without-gouging-the-floor-drum-sander.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/how-to-use-a-drum-sander-without-gouging-the-floor-drum-sander/cards/facebook/how-to-use-a-drum-sander-without-gouging-the-floor-drum-sander.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/how-to-use-a-drum-sander-without-gouging-the-floor-drum-sander/cards/facebook/how-to-use-a-drum-sander-without-gouging-the-floor-drum-sander.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/how-to-use-a-drum-sander-without-gouging-the-floor-drum-sander/cards/instagram/how-to-use-a-drum-sander-without-gouging-the-floor-drum-sander.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/how-to-use-a-drum-sander-without-gouging-the-floor-drum-sander/cards/instagram/how-to-use-a-drum-sander-without-gouging-the-floor-drum-sander.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/how-to-use-a-drum-sander-without-gouging-the-floor-drum-sander/cards/instagram/how-to-use-a-drum-sander-without-gouging-the-floor-drum-sander.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/how-to-use-a-drum-sander-without-gouging-the-floor-drum-sander/cards/pinterest/how-to-use-a-drum-sander-without-gouging-the-floor-drum-sander.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/how-to-use-a-drum-sander-without-gouging-the-floor-drum-sander/cards/pinterest/how-to-use-a-drum-sander-without-gouging-the-floor-drum-sander.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/how-to-use-a-drum-sander-without-gouging-the-floor-drum-sander/cards/pinterest/how-to-use-a-drum-sander-without-gouging-the-floor-drum-sander.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/how-to-use-a-drum-sander-without-gouging-the-floor-drum-sander/cards/facebook/how-to-use-a-drum-sander-without-gouging-the-floor-drum-sander.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/how-to-use-a-drum-sander-without-gouging-the-floor-drum-sander/cards/facebook/how-to-use-a-drum-sander-without-gouging-the-floor-drum-sander.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/22/how-to-use-a-drum-sander-without-gouging-the-floor-drum-sander/cards/facebook/how-to-use-a-drum-sander-without-gouging-the-floor-drum-sander.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>13</readingTime></item><item><title>Moisture And Acclimation Checks Before Floor Sanding</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/moisture-and-acclimation-checks-before-floor-sanding-wood-floor-prep/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/moisture-and-acclimation-checks-before-floor-sanding-wood-floor-prep/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2025 21:54:27 +0000</pubDate><category>Floor &amp; Deck Sanding</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-220</category><category>dry sanding</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Moisture and acclimation checks for wood floor prep.

&lt;p&gt;The first time I heard a moisture meter beep in an empty living room, I knew my weekend “quick sand and coat” wasn’t going to be quick at all. Sunlight was warming the boards by the patio door, the HVAC was off to save a few bucks, and the floor felt flat. But wood doesn’t ask how it feels—it tells you through movement. That morning, I leaned on the handle of my drum sander and thought about the real beginning of any wood floor prep: knowing where the moisture sits, where it’s heading, and whether the room’s climate matches the life the floor will live after you’re done. If you’ve ever watched stain turn blotchy, or a new finish develop white lines at board edges, you’ve met moisture the hard way.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/13.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/moisture-and-acclimation-checks-before-floor-sanding-wood-floor-prep/cards/facebook/moisture-and-acclimation-checks-before-floor-sanding-wood-floor-prep.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/moisture-and-acclimation-checks-before-floor-sanding-wood-floor-prep/cards/facebook/moisture-and-acclimation-checks-before-floor-sanding-wood-floor-prep.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/moisture-and-acclimation-checks-before-floor-sanding-wood-floor-prep/cards/facebook/moisture-and-acclimation-checks-before-floor-sanding-wood-floor-prep.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/moisture-and-acclimation-checks-before-floor-sanding-wood-floor-prep/cards/instagram/moisture-and-acclimation-checks-before-floor-sanding-wood-floor-prep.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/moisture-and-acclimation-checks-before-floor-sanding-wood-floor-prep/cards/instagram/moisture-and-acclimation-checks-before-floor-sanding-wood-floor-prep.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/moisture-and-acclimation-checks-before-floor-sanding-wood-floor-prep/cards/instagram/moisture-and-acclimation-checks-before-floor-sanding-wood-floor-prep.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/moisture-and-acclimation-checks-before-floor-sanding-wood-floor-prep/cards/pinterest/moisture-and-acclimation-checks-before-floor-sanding-wood-floor-prep.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/moisture-and-acclimation-checks-before-floor-sanding-wood-floor-prep/cards/pinterest/moisture-and-acclimation-checks-before-floor-sanding-wood-floor-prep.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/moisture-and-acclimation-checks-before-floor-sanding-wood-floor-prep/cards/pinterest/moisture-and-acclimation-checks-before-floor-sanding-wood-floor-prep.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/moisture-and-acclimation-checks-before-floor-sanding-wood-floor-prep/cards/facebook/moisture-and-acclimation-checks-before-floor-sanding-wood-floor-prep.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/moisture-and-acclimation-checks-before-floor-sanding-wood-floor-prep/cards/facebook/moisture-and-acclimation-checks-before-floor-sanding-wood-floor-prep.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/moisture-and-acclimation-checks-before-floor-sanding-wood-floor-prep/cards/facebook/moisture-and-acclimation-checks-before-floor-sanding-wood-floor-prep.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Best Grit For Deck Sanding Before Staining</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/best-grit-for-deck-sanding-before-staining-deck-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/best-grit-for-deck-sanding-before-staining-deck-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 04 Nov 2025 19:32:49 +0000</pubDate><category>Floor &amp; Deck Sanding</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-320</category><category>deck sanding</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Engineer-tested guide to the best grit for deck sanding before staining, with abrasive science, tool choices, and proven sanding sequences.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="best-grit-for-deck-sanding-before-staining"&gt;Best Grit for Deck Sanding Before Staining&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning sunlight hits the deck and it looks like two decks at once: the cheerful gathering place you want for the season ahead, and the weathered surface you’ve come to ignore—grayed, patchy stain, a couple of raised splinters in the traffic lane from the back door. If you’ve decided to refresh it, you’ll run into a deceptively technical question right away: what’s the best grit for deck sanding before staining? As a product engineer who field-tests tools and abrasives, I’ve learned that grit choice isn’t a cosmetic preference—it’s a performance variable that decides how well stain bonds, how evenly it soaks, and how long your finish resists UV and foot traffic. In deck sanding, you aren’t polishing furniture; you’re tuning the surface profile to balance penetration and smoothness.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/best-grit-for-deck-sanding-before-staining-deck-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-for-deck-sanding-before-staining-deck-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/best-grit-for-deck-sanding-before-staining-deck-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-for-deck-sanding-before-staining-deck-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/best-grit-for-deck-sanding-before-staining-deck-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-for-deck-sanding-before-staining-deck-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/best-grit-for-deck-sanding-before-staining-deck-sanding/cards/instagram/best-grit-for-deck-sanding-before-staining-deck-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/best-grit-for-deck-sanding-before-staining-deck-sanding/cards/instagram/best-grit-for-deck-sanding-before-staining-deck-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/best-grit-for-deck-sanding-before-staining-deck-sanding/cards/instagram/best-grit-for-deck-sanding-before-staining-deck-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/best-grit-for-deck-sanding-before-staining-deck-sanding/cards/pinterest/best-grit-for-deck-sanding-before-staining-deck-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/best-grit-for-deck-sanding-before-staining-deck-sanding/cards/pinterest/best-grit-for-deck-sanding-before-staining-deck-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/best-grit-for-deck-sanding-before-staining-deck-sanding/cards/pinterest/best-grit-for-deck-sanding-before-staining-deck-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/best-grit-for-deck-sanding-before-staining-deck-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-for-deck-sanding-before-staining-deck-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/best-grit-for-deck-sanding-before-staining-deck-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-for-deck-sanding-before-staining-deck-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/best-grit-for-deck-sanding-before-staining-deck-sanding/cards/facebook/best-grit-for-deck-sanding-before-staining-deck-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Best Grit Sequence For Hardwood Floor Sanding</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/02/best-grit-sequence-for-hardwood-floor-sanding-floor-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/02/best-grit-sequence-for-hardwood-floor-sanding-floor-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 02 Nov 2025 21:13:10 +0000</pubDate><category>Floor &amp; Deck Sanding</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Discover the ultimate grit sequence for hardwood floor sanding to achieve smooth, professional results in your DIY projects.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="best-grit-sequence-for-hardwood-floor-sanding"&gt;Best Grit Sequence for Hardwood Floor Sanding&lt;/h2&gt;

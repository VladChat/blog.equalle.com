&lt;p&gt;Saturday light hits the dining table just right, and that’s both a blessing and a curse. You can see everything: the tiny crater where a laptop corner sank into soft oak during a late-night email sprint, the ghostly white ring from a forgotten coffee mug, the faint scratch where a science project met an impatient sponge. These are the little scars of a life well-lived—until you decide it’s time to refinish. As a workshop guy who lives for clean joins, crisp edges, and silky finishes, I’ve learned that great furniture restoration lives or dies before you ever open a finish can. If you don’t fix dents and lift white rings properly, your “new finish” just spotlights old mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/11.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration/cards/facebook/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration/cards/facebook/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration/cards/facebook/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration/cards/instagram/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration/cards/instagram/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration/cards/instagram/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration/cards/pinterest/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration/cards/pinterest/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration/cards/pinterest/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration/cards/facebook/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration/cards/facebook/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/11/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration/cards/facebook/fix-dents-and-white-rings-before-applying-new-finish-furniture-restoration.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Strip Or Sand First When Refinishing Furniture Pieces</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/23/strip-or-sand-first-when-refinishing-furniture-pieces-furniture-refinishing/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/23/strip-or-sand-first-when-refinishing-furniture-pieces-furniture-refinishing/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 13:41:01 +0000</pubDate><category>Furniture Refinishing</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Engineer-tested guide on whether to strip or sand first in furniture refinishing, with abrasive science, timing data, and practical workflows.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="strip-or-sand-first-in-furniture-refinishing"&gt;Strip or Sand First in Furniture Refinishing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a cool Saturday morning, I pulled a walnut end table out of an estate-sale pile and set it on sawhorses. Sunlight revealed a familiar crime scene: worn edges, water rings, and a thick amber film that felt rubbery under my fingernail. The decision every restorer faces came next—do I strip the finish chemically or start sanding? In furniture refinishing, that single choice sets the tone for your entire project: speed, mess, surface quality, and even whether you’ll preserve crisp details or blunt them away.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/24.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/23/strip-or-sand-first-when-refinishing-furniture-pieces-furniture-refinishing/cards/facebook/strip-or-sand-first-when-refinishing-furniture-pieces-furniture-refinishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/23/strip-or-sand-first-when-refinishing-furniture-pieces-furniture-refinishing/cards/facebook/strip-or-sand-first-when-refinishing-furniture-pieces-furniture-refinishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/23/strip-or-sand-first-when-refinishing-furniture-pieces-furniture-refinishing/cards/facebook/strip-or-sand-first-when-refinishing-furniture-pieces-furniture-refinishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/23/strip-or-sand-first-when-refinishing-furniture-pieces-furniture-refinishing/cards/instagram/strip-or-sand-first-when-refinishing-furniture-pieces-furniture-refinishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/23/strip-or-sand-first-when-refinishing-furniture-pieces-furniture-refinishing/cards/instagram/strip-or-sand-first-when-refinishing-furniture-pieces-furniture-refinishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/23/strip-or-sand-first-when-refinishing-furniture-pieces-furniture-refinishing/cards/instagram/strip-or-sand-first-when-refinishing-furniture-pieces-furniture-refinishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/23/strip-or-sand-first-when-refinishing-furniture-pieces-furniture-refinishing/cards/pinterest/strip-or-sand-first-when-refinishing-furniture-pieces-furniture-refinishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/23/strip-or-sand-first-when-refinishing-furniture-pieces-furniture-refinishing/cards/pinterest/strip-or-sand-first-when-refinishing-furniture-pieces-furniture-refinishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/23/strip-or-sand-first-when-refinishing-furniture-pieces-furniture-refinishing/cards/pinterest/strip-or-sand-first-when-refinishing-furniture-pieces-furniture-refinishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/23/strip-or-sand-first-when-refinishing-furniture-pieces-furniture-refinishing/cards/facebook/strip-or-sand-first-when-refinishing-furniture-pieces-furniture-refinishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/23/strip-or-sand-first-when-refinishing-furniture-pieces-furniture-refinishing/cards/facebook/strip-or-sand-first-when-refinishing-furniture-pieces-furniture-refinishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/23/strip-or-sand-first-when-refinishing-furniture-pieces-furniture-refinishing/cards/facebook/strip-or-sand-first-when-refinishing-furniture-pieces-furniture-refinishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>What Grit To Sand Furniture Before Applying Stain</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 07 Dec 2025 13:31:13 +0000</pubDate><category>Furniture Refinishing</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-800</category><category>orbital sander</category><category>sanding block</category><category>dust control</category><description>Learn the exact sanding grits, workflows, and checks that drive even stain color and professional results on furniture projects.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="stain-preparation-what-grit-to-sand-furniture"&gt;Stain Preparation: What Grit to Sand Furniture&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a quiet Saturday morning, you clear the dining table and pull the tarp tight. The surface is a patchwork of rings, scratches, and a few mystery stains from a previous life—nothing that an orbital sander and a little patience can’t fix. The smell of sawdust arrives quickly, and with it a deceptively simple choice: what grit to sand furniture before applying stain. There are plenty of opinions, but only one proper sequence for your species, stain type, and condition of the substrate. That decision—more than the brand of stain or even your brushing technique—will decide whether the grain pops evenly or blotches, whether the edges stay crisp or burn through, and whether your topcoat glides over a consistent scratch pattern or amplifies every swirl mark. Done right, stain preparation becomes a repeatable, almost meditative routine that pays off with reliable, beautiful finishes.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/08.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation/cards/facebook/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation/cards/facebook/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation/cards/facebook/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation/cards/instagram/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation/cards/instagram/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation/cards/instagram/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation/cards/pinterest/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation/cards/pinterest/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation/cards/pinterest/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation/cards/facebook/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation/cards/facebook/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/07/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation/cards/facebook/what-grit-to-sand-furniture-before-applying-stain-stain-preparation.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>How To Apply Grain Filler On Open Pore Woods Like Oak</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 21 Nov 2025 13:33:23 +0000</pubDate><category>Furniture Refinishing</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>orbital sander</category><description>Learn precise grain filling for oak: abrasives, sanding workflow, filler selection, and application to achieve a glass-smooth finish on open-pore woods.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="grain-filling-oak-pro-sanding-and-filler-workflow"&gt;Grain Filling Oak: Pro Sanding and Filler Workflow&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a moment every woodworker recognizes: fingertips tracing a new oak tabletop, catching on the earlywood valleys that step across the surface like tiny terraces. Under shop lights, the finish looks glossy, almost perfect—until the raking light at sunrise reveals a topography of pores telegraphing through the film. That’s when grain filling stops being a nice-to-have and becomes a requirement. On open-pore woods like oak, ash, and mahogany, achieving a piano-flat finish asks for a deliberate sequence: correct abrasive selection, controlled scratch management, filler chemistry that matches your topcoat, and disciplined leveling. Skip any step and the pores will betray your shortcuts weeks later.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/23.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling/cards/facebook/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling/cards/facebook/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling/cards/facebook/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling/cards/instagram/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling/cards/instagram/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling/cards/instagram/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling/cards/pinterest/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling/cards/pinterest/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling/cards/pinterest/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling/cards/facebook/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling/cards/facebook/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/21/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling/cards/facebook/how-to-apply-grain-filler-on-open-pore-woods-like-oak-grain-filling.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>How To Remove Polyurethane Or Varnish Safely From Furniture</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-remove-polyurethane-or-varnish-safely-from-furniture-wood-finish-removal/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-remove-polyurethane-or-varnish-safely-from-furniture-wood-finish-removal/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2025 18:54:49 +0000</pubDate><category>Furniture Refinishing</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit progression</category><category>orbital sander</category><description>Learn safe, practical wood finish removal for furniture—strip polyurethane or varnish without damage.

&lt;p&gt;It starts as a quiet, hopeful Saturday morning. You slide open a drawer on a hand-me-down dresser and the runners squeak just slightly—an honest sound, softened by decades of use. The wood is beautiful under the glare of a shiny, ambered topcoat, but the gloss is cracked in places and the color has drifted toward orange. You imagine this piece lightened, its grain breathing again, ready for a new finish that fits your home today. There’s just one thing between you and that vision: the practical reality of wood finish removal. You’ve heard horror stories about harsh chemicals, gummy messes, and hours of sanding that erase crisp edges. You’ve also heard promises about citrus strippers and miracle gels. Somewhere between the extremes sits a safe, effective path—one that respects both your health and the furniture’s history.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-remove-polyurethane-or-varnish-safely-from-furniture-wood-finish-removal/cards/facebook/how-to-remove-polyurethane-or-varnish-safely-from-furniture-wood-finish-removal.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-remove-polyurethane-or-varnish-safely-from-furniture-wood-finish-removal/cards/facebook/how-to-remove-polyurethane-or-varnish-safely-from-furniture-wood-finish-removal.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-remove-polyurethane-or-varnish-safely-from-furniture-wood-finish-removal/cards/facebook/how-to-remove-polyurethane-or-varnish-safely-from-furniture-wood-finish-removal.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-remove-polyurethane-or-varnish-safely-from-furniture-wood-finish-removal/cards/instagram/how-to-remove-polyurethane-or-varnish-safely-from-furniture-wood-finish-removal.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-remove-polyurethane-or-varnish-safely-from-furniture-wood-finish-removal/cards/instagram/how-to-remove-polyurethane-or-varnish-safely-from-furniture-wood-finish-removal.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-remove-polyurethane-or-varnish-safely-from-furniture-wood-finish-removal/cards/instagram/how-to-remove-polyurethane-or-varnish-safely-from-furniture-wood-finish-removal.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-remove-polyurethane-or-varnish-safely-from-furniture-wood-finish-removal/cards/pinterest/how-to-remove-polyurethane-or-varnish-safely-from-furniture-wood-finish-removal.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-remove-polyurethane-or-varnish-safely-from-furniture-wood-finish-removal/cards/pinterest/how-to-remove-polyurethane-or-varnish-safely-from-furniture-wood-finish-removal.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-remove-polyurethane-or-varnish-safely-from-furniture-wood-finish-removal/cards/pinterest/how-to-remove-polyurethane-or-varnish-safely-from-furniture-wood-finish-removal.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-remove-polyurethane-or-varnish-safely-from-furniture-wood-finish-removal/cards/facebook/how-to-remove-polyurethane-or-varnish-safely-from-furniture-wood-finish-removal.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-remove-polyurethane-or-varnish-safely-from-furniture-wood-finish-removal/cards/facebook/how-to-remove-polyurethane-or-varnish-safely-from-furniture-wood-finish-removal.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/10/how-to-remove-polyurethane-or-varnish-safely-from-furniture-wood-finish-removal/cards/facebook/how-to-remove-polyurethane-or-varnish-safely-from-furniture-wood-finish-removal.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>How To Repair Chipped Or Lifting Veneer Before Refinishing</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-repair-chipped-or-lifting-veneer-before-refinishing-furniture-restoration/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-repair-chipped-or-lifting-veneer-before-refinishing-furniture-restoration/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 04 Nov 2025 15:40:12 +0000</pubDate><category>Furniture Refinishing</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-1000</category><description>Learn how to repair chipped or lifting veneer before refinishing.

&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning, shop lights warm, coffee cooling on the bench. I slide a hand over a walnut dresser that’s outlived two generations. It has presence—clean lines, true drawers, the kind of proportions you can’t fake—but the veneer tells a rougher story. One front edge is chipped back to the substrate.

You could pass this piece over at a thrift store and never know what it could become. Or you can see it for what it is: a solid candidate for furniture restoration with a few smart, careful veneer repairs.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-repair-chipped-or-lifting-veneer-before-refinishing-furniture-restoration/cards/facebook/how-to-repair-chipped-or-lifting-veneer-before-refinishing-furniture-restoration.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-repair-chipped-or-lifting-veneer-before-refinishing-furniture-restoration/cards/facebook/how-to-repair-chipped-or-lifting-veneer-before-refinishing-furniture-restoration.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-repair-chipped-or-lifting-veneer-before-refinishing-furniture-restoration/cards/facebook/how-to-repair-chipped-or-lifting-veneer-before-refinishing-furniture-restoration.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-repair-chipped-or-lifting-veneer-before-refinishing-furniture-restoration/cards/instagram/how-to-repair-chipped-or-lifting-veneer-before-refinishing-furniture-restoration.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-repair-chipped-or-lifting-veneer-before-refinishing-furniture-restoration/cards/instagram/how-to-repair-chipped-or-lifting-veneer-before-refinishing-furniture-restoration.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-repair-chipped-or-lifting-veneer-before-refinishing-furniture-restoration/cards/instagram/how-to-repair-chipped-or-lifting-veneer-before-refinishing-furniture-restoration.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-repair-chipped-or-lifting-veneer-before-refinishing-furniture-restoration/cards/pinterest/how-to-repair-chipped-or-lifting-veneer-before-refinishing-furniture-restoration.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-repair-chipped-or-lifting-veneer-before-refinishing-furniture-restoration/cards/pinterest/how-to-repair-chipped-or-lifting-veneer-before-refinishing-furniture-restoration.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-repair-chipped-or-lifting-veneer-before-refinishing-furniture-restoration/cards/pinterest/how-to-repair-chipped-or-lifting-veneer-before-refinishing-furniture-restoration.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-repair-chipped-or-lifting-veneer-before-refinishing-furniture-restoration/cards/facebook/how-to-repair-chipped-or-lifting-veneer-before-refinishing-furniture-restoration.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-repair-chipped-or-lifting-veneer-before-refinishing-furniture-restoration/cards/facebook/how-to-repair-chipped-or-lifting-veneer-before-refinishing-furniture-restoration.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/how-to-repair-chipped-or-lifting-veneer-before-refinishing-furniture-restoration/cards/facebook/how-to-repair-chipped-or-lifting-veneer-before-refinishing-furniture-restoration.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Step By Step Furniture Refinishing Process At Home</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/02/step-by-step-furniture-refinishing-process-at-home-furniture-refinishing/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/02/step-by-step-furniture-refinishing-process-at-home-furniture-refinishing/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 02 Nov 2025 18:44:29 +0000</pubDate><category>Furniture Refinishing</category><category>sanding block</category><description>Learn how to refinish furniture at home with expert tips, detailed steps, and practical advice for a professional finish every time.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="mastering-furniture-refinishing-at-home"&gt;Mastering Furniture Refinishing at Home&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine stepping into your living room and spotting that beloved wooden coffee table, an old family heirloom with memories etched into every scratch and scuff.

&lt;p&gt;The moment you flip on a bright desk lamp is when the truth comes out. A pendant you poured, sanded, and buffed over a quiet weekend looks flawless under normal room light. But under that focused beam, faint fog appears along the edges. Micro-swirls show up in arcs you didn’t notice before. A tiny speck you thought you removed winks back at you. If you’ve tried resin polishing even a few times, you’ve seen this: strong light is uncompromising. It magnifies every scratch, ripple, and residue, turning a “good” finish into one you’re not quite ready to sign your name to.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/18.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/check-clarity-under-strong-lighting-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/check-clarity-under-strong-lighting-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/check-clarity-under-strong-lighting-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/check-clarity-under-strong-lighting-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/check-clarity-under-strong-lighting-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/check-clarity-under-strong-lighting-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/check-clarity-under-strong-lighting-resin-polishing/cards/instagram/check-clarity-under-strong-lighting-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/check-clarity-under-strong-lighting-resin-polishing/cards/instagram/check-clarity-under-strong-lighting-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/check-clarity-under-strong-lighting-resin-polishing/cards/instagram/check-clarity-under-strong-lighting-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/check-clarity-under-strong-lighting-resin-polishing/cards/pinterest/check-clarity-under-strong-lighting-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/check-clarity-under-strong-lighting-resin-polishing/cards/pinterest/check-clarity-under-strong-lighting-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/check-clarity-under-strong-lighting-resin-polishing/cards/pinterest/check-clarity-under-strong-lighting-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/check-clarity-under-strong-lighting-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/check-clarity-under-strong-lighting-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/check-clarity-under-strong-lighting-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/check-clarity-under-strong-lighting-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/05/check-clarity-under-strong-lighting-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/check-clarity-under-strong-lighting-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Clean Pads To Prevent Micro Marring</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 17 Dec 2025 16:21:55 +0000</pubDate><category>Resin Polishing</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>clear coat</category><category>polishing pads</category><description>Stop swirls and haze.

&lt;p&gt;I’ve watched the same scene a hundred times: you finish a long day of shaping, sanding, and dialing in the gloss. The shop is quiet, the floor swept, your coffee cold. You swing the work light across the panel—maybe it’s a black hood, a river table, or a batch of resin bangles—and your stomach sinks. There it is: a faint gray haze of tiny trails that weren’t visible under the shop lights. That’s micro marring, and nine times out of ten it’s not your machine, polish, or even your technique—it’s what’s happening at the pad face. This is where cleaning while you work becomes the difference between “almost” and “absolutely flawless,” whether you’re finishing paint or doing resin polishing on jewelry and tabletops.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/02.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing/cards/instagram/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing/cards/instagram/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing/cards/instagram/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing/cards/pinterest/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing/cards/pinterest/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing/cards/pinterest/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/17/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/clean-pads-to-prevent-micro-marring-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Avoid Overheating Edges During Polish</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/avoid-overheating-edges-during-polish-resin-polishing/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/avoid-overheating-edges-during-polish-resin-polishing/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 01 Dec 2025 16:10:07 +0000</pubDate><category>Resin Polishing</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>wet sanding</category><description>Engineer-tested methods to keep resin edges cool while polishing.

&lt;p&gt;The first time I overheated a resin edge, it looked perfect—right up until it wasn’t. The surface was glossy, but the perimeter turned milky, then smeared like warm butter under a rotary pad. I could smell the polymer heating. It felt like a setback on a simple task: sanding and finishing a handmade resin coaster. If you’ve been there, you know the mix of frustration and “what did I do wrong?” It’s not lack of care; it’s physics. That edge has less mass to absorb heat, and during resin polishing you’re pushing friction and pressure into a tiny contact patch. Heat has nowhere to go.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/15.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/avoid-overheating-edges-during-polish-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/avoid-overheating-edges-during-polish-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/avoid-overheating-edges-during-polish-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/avoid-overheating-edges-during-polish-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/avoid-overheating-edges-during-polish-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/avoid-overheating-edges-during-polish-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/avoid-overheating-edges-during-polish-resin-polishing/cards/instagram/avoid-overheating-edges-during-polish-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/avoid-overheating-edges-during-polish-resin-polishing/cards/instagram/avoid-overheating-edges-during-polish-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/avoid-overheating-edges-during-polish-resin-polishing/cards/instagram/avoid-overheating-edges-during-polish-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/avoid-overheating-edges-during-polish-resin-polishing/cards/pinterest/avoid-overheating-edges-during-polish-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/avoid-overheating-edges-during-polish-resin-polishing/cards/pinterest/avoid-overheating-edges-during-polish-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/avoid-overheating-edges-during-polish-resin-polishing/cards/pinterest/avoid-overheating-edges-during-polish-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/avoid-overheating-edges-during-polish-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/avoid-overheating-edges-during-polish-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/avoid-overheating-edges-during-polish-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/avoid-overheating-edges-during-polish-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/01/avoid-overheating-edges-during-polish-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/avoid-overheating-edges-during-polish-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Choose Pad And Compound For Plastics</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 13:37:22 +0000</pubDate><category>Resin Polishing</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>grit progression</category><category>sanding block</category><category>polishing pads</category><description>Engineer’s guide to resin polishing: pick the right pad and compound for acrylic, polycarbonate, and epoxy.

&lt;p&gt;On a quiet Saturday, I watched a friend slowly lower a buffing pad onto the cloudy edge of his epoxy river table. The coffee mugs had left fine scuffs; sunlight turned them into halos. He’d already tried an all-purpose metal polish and a “universal” wool pad—both grabbed hard, smeared the surface, and left the epoxy warmer than I liked. He looked at me and asked the question I hear weekly: “Which pad and which compound do I actually use for plastics?” It’s an honest question with costly consequences if you guess wrong. Unlike metal paint systems that tolerate a surprising amount of heat and pressure, plastics and cured resins can haze, smear, or stress-craze from a few seconds of the wrong contact.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/01.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/cards/instagram/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/cards/instagram/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/cards/instagram/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/cards/pinterest/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/cards/pinterest/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/cards/pinterest/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/18/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/choose-pad-and-compound-for-plastics-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>13</readingTime></item><item><title>Remove 1500–2000 Grit Marks On Resin</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 07 Nov 2025 23:56:25 +0000</pubDate><category>Resin Polishing</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-1200</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-2500</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>dust control</category><description>Expert workflows to remove 1500–2000 grit marks on resin and achieve optical clarity with the right abrasives, compounds, and heat control.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="resin-polishing-erasing-15002000-grit-scratches"&gt;Resin Polishing: Erasing 1500–2000 Grit Scratches&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pendant looked flawless on the bench last night—glassy, color suspended in amber, edges softened just so. Then morning light hit it. Under a low-angle window beam, micro-scratches flared across the surface like frost on a windshield. You could feel your shoulders sag. You did the careful wet-sand through 1500 and 2000, kept the strokes even, swirled the slurry away. It should be done. But resin is unforgiving under raking light, and 1500–2000 grit marks hang on, whisper-thin but brutally visible. This is the moment where the craft turns from “sanding” to resin polishing: closing the cut, controlling heat, and stepping the abrasive system with intent until the surface stops being a surface and becomes a reflection.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing/cards/instagram/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing/cards/instagram/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing/cards/instagram/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing/cards/pinterest/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing/cards/pinterest/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing/cards/pinterest/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing/cards/facebook/remove-1500-2000-grit-marks-on-resin-resin-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>9</readingTime></item><item><title>Polish Epoxy Resin To Glass Like Finish</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/polish-epoxy-resin-to-glass-like-finish-resin-polishing/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 21:00:08 +0000</pubDate><category>Resin Polishing</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-1500</category><description>Learn how to polish epoxy resin to a glass-like finish with step-by-step sanding, heat control, compounds, and pro tips for durable clarity.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="resin-polishing-for-a-glass-like-epoxy-finish"&gt;Resin Polishing for a Glass-Like Epoxy Finish&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first time you run a fingertip across an epoxy surface, it’s a little magic trick. The light catches, colors bloom, and you expect the kind of clarity you see on showroom glass. But if you’ve poured, leveled, and cured resin yourself, you also know the moment that follows: under sunlight or a raking lamp, faint haze, scratch patterns, or tiny undulations whisper that the job isn’t quite done.

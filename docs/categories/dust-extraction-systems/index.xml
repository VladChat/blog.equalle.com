&lt;p&gt;On a Saturday morning in the shop, the light comes in as a hazy beam. You flip on the sander, nudge it onto an oak tabletop, and within seconds the air looks like a snow globe gone rogue. Your safety glasses fog, your shirt turns gray, and the shop vac whines like it’s doing something—but the dust still settles on every flat surface you own. I’ve been there. I’ve also watched the other version of this scene: the pad spins, dust disappears, the workpiece stays cool, and the abrasive keeps biting for pass after pass. The difference isn’t magic—it&amp;rsquo;s airflow. Specifically, the way a multi-hole disc and a properly set vacuum system handle air and debris to deliver real dustless sanding without killing your cut rate.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/16.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/multi-hole-discs-improve-airflow-and-cut-dustless-sanding/cards/facebook/multi-hole-discs-improve-airflow-and-cut-dustless-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/multi-hole-discs-improve-airflow-and-cut-dustless-sanding/cards/facebook/multi-hole-discs-improve-airflow-and-cut-dustless-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/multi-hole-discs-improve-airflow-and-cut-dustless-sanding/cards/facebook/multi-hole-discs-improve-airflow-and-cut-dustless-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/multi-hole-discs-improve-airflow-and-cut-dustless-sanding/cards/instagram/multi-hole-discs-improve-airflow-and-cut-dustless-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/multi-hole-discs-improve-airflow-and-cut-dustless-sanding/cards/instagram/multi-hole-discs-improve-airflow-and-cut-dustless-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/multi-hole-discs-improve-airflow-and-cut-dustless-sanding/cards/instagram/multi-hole-discs-improve-airflow-and-cut-dustless-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/multi-hole-discs-improve-airflow-and-cut-dustless-sanding/cards/pinterest/multi-hole-discs-improve-airflow-and-cut-dustless-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/multi-hole-discs-improve-airflow-and-cut-dustless-sanding/cards/pinterest/multi-hole-discs-improve-airflow-and-cut-dustless-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/multi-hole-discs-improve-airflow-and-cut-dustless-sanding/cards/pinterest/multi-hole-discs-improve-airflow-and-cut-dustless-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/multi-hole-discs-improve-airflow-and-cut-dustless-sanding/cards/facebook/multi-hole-discs-improve-airflow-and-cut-dustless-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/multi-hole-discs-improve-airflow-and-cut-dustless-sanding/cards/facebook/multi-hole-discs-improve-airflow-and-cut-dustless-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/15/multi-hole-discs-improve-airflow-and-cut-dustless-sanding/cards/facebook/multi-hole-discs-improve-airflow-and-cut-dustless-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Choose Hose Diameter For Best Suction</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 06 Nov 2025 14:24:00 +0000</pubDate><category>Dust Extraction Systems</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>dry sanding</category><category>orbital sander</category><category>sanding block</category><category>joint compound</category><description>An engineer’s guide to hose diameter for dustless sanding—get the best suction, cleaner air, and faster finishing with data-driven choices.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="dustless-sanding-pick-the-right-hose-diameter"&gt;Dustless Sanding: Pick the Right Hose Diameter&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first time I tried to sand a maple tabletop in my small garage, I didn’t plan for the dust. Within minutes, a visible cloud hovered over my workbench, the air had that chalky taste, and the light from the door turned into a foggy beam. The sander did its job, but the shop felt uninhabitable. Fast-forward to today, and my setup looks completely different: a quiet extractor hums under the bench, a smooth-bore hose clips into a sander with a snug port connection, and the cleanup is mostly emptying a bag. The shift to dustless sanding wasn’t just about comfort—it was about control. Once you understand how hose diameter, hose length, and vacuum performance interact, you can tune a system that captures chips and submicron dust instead of aerosolizing it.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding/cards/facebook/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding/cards/facebook/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding/cards/facebook/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding/cards/instagram/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding/cards/instagram/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding/cards/instagram/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding/cards/pinterest/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding/cards/pinterest/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding/cards/pinterest/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding/cards/facebook/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding/cards/facebook/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding/cards/facebook/choose-hose-diameter-for-best-suction-dustless-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Set Up Hepa Dust Extractors For Sanding</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/set-up-hepa-dust-extractors-for-sanding-dustless-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/set-up-hepa-dust-extractors-for-sanding-dustless-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 05:22:40 +0000</pubDate><category>Dust Extraction Systems</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>dust control</category><description>Learn how to configure HEPA dust extractors for dustless sanding, optimize airflow, and choose abrasives for superior surface prep and cleaner results.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="dustless-sanding-setup-with-hepa-dust-extractors"&gt;Dustless Sanding Setup with HEPA Dust Extractors&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a quiet Saturday morning, you roll your sanding cart to the center of the room. The cabinets are masked, the floor is taped, and the sander’s pad lies face-up like a promise. The house is occupied—kids already drawing at the kitchen table—so emitting a fine fog of particulate is not an option. This is where dustless sanding becomes more than a phrase; it’s a standard of care. Switch on the extractor; it hums to life with a steady pitch, a different sound than a shop vac—lower, tighter, purposeful. The sander’s brush skirt seals to the workpiece, and the paper’s multi-hole pattern lines up with the pad like a gasket. Your first pass is a whisper of rotation and consistent cut. No haze in the light shafts, no grit on your tongue, no need to pause when someone walks by. The job feels clean in a way that’s as much about process control as it is about comfort.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/set-up-hepa-dust-extractors-for-sanding-dustless-sanding/cards/facebook/set-up-hepa-dust-extractors-for-sanding-dustless-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/set-up-hepa-dust-extractors-for-sanding-dustless-sanding/cards/facebook/set-up-hepa-dust-extractors-for-sanding-dustless-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/set-up-hepa-dust-extractors-for-sanding-dustless-sanding/cards/facebook/set-up-hepa-dust-extractors-for-sanding-dustless-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/set-up-hepa-dust-extractors-for-sanding-dustless-sanding/cards/instagram/set-up-hepa-dust-extractors-for-sanding-dustless-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/set-up-hepa-dust-extractors-for-sanding-dustless-sanding/cards/instagram/set-up-hepa-dust-extractors-for-sanding-dustless-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/set-up-hepa-dust-extractors-for-sanding-dustless-sanding/cards/instagram/set-up-hepa-dust-extractors-for-sanding-dustless-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/set-up-hepa-dust-extractors-for-sanding-dustless-sanding/cards/pinterest/set-up-hepa-dust-extractors-for-sanding-dustless-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/set-up-hepa-dust-extractors-for-sanding-dustless-sanding/cards/pinterest/set-up-hepa-dust-extractors-for-sanding-dustless-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/set-up-hepa-dust-extractors-for-sanding-dustless-sanding/cards/pinterest/set-up-hepa-dust-extractors-for-sanding-dustless-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/set-up-hepa-dust-extractors-for-sanding-dustless-sanding/cards/facebook/set-up-hepa-dust-extractors-for-sanding-dustless-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/set-up-hepa-dust-extractors-for-sanding-dustless-sanding/cards/facebook/set-up-hepa-dust-extractors-for-sanding-dustless-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/set-up-hepa-dust-extractors-for-sanding-dustless-sanding/cards/facebook/set-up-hepa-dust-extractors-for-sanding-dustless-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item></channel></rss>

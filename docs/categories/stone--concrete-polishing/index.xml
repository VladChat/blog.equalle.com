&lt;p&gt;The first time you see them, it’s usually under that uncompromising halo of afternoon light: tiny pinpricks that interrupt what should be one continuous reflection across the slab. You step closer and feel the break in continuity with your eye before your hand even reaches the surface. The project is on track—aggregate exposure is even, joints are clean, dust collection has been dialed in—but these microvoids threaten the final read of the floor. In concrete polishing, pinholes are not cosmetic trivia; they are the difference between a floor that simply shines and a floor that looks poured from liquid glass.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/27.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/14/repair-pinholes-before-final-passes-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/repair-pinholes-before-final-passes-concrete-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/14/repair-pinholes-before-final-passes-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/repair-pinholes-before-final-passes-concrete-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/14/repair-pinholes-before-final-passes-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/repair-pinholes-before-final-passes-concrete-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/14/repair-pinholes-before-final-passes-concrete-polishing/cards/instagram/repair-pinholes-before-final-passes-concrete-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/14/repair-pinholes-before-final-passes-concrete-polishing/cards/instagram/repair-pinholes-before-final-passes-concrete-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/14/repair-pinholes-before-final-passes-concrete-polishing/cards/instagram/repair-pinholes-before-final-passes-concrete-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/14/repair-pinholes-before-final-passes-concrete-polishing/cards/pinterest/repair-pinholes-before-final-passes-concrete-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/14/repair-pinholes-before-final-passes-concrete-polishing/cards/pinterest/repair-pinholes-before-final-passes-concrete-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/14/repair-pinholes-before-final-passes-concrete-polishing/cards/pinterest/repair-pinholes-before-final-passes-concrete-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/14/repair-pinholes-before-final-passes-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/repair-pinholes-before-final-passes-concrete-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/14/repair-pinholes-before-final-passes-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/repair-pinholes-before-final-passes-concrete-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/14/repair-pinholes-before-final-passes-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/repair-pinholes-before-final-passes-concrete-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>9</readingTime></item><item><title>Sealer Selection After Polishing</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/28/sealer-selection-after-polishing-concrete-polishing/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/28/sealer-selection-after-polishing-concrete-polishing/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 13:54:10 +0000</pubDate><category>Stone &amp; Concrete Polishing</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-3000</category><description>Learn how to choose the right sealer after concrete polishing, from penetrating to film-forming options, with tips for application and maintenance.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="sealer-selection-after-concrete-polishing-a-guide"&gt;Sealer Selection After Concrete Polishing: A Guide&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You step into a sunlit space—your kitchen remodel or a new café—and the first thing that catches your eye is the floor. It’s a clean plane of light and shadow, a surface that quietly reflects the room’s shape back to you. The crew finished concrete polishing only yesterday, and the transformation is striking: aggregate subtly peeks through, edges are crisp, and the overall sheen makes the room feel bigger, cooler, more intentional. You run a hand across the surface. It’s smooth, but not slippery. It feels durable—permanent, even.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/11.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/28/sealer-selection-after-polishing-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/sealer-selection-after-polishing-concrete-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/28/sealer-selection-after-polishing-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/sealer-selection-after-polishing-concrete-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/28/sealer-selection-after-polishing-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/sealer-selection-after-polishing-concrete-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/28/sealer-selection-after-polishing-concrete-polishing/cards/instagram/sealer-selection-after-polishing-concrete-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/28/sealer-selection-after-polishing-concrete-polishing/cards/instagram/sealer-selection-after-polishing-concrete-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/28/sealer-selection-after-polishing-concrete-polishing/cards/instagram/sealer-selection-after-polishing-concrete-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/28/sealer-selection-after-polishing-concrete-polishing/cards/pinterest/sealer-selection-after-polishing-concrete-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/28/sealer-selection-after-polishing-concrete-polishing/cards/pinterest/sealer-selection-after-polishing-concrete-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/28/sealer-selection-after-polishing-concrete-polishing/cards/pinterest/sealer-selection-after-polishing-concrete-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/28/sealer-selection-after-polishing-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/sealer-selection-after-polishing-concrete-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/28/sealer-selection-after-polishing-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/sealer-selection-after-polishing-concrete-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/28/sealer-selection-after-polishing-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/sealer-selection-after-polishing-concrete-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Check Flatness Before Higher Grits</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/07/check-flatness-before-higher-grits-concrete-polishing/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/07/check-flatness-before-higher-grits-concrete-polishing/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 13:45:51 +0000</pubDate><category>Stone &amp; Concrete Polishing</category><category>grit-200</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit progression</category><category>mirror finish</category><description>Master concrete polishing with pro steps to verify flatness before climbing grits.

&lt;p&gt;The first time I chased a mirror finish on a tired garage slab, I thought more passes and higher grits would solve everything. The grinder hummed, the vacuum roared, and the floor looked decent—until late afternoon sun spilled across it and exposed a field of faint troughs and ghost scratches. You know that sinking feeling: you’ve already climbed to 400 grit and realize the slab isn’t flat enough to carry a true reflection. That’s the money-losing moment in concrete polishing—when you’re forced to drop back down, rework the metal steps, and eat the day.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/24.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/07/check-flatness-before-higher-grits-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/check-flatness-before-higher-grits-concrete-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/07/check-flatness-before-higher-grits-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/check-flatness-before-higher-grits-concrete-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/07/check-flatness-before-higher-grits-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/check-flatness-before-higher-grits-concrete-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/07/check-flatness-before-higher-grits-concrete-polishing/cards/instagram/check-flatness-before-higher-grits-concrete-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/07/check-flatness-before-higher-grits-concrete-polishing/cards/instagram/check-flatness-before-higher-grits-concrete-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/07/check-flatness-before-higher-grits-concrete-polishing/cards/instagram/check-flatness-before-higher-grits-concrete-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/07/check-flatness-before-higher-grits-concrete-polishing/cards/pinterest/check-flatness-before-higher-grits-concrete-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/07/check-flatness-before-higher-grits-concrete-polishing/cards/pinterest/check-flatness-before-higher-grits-concrete-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/07/check-flatness-before-higher-grits-concrete-polishing/cards/pinterest/check-flatness-before-higher-grits-concrete-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/07/check-flatness-before-higher-grits-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/check-flatness-before-higher-grits-concrete-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/07/check-flatness-before-higher-grits-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/check-flatness-before-higher-grits-concrete-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/07/check-flatness-before-higher-grits-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/check-flatness-before-higher-grits-concrete-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Edge Tool Blending With Main Field</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-tool-blending-with-main-field-concrete-polishing/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-tool-blending-with-main-field-concrete-polishing/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 15:29:17 +0000</pubDate><category>Stone &amp; Concrete Polishing</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Engineer-tested methods to blend edges with the main field in concrete polishing.

&lt;p&gt;You notice it first at the baseboards. Morning light lands across a kitchen floor that otherwise looks like poured glass, and the edges flash a dull, scratchy halo. In a boutique retail space, the center field mirrors the fixtures, but at the columns and along the walls, the reflection breaks—hazy, slightly orange-peeled, almost like it came from a different contractor. As a product engineer who reviews abrasives and machines for a living, I see this edge-to-field mismatch often, even on projects that nailed aggregate exposure and gloss in the main run. It’s not because teams don’t care; it’s because edge blending is where real-world constraints collide with the material science of concrete polishing: smaller tools, different pressure and speed, heat, slurry load, and changing paste content near walls.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/08.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-tool-blending-with-main-field-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/edge-tool-blending-with-main-field-concrete-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-tool-blending-with-main-field-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/edge-tool-blending-with-main-field-concrete-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-tool-blending-with-main-field-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/edge-tool-blending-with-main-field-concrete-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-tool-blending-with-main-field-concrete-polishing/cards/instagram/edge-tool-blending-with-main-field-concrete-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-tool-blending-with-main-field-concrete-polishing/cards/instagram/edge-tool-blending-with-main-field-concrete-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-tool-blending-with-main-field-concrete-polishing/cards/instagram/edge-tool-blending-with-main-field-concrete-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-tool-blending-with-main-field-concrete-polishing/cards/pinterest/edge-tool-blending-with-main-field-concrete-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-tool-blending-with-main-field-concrete-polishing/cards/pinterest/edge-tool-blending-with-main-field-concrete-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-tool-blending-with-main-field-concrete-polishing/cards/pinterest/edge-tool-blending-with-main-field-concrete-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-tool-blending-with-main-field-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/edge-tool-blending-with-main-field-concrete-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-tool-blending-with-main-field-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/edge-tool-blending-with-main-field-concrete-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/19/edge-tool-blending-with-main-field-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/edge-tool-blending-with-main-field-concrete-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Slurry Management During Wet Grinding</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/03/slurry-management-during-wet-grinding-concrete-polishing/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/03/slurry-management-during-wet-grinding-concrete-polishing/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 03 Dec 2025 13:41:04 +0000</pubDate><category>Stone &amp; Concrete Polishing</category><category>grit-40</category><category>grit-70</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Learn expert slurry management for wet grinding and concrete polishing—chemistry, tooling, workflow, and compliance to deliver consistent, high-gloss floors.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="wet-grinding-slurry-control-for-concrete-polishing"&gt;Wet Grinding Slurry Control for Concrete Polishing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s 6:10 a.m. in a silent warehouse. Air is cool, lights are still buzzing to full brightness, and the crew is rolling out hoses and laying edge-protection mats with the practiced choreography of a hundred previous jobs. The general contractor walks the space with a client, tracing imagined traffic patterns in the air: this will be a public lobby, high reflectivity, no coating, a breathable sheen that wears in gracefully, not off in flakes. On-site expectations like these live or die by process discipline. Everyone agrees on the end state—clean clarity, sharp aggregate reveal—but the real determinant of that result begins long before the burnish. It starts with water, abrasives, and the wet byproduct the team will generate hour after hour. It starts with slurry.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/21.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/03/slurry-management-during-wet-grinding-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/slurry-management-during-wet-grinding-concrete-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/03/slurry-management-during-wet-grinding-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/slurry-management-during-wet-grinding-concrete-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/03/slurry-management-during-wet-grinding-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/slurry-management-during-wet-grinding-concrete-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/03/slurry-management-during-wet-grinding-concrete-polishing/cards/instagram/slurry-management-during-wet-grinding-concrete-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/03/slurry-management-during-wet-grinding-concrete-polishing/cards/instagram/slurry-management-during-wet-grinding-concrete-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/03/slurry-management-during-wet-grinding-concrete-polishing/cards/instagram/slurry-management-during-wet-grinding-concrete-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/03/slurry-management-during-wet-grinding-concrete-polishing/cards/pinterest/slurry-management-during-wet-grinding-concrete-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/03/slurry-management-during-wet-grinding-concrete-polishing/cards/pinterest/slurry-management-during-wet-grinding-concrete-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/03/slurry-management-during-wet-grinding-concrete-polishing/cards/pinterest/slurry-management-during-wet-grinding-concrete-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/03/slurry-management-during-wet-grinding-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/slurry-management-during-wet-grinding-concrete-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/03/slurry-management-during-wet-grinding-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/slurry-management-during-wet-grinding-concrete-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/03/slurry-management-during-wet-grinding-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/slurry-management-during-wet-grinding-concrete-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Densifier Timing For Stronger Surface</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/densifier-timing-for-stronger-surface-concrete-polishing/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/densifier-timing-for-stronger-surface-concrete-polishing/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2025 15:46:00 +0000</pubDate><category>Stone &amp; Concrete Polishing</category><category>grit-40</category><category>grit-50</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-1000</category><description>Master densifier timing in concrete polishing to unlock higher hardness, gloss, and abrasion resistance with reliable, step-by-step workflow guidance.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="densifier-timing-for-stronger-concrete-polishing"&gt;Densifier Timing for Stronger Concrete Polishing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first time you walk across a newly polished shop floor, the sound underfoot tells you nearly everything: tight, crystalline, with no chalky whisper at your heel. A good concrete polish isn’t only about sheen; it’s the tactile confirmation that the surface has been chemically tightened and mechanically refined in harmony. Yet that harmony is fragile. If you’ve ever watched slurry smear instead of cutting, or seen a gloss peak early and then plateau—no matter how many passes—you’ve felt how unforgiving poor timing can be. The densifier you choose, and more importantly when you put it down, can either lock in a fine scratch pattern and raise surface hardness or entomb flaws and waste abrasive life.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/07.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/densifier-timing-for-stronger-surface-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/densifier-timing-for-stronger-surface-concrete-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/densifier-timing-for-stronger-surface-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/densifier-timing-for-stronger-surface-concrete-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/densifier-timing-for-stronger-surface-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/densifier-timing-for-stronger-surface-concrete-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/densifier-timing-for-stronger-surface-concrete-polishing/cards/instagram/densifier-timing-for-stronger-surface-concrete-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/densifier-timing-for-stronger-surface-concrete-polishing/cards/instagram/densifier-timing-for-stronger-surface-concrete-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/densifier-timing-for-stronger-surface-concrete-polishing/cards/instagram/densifier-timing-for-stronger-surface-concrete-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/densifier-timing-for-stronger-surface-concrete-polishing/cards/pinterest/densifier-timing-for-stronger-surface-concrete-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/densifier-timing-for-stronger-surface-concrete-polishing/cards/pinterest/densifier-timing-for-stronger-surface-concrete-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/densifier-timing-for-stronger-surface-concrete-polishing/cards/pinterest/densifier-timing-for-stronger-surface-concrete-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/densifier-timing-for-stronger-surface-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/densifier-timing-for-stronger-surface-concrete-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/densifier-timing-for-stronger-surface-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/densifier-timing-for-stronger-surface-concrete-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/19/densifier-timing-for-stronger-surface-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/densifier-timing-for-stronger-surface-concrete-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Grit Steps For Honing And Polishing</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/grit-steps-for-honing-and-polishing-concrete-polishing/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/grit-steps-for-honing-and-polishing-concrete-polishing/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 08 Nov 2025 01:11:57 +0000</pubDate><category>Stone &amp; Concrete Polishing</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>dust control</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Learn the exact grit sequences for honing and concrete polishing, from metal-bond cuts to high-gloss finishes, with practical tips and pro-level clarity.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="grit-steps-that-unlock-beautiful-concrete-polishing"&gt;Grit Steps That Unlock Beautiful Concrete Polishing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The café opens just before sunrise, the first light catching on cups and chrome as someone flips the sign to “Open.” Footsteps echo across the floor—once dull, scuffed, and interrupted by patchy coatings. A few weeks ago, the owner debated a full remodel. Instead, she chose a different path: refining what was already there. With a plan centered on careful grit steps, the team ground, honed, and finally achieved a reflective finish through concrete polishing. Now the floor turns light into soft ribbons. It feels new without losing its character; the aggregate tells a story, the surface is smooth, and maintenance is suddenly predictable. People pause when they walk in. They notice the room before they notice the menu.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/grit-steps-for-honing-and-polishing-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/grit-steps-for-honing-and-polishing-concrete-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/grit-steps-for-honing-and-polishing-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/grit-steps-for-honing-and-polishing-concrete-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/grit-steps-for-honing-and-polishing-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/grit-steps-for-honing-and-polishing-concrete-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/grit-steps-for-honing-and-polishing-concrete-polishing/cards/instagram/grit-steps-for-honing-and-polishing-concrete-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/grit-steps-for-honing-and-polishing-concrete-polishing/cards/instagram/grit-steps-for-honing-and-polishing-concrete-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/grit-steps-for-honing-and-polishing-concrete-polishing/cards/instagram/grit-steps-for-honing-and-polishing-concrete-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/grit-steps-for-honing-and-polishing-concrete-polishing/cards/pinterest/grit-steps-for-honing-and-polishing-concrete-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/grit-steps-for-honing-and-polishing-concrete-polishing/cards/pinterest/grit-steps-for-honing-and-polishing-concrete-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/grit-steps-for-honing-and-polishing-concrete-polishing/cards/pinterest/grit-steps-for-honing-and-polishing-concrete-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/grit-steps-for-honing-and-polishing-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/grit-steps-for-honing-and-polishing-concrete-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/grit-steps-for-honing-and-polishing-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/grit-steps-for-honing-and-polishing-concrete-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/08/grit-steps-for-honing-and-polishing-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/grit-steps-for-honing-and-polishing-concrete-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Progress From Metal Bond To Resin Pads</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/progress-from-metal-bond-to-resin-pads-concrete-polishing/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/progress-from-metal-bond-to-resin-pads-concrete-polishing/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 04 Nov 2025 01:54:08 +0000</pubDate><category>Stone &amp; Concrete Polishing</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Learn how to progress from metal bond to resin pads in concrete polishing with clear grit sequences, on-site tips, and pro workflows that deliver mirror</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="concrete-polishing-metal-to-resin-pad-mastery"&gt;Concrete Polishing: Metal to Resin Pad Mastery&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a moment in every shop or garage when the floor starts to tell your story. Early morning light spills under the door; you flick on the grinder, and the air lifts just a little with the smell of damp concrete and sawdust from yesterday’s build. You set your coffee down, lace up, and eye the slab—dusty in patches, shiny where years of foot traffic have burnished a path to your bench. This is where concrete polishing earns its keep. It’s not just about gloss. It’s about turning a stained, work-weary surface into a durable, cleanable plane that makes every task feel smoother. And like any good build, the finish depends on the foundation: the right tools, the right sequence, and the discipline to switch from metal to resin at the exact right moment.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/progress-from-metal-bond-to-resin-pads-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/progress-from-metal-bond-to-resin-pads-concrete-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/progress-from-metal-bond-to-resin-pads-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/progress-from-metal-bond-to-resin-pads-concrete-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/progress-from-metal-bond-to-resin-pads-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/progress-from-metal-bond-to-resin-pads-concrete-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/progress-from-metal-bond-to-resin-pads-concrete-polishing/cards/instagram/progress-from-metal-bond-to-resin-pads-concrete-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/progress-from-metal-bond-to-resin-pads-concrete-polishing/cards/instagram/progress-from-metal-bond-to-resin-pads-concrete-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/progress-from-metal-bond-to-resin-pads-concrete-polishing/cards/instagram/progress-from-metal-bond-to-resin-pads-concrete-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/progress-from-metal-bond-to-resin-pads-concrete-polishing/cards/pinterest/progress-from-metal-bond-to-resin-pads-concrete-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/progress-from-metal-bond-to-resin-pads-concrete-polishing/cards/pinterest/progress-from-metal-bond-to-resin-pads-concrete-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/progress-from-metal-bond-to-resin-pads-concrete-polishing/cards/pinterest/progress-from-metal-bond-to-resin-pads-concrete-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/progress-from-metal-bond-to-resin-pads-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/progress-from-metal-bond-to-resin-pads-concrete-polishing.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/progress-from-metal-bond-to-resin-pads-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/progress-from-metal-bond-to-resin-pads-concrete-polishing.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/04/progress-from-metal-bond-to-resin-pads-concrete-polishing/cards/facebook/progress-from-metal-bond-to-resin-pads-concrete-polishing.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>15</readingTime></item></channel></rss>

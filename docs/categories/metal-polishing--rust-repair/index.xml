&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning light caught the fender of my old wagon just right, the way it sometimes does when you’re not quite awake and not quite rushing. A faint blister under the paint telegraphed something I’ve learned to notice: the subtle topography of oxidation. It’s the kind of moment most of us meet with a sigh and a glance away. I paused instead. As a product engineer who’s spent years testing abrasives, primers, and coatings, I’ve learned that the difference between a quick cosmetic tune-up and a structural failure starts with how we look at rust—and how early we decide to act on it. Whether you wrench on weekends or you’re planning a professional rust repair, the first step is classification. Is it only surface rust that can be abraded clean? Is it scale that has undermined the steel layers? Or is it perforation where oxygen and time have already won a hole through the sheet?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Grit Progression For Aluminum Before Buffing</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/02/grit-progression-for-aluminum-before-buffing-metal-polishing/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/02/grit-progression-for-aluminum-before-buffing-metal-polishing/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 02 Nov 2025 23:37:34 +0000</pubDate><category>Metal Polishing &amp; Rust Repair</category><category>metal polishing</category><category>grit progression</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>clear coat</category><category>sanding block</category><description>Learn grit progression for aluminum and master metal polishing.

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine standing in your workshop, the soft hum of machinery around you, the air filled with the scent of fresh metal shavings. It&amp;rsquo;s a place of creation, where raw materials are transformed into shining, polished works of art. You&amp;rsquo;re holding a piece of aluminum, rough to the touch, yet full of potential. With the right techniques, this unassuming piece can become a mirror-like masterpiece. The secret lies in grit progression—a meticulous, step-by-step process that transforms the mundane into the magnificent.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><readingTime>6</readingTime></item></channel></rss>

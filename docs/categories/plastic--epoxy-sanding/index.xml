&lt;p&gt;The first pass tells the whole story. You stand over a curing project—maybe a kayak hull, a countertop, or a floor section—with yesterday’s resin gone glassy and a few unkind ridges catching the raking light. Your hand slides across the surface and pauses on a drip, a seam, a ripple that won’t disappear by wishful thinking. You can hear the random orbital sander on the bench before you touch it. The only decision that matters now: what grit to start with. Get it wrong and you burn time, discs, and patience. Get it right and the surface flatness comes quickly, scratches stack predictably, and the finish you planned is still in reach. I’ve spent years chasing that first cut—especially during epoxy sanding—because the first cut sets your entire workflow’s cost, heat load, and scratch management.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/28.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/17/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/17/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/17/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/17/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding/cards/instagram/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/17/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding/cards/instagram/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/17/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding/cards/instagram/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/17/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding/cards/pinterest/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/17/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding/cards/pinterest/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/17/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding/cards/pinterest/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/17/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/17/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/17/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/start-grit-for-leveling-high-spots-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Let Epoxy Cure Fully Before Sanding</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 07 Nov 2025 16:25:05 +0000</pubDate><category>Plastic &amp; Epoxy Sanding</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-360</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit progression</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>Learn why letting epoxy fully cure before sanding is essential, plus timelines, tests, grit progressions, and pro tips for flawless, clear finishes.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="epoxy-sanding-why-waiting-to-cure-pays-off"&gt;Epoxy Sanding: Why Waiting to Cure Pays Off&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a point in every resin project when anticipation and restraint collide. You’ve de‑molded a river board you poured last weekend or set down a glossy flood coat on a tabletop, and the surface is whispering promises of glass-like clarity. You picture the final reveal: the light catching the grain, the resin depth turning everyday moments into a small ceremony. You also see the last mile between what is and what could be—the smoothing, refining, and polishing phase—also known as epoxy sanding. Your hands ache to pick up the sander. But this is where patience protects your craftsmanship.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding/cards/instagram/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding/cards/instagram/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding/cards/instagram/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding/cards/pinterest/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding/cards/pinterest/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding/cards/pinterest/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/07/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/let-epoxy-cure-fully-before-sanding-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Avoid Loading With Stearated Papers</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 20:47:55 +0000</pubDate><category>Plastic &amp; Epoxy Sanding</category><category>grit-280</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>wet sanding</category><category>dust control</category><category>grit progression</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>Master epoxy sanding without clogging.

&lt;p&gt;You know the moment: the shop is quiet, the resin river table catches morning light, and all you can see are tiny ridges, dust nibs, and a faint orange peel across that once-glassy pour. This is where projects are made—or marred. Epoxy sanding isn’t glamorous, but it’s the step that decides if your final finish looks like a mirror or a fogged window. And if you’ve ever had sandpaper load up in seconds, smear epoxy into gummy streaks, or clog your discs so fast you start doubting your gear, you’re not alone. I’ve been there—hands on the sander, vac humming, wondering why the surface keeps fighting back.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding/cards/instagram/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding/cards/instagram/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding/cards/instagram/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding/cards/pinterest/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding/cards/pinterest/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding/cards/pinterest/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding/cards/facebook/avoid-loading-with-stearated-papers-epoxy-sanding.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item></channel></rss>

&lt;p&gt;On a quiet Saturday morning, you tape off the trim, load your polisher, and stare at the paint under bright LEDs. Swirls dance across the clear coat, with a few deeper scratches that refuse to disappear. You’ve got compounds lined up, pads sorted into neatly labeled bins, and sheets of polishing sandpaper ready if the defects demand leveling. Yet the question lingers: which pad material will get you there fastest, without overheating, over-thinning the clear, or leaving haze to chase?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/27.webp" medium="image"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Remove 2000 Grit Sanding Scratches Efficiently</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/remove-2000-grit-sanding-scratches-efficiently-polishing-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/remove-2000-grit-sanding-scratches-efficiently-polishing-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 05 Nov 2025 05:18:58 +0000</pubDate><category>Polishing &amp; Finishing</category><category>mirror finish</category><category>polishing pads</category><category>grit progression</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>wet sanding</category><description>Learn how to remove 2000-grit sanding scratches fast with precise workflows, polishing sandpaper selection, and pro-level compounding techniques.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="polishing-sandpaper-erasing-2000-grit-scratches"&gt;Polishing Sandpaper: Erasing 2000-Grit Scratches&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a quiet Saturday morning, the garage feels like a studio. The door is up, the sun is low, and the panel you’ve just leveled with 2000-grit wet sanding is a uniform gray haze—deliberate, dense, and a little intimidating. At arm’s length the surface looks flat, but under a raking LED it blooms with tight linear tracks, the signature of controlled abrasion. This is the moment when confidence wavers: did you go too far, or not far enough? If you’ve ever paused and wondered how to erase that texture efficiently—without reintroducing waves, burning edges, or chasing your tail—this guide is for you.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Difference Between Compounding And Polishing</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/difference-between-compounding-and-polishing-polishing-sandpaper/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 02:16:29 +0000</pubDate><category>Polishing &amp; Finishing</category><category>mirror finish</category><category>polishing pads</category><category>grit progression</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1000</category><category>grit-1200</category><category>grit-1500</category><category>grit-2000</category><category>grit-3000</category><category>clear coat</category><description>Learn the difference between compounding and polishing, how to choose polishing sandpaper and pads, and the step-by-step process for flawless finishes.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="compounding-vs-polishing-guide-to-polishing-sandpaper"&gt;Compounding vs Polishing: Guide to Polishing Sandpaper&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a moment every craftsperson recognizes: you step into the garage or studio, sunlight cuts across a painted panel or tabletop, and you see everything—swirls you never meant to leave, scratches that catch the light just so, a haze that dulls the color you spent hours applying. Your instinct might be to reach for the strongest product you own, but knowing the difference between compounding and polishing—and where polishing sandpaper fits—can save time, material, and the finish you’re trying to protect. Maybe it’s the clear coat on your daily driver, the lacquer on a guitar body, or the resin on a turned pen blank. Different surfaces, same goal: remove defects while preserving as much material as possible.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><readingTime>11</readingTime></item></channel></rss>

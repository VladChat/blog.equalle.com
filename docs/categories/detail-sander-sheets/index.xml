&lt;p&gt;The first time I rescued an old maple dresser, the corners told the story: paint packed like frosting into the seams, varnish hardened in the fillets, and decades of nicks rounding over what were once crisp lines. A random orbital couldn’t reach. A hand block took forever. But a small triangular pad on a mouse sander, paired with the right detail sander sheets, slipped into the geometry like it was designed for the job—because it was. That’s the magic. Tight corners stop being dead ends and start becoming checkpoints you can actually conquer.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Best Grit Sheets For Detail Sanding Tools</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/best-grit-sheets-for-detail-sanding-tools-detail-sander-sheets/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/best-grit-sheets-for-detail-sanding-tools-detail-sander-sheets/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 02:40:19 +0000</pubDate><category>Detail Sander Sheets</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>paint prep</category><description>Engineer-tested guide to detail sander sheets: grit selection, backings, dust control, and brand picks for wood, paint, and plastics.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="best-grit-detail-sander-sheets-an-engineers-guide"&gt;Best Grit Detail Sander Sheets: An Engineer’s Guide&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a moment in every restoration project when the big tools step aside and the small corners decide the result. I hit that moment last winter, hunched over a mid-century nightstand with tapered legs and a drawer pull recess shaped like a teardrop. My random orbit sander took care of the top in minutes, but the tight inside curves and the sharp transitions around the pull were a different story. I swapped to a detail sander and discovered what many DIYers learn the hard way: the tool is only as precise as the sheet you mount on it. The right detail sander sheets determine whether you get crisp edges and a uniform scratch or burnished tips and clogged grit.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><readingTime>13</readingTime></item></channel></rss>

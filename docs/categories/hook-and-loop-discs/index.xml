&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning in the shop: coffee on the bench, a fresh board clamped up, and the familiar hum of the random orbit sander. You press a new disc onto the pad, pull the trigger, and start your first pass—only to feel the disk skate and skip. You lift the sander and find a fuzz of dust caked onto the hooks, a few bent over, and that telltale glossy sheen that means friction has had its way with the pad. The job slows, the finish suffers, and those hook and loop sanding discs seem to be losing their grip long before the abrasive is worn out.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/10.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/clean-hook-and-loop-pads-to-extend-life-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/clean-hook-and-loop-pads-to-extend-life-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/clean-hook-and-loop-pads-to-extend-life-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/clean-hook-and-loop-pads-to-extend-life-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/clean-hook-and-loop-pads-to-extend-life-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/clean-hook-and-loop-pads-to-extend-life-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/clean-hook-and-loop-pads-to-extend-life-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/clean-hook-and-loop-pads-to-extend-life-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/clean-hook-and-loop-pads-to-extend-life-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/clean-hook-and-loop-pads-to-extend-life-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/clean-hook-and-loop-pads-to-extend-life-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/clean-hook-and-loop-pads-to-extend-life-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/clean-hook-and-loop-pads-to-extend-life-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/clean-hook-and-loop-pads-to-extend-life-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/clean-hook-and-loop-pads-to-extend-life-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/clean-hook-and-loop-pads-to-extend-life-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/clean-hook-and-loop-pads-to-extend-life-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/clean-hook-and-loop-pads-to-extend-life-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/clean-hook-and-loop-pads-to-extend-life-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/clean-hook-and-loop-pads-to-extend-life-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/clean-hook-and-loop-pads-to-extend-life-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/clean-hook-and-loop-pads-to-extend-life-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/clean-hook-and-loop-pads-to-extend-life-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/clean-hook-and-loop-pads-to-extend-life-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Multi Hole Pattern Discs For Dust Extraction</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/multi-hole-pattern-discs-for-dust-extraction-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/multi-hole-pattern-discs-for-dust-extraction-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 05 Nov 2025 19:36:13 +0000</pubDate><category>Hook-and-Loop Discs</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-180</category><category>dust control</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Master dust extraction with multi-hole pattern, hook and loop sanding discs.

&lt;p&gt;When the shop is quiet and the first coffee is still hot, that’s when a sanding session sets the tone for the whole day. I flip on the extractor, click a disc onto the sander, and before I even touch wood, I think about dust. Not because I’m fussy, but because I’ve lived both realities: a haze of airborne grit that coats your lungs and leaves pinholes in your finish, and the sweet relief of clean air and crisp surfaces. The difference often comes down to using the right gear—specifically, multi-hole pattern discs designed for dust extraction, paired with hook and loop sanding discs that swap fast and stay flat.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/multi-hole-pattern-discs-for-dust-extraction-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/multi-hole-pattern-discs-for-dust-extraction-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/multi-hole-pattern-discs-for-dust-extraction-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/multi-hole-pattern-discs-for-dust-extraction-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/multi-hole-pattern-discs-for-dust-extraction-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/multi-hole-pattern-discs-for-dust-extraction-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/multi-hole-pattern-discs-for-dust-extraction-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/multi-hole-pattern-discs-for-dust-extraction-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/multi-hole-pattern-discs-for-dust-extraction-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/multi-hole-pattern-discs-for-dust-extraction-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/multi-hole-pattern-discs-for-dust-extraction-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/multi-hole-pattern-discs-for-dust-extraction-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/multi-hole-pattern-discs-for-dust-extraction-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/multi-hole-pattern-discs-for-dust-extraction-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/multi-hole-pattern-discs-for-dust-extraction-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/multi-hole-pattern-discs-for-dust-extraction-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/multi-hole-pattern-discs-for-dust-extraction-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/multi-hole-pattern-discs-for-dust-extraction-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/multi-hole-pattern-discs-for-dust-extraction-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/multi-hole-pattern-discs-for-dust-extraction-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/multi-hole-pattern-discs-for-dust-extraction-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/multi-hole-pattern-discs-for-dust-extraction-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/multi-hole-pattern-discs-for-dust-extraction-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/multi-hole-pattern-discs-for-dust-extraction-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Velcro Disc Attachment For Orbital Sanders</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 04:51:13 +0000</pubDate><category>Hook-and-Loop Discs</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>orbital sander</category><description>Engineer-tested guide to hook and loop sanding discs, from pad heat and disc selection to failure modes, setup tips, and performance tests.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="hook-and-loop-sanding-discs-for-orbital-sanders"&gt;Hook and Loop Sanding Discs for Orbital Sanders&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Saturday morning in the shop starts with optimism—the kind that comes with fresh coffee, a new sheet of maple, and the subtle hum of a random orbital sander spooling up. Ten minutes later, optimism hits the floor with the sanding disc. If you’ve been there, you know the feeling: the Velcro-style backing is glazed, the pad hooks are shiny and rounded over, and every new disc lasts a little shorter than the last. The culprit isn’t just cheap consumables; more often it’s heat, pressure, and a mismatch between tool, pad, and abrasive. This is where hook and loop sanding discs earn both their reputation for convenience and the blame when the system isn’t set up correctly.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>15</readingTime></item></channel></rss>

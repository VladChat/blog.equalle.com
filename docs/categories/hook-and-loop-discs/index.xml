&lt;p&gt;The morning the storm rolled through, I reached for a sleeve of hook and loop sanding discs that had sat overnight on the bench. The disc stack had a faint wave to it—just enough curl to feel wrong when I pinched the edges. A minute into the first pass on white oak, the orbit pattern started to chatter. The grit looked fine, but the face felt warmer than it should, and the pad sounded different—thinner, harsher. When I peeled the disc, the loops carried a trace of condensate and dust paste. Five more minutes and the edge was lifting under lateral load. The disc flew off.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/17.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/26/disc-storage-and-humidity-care-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/disc-storage-and-humidity-care-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/26/disc-storage-and-humidity-care-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/disc-storage-and-humidity-care-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/26/disc-storage-and-humidity-care-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/disc-storage-and-humidity-care-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/26/disc-storage-and-humidity-care-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/disc-storage-and-humidity-care-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/26/disc-storage-and-humidity-care-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/disc-storage-and-humidity-care-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/26/disc-storage-and-humidity-care-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/disc-storage-and-humidity-care-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/26/disc-storage-and-humidity-care-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/disc-storage-and-humidity-care-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/26/disc-storage-and-humidity-care-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/disc-storage-and-humidity-care-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/26/disc-storage-and-humidity-care-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/disc-storage-and-humidity-care-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/26/disc-storage-and-humidity-care-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/disc-storage-and-humidity-care-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/26/disc-storage-and-humidity-care-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/disc-storage-and-humidity-care-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/26/disc-storage-and-humidity-care-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/disc-storage-and-humidity-care-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Replace Discs Safely During Operation</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/09/replace-discs-safely-during-operation-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/09/replace-discs-safely-during-operation-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 14:22:02 +0000</pubDate><category>Hook-and-Loop Discs</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit progression</category><category>orbital sander</category><category>dust control</category><description>Learn how to change hook and loop sanding discs safely mid-project—avoid slips, protect your pad, and get cleaner, faster results with every grit.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="safe-swaps-for-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs"&gt;Safe Swaps for Hook and Loop Sanding Discs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hum of the sander is oddly soothing until the disc starts to chatter and the finish turns patchy. You ease off the pressure, glance at the clock, and weigh a familiar trade-off: keep pushing a dull disc or risk a clumsy change that costs both time and surface quality. Maybe you’re refinishing a mid-century dresser you promised your sister, or you’re on the third room of a floor restoration where the deadline has more backbone than the old oak. Either way, the moments you swap abrasives can make or break a project. This is where hook and loop sanding discs quietly earn their keep—quick changes, consistent grip, and fewer interruptions when the job is in full swing.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/01.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/09/replace-discs-safely-during-operation-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/replace-discs-safely-during-operation-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/09/replace-discs-safely-during-operation-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/replace-discs-safely-during-operation-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/09/replace-discs-safely-during-operation-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/replace-discs-safely-during-operation-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/09/replace-discs-safely-during-operation-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/replace-discs-safely-during-operation-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/09/replace-discs-safely-during-operation-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/replace-discs-safely-during-operation-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/09/replace-discs-safely-during-operation-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/replace-discs-safely-during-operation-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/09/replace-discs-safely-during-operation-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/replace-discs-safely-during-operation-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/09/replace-discs-safely-during-operation-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/replace-discs-safely-during-operation-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/09/replace-discs-safely-during-operation-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/replace-discs-safely-during-operation-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/09/replace-discs-safely-during-operation-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/replace-discs-safely-during-operation-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/09/replace-discs-safely-during-operation-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/replace-discs-safely-during-operation-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/09/replace-discs-safely-during-operation-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/replace-discs-safely-during-operation-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Psa Versus Hook And Loop Disc Differences</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/21/psa-versus-hook-and-loop-disc-differences-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/21/psa-versus-hook-and-loop-disc-differences-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 15:17:57 +0000</pubDate><category>Hook-and-Loop Discs</category><category>grit-360</category><description>Learn the real differences between PSA and hook &amp;amp; loop sanding discs, with pro tips on grip, heat, dust control, and finish—so you pick the right disc every</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="psa-vs-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs-explained"&gt;PSA vs hook and loop sanding discs explained&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first time I watched a sanding disc leave the pad at full RPM, it was a fresh cup of coffee and a maple tabletop on the line. I’d been stepping through grits—80, 120, 150—chasing that clean, even scratch pattern before dye. Then the shop warmed up, the workpiece warmed up, and my backing pad warmed up. Ten minutes later, the disc glazed, heat built, and off it went—cartwheeling into a cardboard box like a frisbee with a grudge. That day taught me that backing matters as much as grit. If you’ve ever fought adhesive smears from a PSA disc or melted hooks that won’t grip, you already know the stakes. The choice between PSA and hook and loop sanding discs isn’t academic; it’s about finish quality, workflow speed, and how many discs you burn through to get a surface you’re proud of.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/14.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/21/psa-versus-hook-and-loop-disc-differences-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/psa-versus-hook-and-loop-disc-differences-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/21/psa-versus-hook-and-loop-disc-differences-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/psa-versus-hook-and-loop-disc-differences-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/21/psa-versus-hook-and-loop-disc-differences-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/psa-versus-hook-and-loop-disc-differences-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/21/psa-versus-hook-and-loop-disc-differences-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/psa-versus-hook-and-loop-disc-differences-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/21/psa-versus-hook-and-loop-disc-differences-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/psa-versus-hook-and-loop-disc-differences-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/21/psa-versus-hook-and-loop-disc-differences-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/psa-versus-hook-and-loop-disc-differences-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/21/psa-versus-hook-and-loop-disc-differences-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/psa-versus-hook-and-loop-disc-differences-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/21/psa-versus-hook-and-loop-disc-differences-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/psa-versus-hook-and-loop-disc-differences-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/21/psa-versus-hook-and-loop-disc-differences-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/psa-versus-hook-and-loop-disc-differences-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/21/psa-versus-hook-and-loop-disc-differences-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/psa-versus-hook-and-loop-disc-differences-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/21/psa-versus-hook-and-loop-disc-differences-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/psa-versus-hook-and-loop-disc-differences-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/21/psa-versus-hook-and-loop-disc-differences-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/psa-versus-hook-and-loop-disc-differences-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>10</readingTime></item><item><title>Soft Interface Pad For Contour Sanding</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 13:38:32 +0000</pubDate><category>Hook-and-Loop Discs</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-800</category><category>grit-1200</category><description>Engineer-tested guide to soft interface pads for contour sanding and hook and loop sanding discs—materials, heat control, dust, and real-world results.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="hook-and-loop-sanding-discs-and-soft-interface-pads"&gt;Hook and Loop Sanding Discs and Soft Interface Pads&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early Sunday, the shop is quiet except for the soft thrum of a random-orbit sander. You’re easing into the inside radius of a chair arm, the kind of curve where the wood tells on you: one careless second and you’ve burned through stain on the edge. You swap to a softer setup—an interface pad between the pad and your hook and loop sanding discs—and the whole feel changes. The pad yields just enough to keep the abrasive in full contact along the curve, and the sander stops chattering. Your hands relax. The dust stream settles into the vacuum instead of fogging the bench light. The finish doesn’t scream for attention anymore; it whispers that you got the contour right.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/27.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/soft-interface-pad-for-contour-sanding-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Avoid Edge Lift At High Rpm</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/avoid-edge-lift-at-high-rpm-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/avoid-edge-lift-at-high-rpm-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 12 Dec 2025 13:40:36 +0000</pubDate><category>Hook-and-Loop Discs</category><category>grit-150</category><description>Prevent edge lift at high RPM with hook and loop sanding discs—optimize pads, pressure, heat, and workflow for flawless surface preparation.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="stop-edge-lift-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs-at-rpm"&gt;Stop Edge Lift: Hook and Loop Sanding Discs at RPM&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first time I heard the flit of a disc edge slapping a workpiece at full speed, I knew the surface was lost. The panel had been blocked flat, the vacuum switched on, and the sander wound up to max. Ten seconds later, the perimeter of the abrasive began to chatter. The hook field ran hot, the outer 5 mm lifted, and a spiral scar traced the grain like a tattoo I didn’t order. If you’ve ever watched your finish window close in a heartbeat, you know the feeling—time and material slipping away because the disc couldn’t hold together at speed.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/11.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/avoid-edge-lift-at-high-rpm-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/avoid-edge-lift-at-high-rpm-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/avoid-edge-lift-at-high-rpm-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/avoid-edge-lift-at-high-rpm-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/avoid-edge-lift-at-high-rpm-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/avoid-edge-lift-at-high-rpm-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/avoid-edge-lift-at-high-rpm-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/avoid-edge-lift-at-high-rpm-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/avoid-edge-lift-at-high-rpm-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/avoid-edge-lift-at-high-rpm-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/avoid-edge-lift-at-high-rpm-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/avoid-edge-lift-at-high-rpm-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/avoid-edge-lift-at-high-rpm-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/avoid-edge-lift-at-high-rpm-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/avoid-edge-lift-at-high-rpm-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/avoid-edge-lift-at-high-rpm-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/avoid-edge-lift-at-high-rpm-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/avoid-edge-lift-at-high-rpm-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/avoid-edge-lift-at-high-rpm-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/avoid-edge-lift-at-high-rpm-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/avoid-edge-lift-at-high-rpm-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/avoid-edge-lift-at-high-rpm-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/avoid-edge-lift-at-high-rpm-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/avoid-edge-lift-at-high-rpm-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Best Grits For Automotive Sanding Discs</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/26/best-grits-for-automotive-sanding-discs-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/26/best-grits-for-automotive-sanding-discs-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 26 Nov 2025 14:17:48 +0000</pubDate><category>Hook-and-Loop Discs</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-360</category><category>dust control</category><description>Learn the best grits for automotive sanding discs, with precise workflows, abrasive choices, and pro tips for faster, flatter finishes using hook and loop</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="best-grits-for-automotive-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs"&gt;Best Grits for Automotive Hook and Loop Sanding Discs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The garage is quiet except for the soft thrum of a dual-action sander spooling up, and the faint sweetness of primer in the air. Your project is a faded fender you’ve stared at for months—part nostalgia, part challenge. You’ve taped edges, set a new backup pad, and slipped on a fresh pack of hook and loop sanding discs, ready to erase rust blooms and orange peel like they were never there. It’s a simple plan: coarse to fine, feather the old paint, level the filler, bury the scratches. Yet if you’ve ever lost the plot mid-sand—loading discs in minutes, burning through edges, or chasing mysterious swirl marks—you know grit choice and workflow make or break the job.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/26.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/26/best-grits-for-automotive-sanding-discs-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/best-grits-for-automotive-sanding-discs-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/26/best-grits-for-automotive-sanding-discs-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/best-grits-for-automotive-sanding-discs-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/26/best-grits-for-automotive-sanding-discs-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/best-grits-for-automotive-sanding-discs-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/26/best-grits-for-automotive-sanding-discs-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/best-grits-for-automotive-sanding-discs-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/26/best-grits-for-automotive-sanding-discs-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/best-grits-for-automotive-sanding-discs-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/26/best-grits-for-automotive-sanding-discs-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/best-grits-for-automotive-sanding-discs-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/26/best-grits-for-automotive-sanding-discs-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/best-grits-for-automotive-sanding-discs-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/26/best-grits-for-automotive-sanding-discs-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/best-grits-for-automotive-sanding-discs-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/26/best-grits-for-automotive-sanding-discs-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/best-grits-for-automotive-sanding-discs-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/26/best-grits-for-automotive-sanding-discs-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/best-grits-for-automotive-sanding-discs-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/26/best-grits-for-automotive-sanding-discs-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/best-grits-for-automotive-sanding-discs-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/26/best-grits-for-automotive-sanding-discs-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/best-grits-for-automotive-sanding-discs-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Clean Hook And Loop Pads To Extend Life</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/clean-hook-and-loop-pads-to-extend-life-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/clean-hook-and-loop-pads-to-extend-life-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 14 Nov 2025 15:26:13 +0000</pubDate><category>Hook-and-Loop Discs</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Clean hook and loop pads to extend the life of hook and loop sanding discs.

&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning in the shop: coffee on the bench, a fresh board clamped up, and the familiar hum of the random orbit sander. You press a new disc onto the pad, pull the trigger, and start your first pass—only to feel the disk skate and skip. You lift the sander and find a fuzz of dust caked onto the hooks, a few bent over, and that telltale glossy sheen that means friction has had its way with the pad. The job slows, the finish suffers, and those hook and loop sanding discs seem to be losing their grip long before the abrasive is worn out.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/10.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/clean-hook-and-loop-pads-to-extend-life-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/clean-hook-and-loop-pads-to-extend-life-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/clean-hook-and-loop-pads-to-extend-life-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/clean-hook-and-loop-pads-to-extend-life-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/clean-hook-and-loop-pads-to-extend-life-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/clean-hook-and-loop-pads-to-extend-life-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/clean-hook-and-loop-pads-to-extend-life-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/clean-hook-and-loop-pads-to-extend-life-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/clean-hook-and-loop-pads-to-extend-life-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/clean-hook-and-loop-pads-to-extend-life-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/clean-hook-and-loop-pads-to-extend-life-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/clean-hook-and-loop-pads-to-extend-life-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/clean-hook-and-loop-pads-to-extend-life-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/clean-hook-and-loop-pads-to-extend-life-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/clean-hook-and-loop-pads-to-extend-life-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/clean-hook-and-loop-pads-to-extend-life-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/clean-hook-and-loop-pads-to-extend-life-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/clean-hook-and-loop-pads-to-extend-life-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/clean-hook-and-loop-pads-to-extend-life-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/clean-hook-and-loop-pads-to-extend-life-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/clean-hook-and-loop-pads-to-extend-life-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/clean-hook-and-loop-pads-to-extend-life-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/clean-hook-and-loop-pads-to-extend-life-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/clean-hook-and-loop-pads-to-extend-life-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Multi Hole Pattern Discs For Dust Extraction</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/multi-hole-pattern-discs-for-dust-extraction-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/multi-hole-pattern-discs-for-dust-extraction-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 05 Nov 2025 19:36:13 +0000</pubDate><category>Hook-and-Loop Discs</category><category>grit-100</category><category>grit-180</category><category>dust control</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Master dust extraction with multi-hole pattern, hook and loop sanding discs.

&lt;p&gt;When the shop is quiet and the first coffee is still hot, that’s when a sanding session sets the tone for the whole day. I flip on the extractor, click a disc onto the sander, and before I even touch wood, I think about dust. Not because I’m fussy, but because I’ve lived both realities: a haze of airborne grit that coats your lungs and leaves pinholes in your finish, and the sweet relief of clean air and crisp surfaces. The difference often comes down to using the right gear—specifically, multi-hole pattern discs designed for dust extraction, paired with hook and loop sanding discs that swap fast and stay flat.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/multi-hole-pattern-discs-for-dust-extraction-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/multi-hole-pattern-discs-for-dust-extraction-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/multi-hole-pattern-discs-for-dust-extraction-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/multi-hole-pattern-discs-for-dust-extraction-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/multi-hole-pattern-discs-for-dust-extraction-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/multi-hole-pattern-discs-for-dust-extraction-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/multi-hole-pattern-discs-for-dust-extraction-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/multi-hole-pattern-discs-for-dust-extraction-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/multi-hole-pattern-discs-for-dust-extraction-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/multi-hole-pattern-discs-for-dust-extraction-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/multi-hole-pattern-discs-for-dust-extraction-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/multi-hole-pattern-discs-for-dust-extraction-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/multi-hole-pattern-discs-for-dust-extraction-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/multi-hole-pattern-discs-for-dust-extraction-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/multi-hole-pattern-discs-for-dust-extraction-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/multi-hole-pattern-discs-for-dust-extraction-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/multi-hole-pattern-discs-for-dust-extraction-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/multi-hole-pattern-discs-for-dust-extraction-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/multi-hole-pattern-discs-for-dust-extraction-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/multi-hole-pattern-discs-for-dust-extraction-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/multi-hole-pattern-discs-for-dust-extraction-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/multi-hole-pattern-discs-for-dust-extraction-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/05/multi-hole-pattern-discs-for-dust-extraction-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/multi-hole-pattern-discs-for-dust-extraction-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Velcro Disc Attachment For Orbital Sanders</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 04:51:13 +0000</pubDate><category>Hook-and-Loop Discs</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-240</category><category>grit-320</category><category>orbital sander</category><description>Engineer-tested guide to hook and loop sanding discs, from pad heat and disc selection to failure modes, setup tips, and performance tests.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="hook-and-loop-sanding-discs-for-orbital-sanders"&gt;Hook and Loop Sanding Discs for Orbital Sanders&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Saturday morning in the shop starts with optimism—the kind that comes with fresh coffee, a new sheet of maple, and the subtle hum of a random orbital sander spooling up. Ten minutes later, optimism hits the floor with the sanding disc. If you’ve been there, you know the feeling: the Velcro-style backing is glazed, the pad hooks are shiny and rounded over, and every new disc lasts a little shorter than the last. The culprit isn’t just cheap consumables; more often it’s heat, pressure, and a mismatch between tool, pad, and abrasive. This is where hook and loop sanding discs earn both their reputation for convenience and the blame when the system isn’t set up correctly.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/velcro-disc-attachment-for-orbital-sanders-hook-and-loop-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>15</readingTime></item></channel></rss>

&lt;p&gt;On a Saturday morning in my small garage shop, I set out to level a maple tabletop that had cupped slightly over winter. The first passes went smoothly: 80-grit on a 5-inch random orbit sander, dust extractor humming along, the board gradually flattening under a crosshatch pattern. Ten minutes in, I noticed a familiar failure mode—one edge of the disc curling just enough to chatter. By the next pass, the disc was pitching from the pad as if the glue had given up. If you’ve used psa sanding discs for any length of time, you’ve probably seen this: the adhesive softens, then creeps, then the disc lifts. The heat you can’t see is quietly dictating how long your abrasive will actually last.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/19.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/27/heat-resistance-and-lifespan-of-psa-glue-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/heat-resistance-and-lifespan-of-psa-glue-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/27/heat-resistance-and-lifespan-of-psa-glue-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/heat-resistance-and-lifespan-of-psa-glue-psa-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/27/heat-resistance-and-lifespan-of-psa-glue-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/heat-resistance-and-lifespan-of-psa-glue-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/27/heat-resistance-and-lifespan-of-psa-glue-psa-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/heat-resistance-and-lifespan-of-psa-glue-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/27/heat-resistance-and-lifespan-of-psa-glue-psa-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/heat-resistance-and-lifespan-of-psa-glue-psa-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/27/heat-resistance-and-lifespan-of-psa-glue-psa-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/heat-resistance-and-lifespan-of-psa-glue-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/27/heat-resistance-and-lifespan-of-psa-glue-psa-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/heat-resistance-and-lifespan-of-psa-glue-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/27/heat-resistance-and-lifespan-of-psa-glue-psa-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/heat-resistance-and-lifespan-of-psa-glue-psa-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/27/heat-resistance-and-lifespan-of-psa-glue-psa-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/heat-resistance-and-lifespan-of-psa-glue-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/27/heat-resistance-and-lifespan-of-psa-glue-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/heat-resistance-and-lifespan-of-psa-glue-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/27/heat-resistance-and-lifespan-of-psa-glue-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/heat-resistance-and-lifespan-of-psa-glue-psa-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/27/heat-resistance-and-lifespan-of-psa-glue-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/heat-resistance-and-lifespan-of-psa-glue-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Store Psa Discs To Protect Adhesive</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/09/store-psa-discs-to-protect-adhesive-psa-sanding-discs/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/09/store-psa-discs-to-protect-adhesive-psa-sanding-discs/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 16:09:25 +0000</pubDate><category>PSA Discs</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-320</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>Protect PSA disc adhesive with proper storage, climate, and handling.

&lt;p&gt;Late on a Sunday, the shop is quiet except for the hiss of the compressor and the low whirr of a sander walking a maple tabletop toward its final sheen. You’re on the last pass with a clean 320 grit, dust extraction pulling a neat spiral on the pad, edges feathered perfectly. Then it happens: the disc lets go. It doesn’t fling across the room; it just slumps off the pad, the pressure-sensitive adhesive mottled with shop dust, oil, and regret. You press it back on and get thirty seconds before it creeps loose again. It’s a familiar failure—and it rarely starts at the tool. It starts at the drawer where a sleeve of psa sanding discs went unsealed, where humidity found paper backers, where airborne silicones settled invisibly over weeks.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/03.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/09/store-psa-discs-to-protect-adhesive-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/store-psa-discs-to-protect-adhesive-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/09/store-psa-discs-to-protect-adhesive-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/store-psa-discs-to-protect-adhesive-psa-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/09/store-psa-discs-to-protect-adhesive-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/store-psa-discs-to-protect-adhesive-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/09/store-psa-discs-to-protect-adhesive-psa-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/store-psa-discs-to-protect-adhesive-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/09/store-psa-discs-to-protect-adhesive-psa-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/store-psa-discs-to-protect-adhesive-psa-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/09/store-psa-discs-to-protect-adhesive-psa-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/store-psa-discs-to-protect-adhesive-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/09/store-psa-discs-to-protect-adhesive-psa-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/store-psa-discs-to-protect-adhesive-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/09/store-psa-discs-to-protect-adhesive-psa-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/store-psa-discs-to-protect-adhesive-psa-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/09/store-psa-discs-to-protect-adhesive-psa-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/store-psa-discs-to-protect-adhesive-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/09/store-psa-discs-to-protect-adhesive-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/store-psa-discs-to-protect-adhesive-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/09/store-psa-discs-to-protect-adhesive-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/store-psa-discs-to-protect-adhesive-psa-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/02/09/store-psa-discs-to-protect-adhesive-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/store-psa-discs-to-protect-adhesive-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Avoid Tearing Discs During Removal</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/21/avoid-tearing-discs-during-removal-psa-sanding-discs/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/21/avoid-tearing-discs-during-removal-psa-sanding-discs/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 16:10:36 +0000</pubDate><category>PSA Discs</category><category>grit-360</category><description>Learn how to remove PSA sanding discs without tearing.

&lt;p&gt;The workshop is quiet except for the slow tick of a cooling motor. You’ve just eased the last pass across a maple tabletop—grain shimmering, edges crisp—and the surface looks ready for finish. Then comes the moment that always feels a little precarious: peeling off the sanding disc. You pinch the edge, pull, and hear that dreaded sound—a papery snap with a gummy sigh—followed by a ragged crescent of disc left clinging to the pad. The rhythm breaks, your heart sinks, and out comes the putty knife and solvent. It doesn’t have to be this way.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/16.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/21/avoid-tearing-discs-during-removal-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/avoid-tearing-discs-during-removal-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/21/avoid-tearing-discs-during-removal-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/avoid-tearing-discs-during-removal-psa-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/21/avoid-tearing-discs-during-removal-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/avoid-tearing-discs-during-removal-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/21/avoid-tearing-discs-during-removal-psa-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/avoid-tearing-discs-during-removal-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/21/avoid-tearing-discs-during-removal-psa-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/avoid-tearing-discs-during-removal-psa-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/21/avoid-tearing-discs-during-removal-psa-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/avoid-tearing-discs-during-removal-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/21/avoid-tearing-discs-during-removal-psa-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/avoid-tearing-discs-during-removal-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/21/avoid-tearing-discs-during-removal-psa-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/avoid-tearing-discs-during-removal-psa-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/21/avoid-tearing-discs-during-removal-psa-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/avoid-tearing-discs-during-removal-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/21/avoid-tearing-discs-during-removal-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/avoid-tearing-discs-during-removal-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/21/avoid-tearing-discs-during-removal-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/avoid-tearing-discs-during-removal-psa-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/21/avoid-tearing-discs-during-removal-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/avoid-tearing-discs-during-removal-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Prep Backing Pad Before Sticking Psa</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/prep-backing-pad-before-sticking-psa-psa-sanding-discs/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/prep-backing-pad-before-sticking-psa-psa-sanding-discs/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 15:10:33 +0000</pubDate><category>PSA Discs</category><category>grit-180</category><description>Get flawless adhesion with PSA sanding discs.

&lt;p&gt;The first time a sanding disc flew off mid-pass, I thought my sander had quit on me. The garage smelled like pine dust and hot rubber, the project was a cherry shelf I’d promised to finish by the weekend, and the clock was not on my side. I’d peeled a fresh disc, stuck it down in a hurry, and got to work. Two minutes in, the edge started to curl. Then the disc launched and the pad skated across the stock, chewing a groove I’d need to fix. I shut everything down, quietly fuming. That night, I learned something most folks don’t know until they’ve lost a disc or a project: you don’t just slap on pressure-sensitive discs and hope for the best. You prep the backing pad like it’s a finish step.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/29.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/prep-backing-pad-before-sticking-psa-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/prep-backing-pad-before-sticking-psa-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/prep-backing-pad-before-sticking-psa-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/prep-backing-pad-before-sticking-psa-psa-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/prep-backing-pad-before-sticking-psa-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/prep-backing-pad-before-sticking-psa-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/prep-backing-pad-before-sticking-psa-psa-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/prep-backing-pad-before-sticking-psa-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/prep-backing-pad-before-sticking-psa-psa-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/prep-backing-pad-before-sticking-psa-psa-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/prep-backing-pad-before-sticking-psa-psa-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/prep-backing-pad-before-sticking-psa-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/prep-backing-pad-before-sticking-psa-psa-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/prep-backing-pad-before-sticking-psa-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/prep-backing-pad-before-sticking-psa-psa-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/prep-backing-pad-before-sticking-psa-psa-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/prep-backing-pad-before-sticking-psa-psa-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/prep-backing-pad-before-sticking-psa-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/prep-backing-pad-before-sticking-psa-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/prep-backing-pad-before-sticking-psa-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/prep-backing-pad-before-sticking-psa-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/prep-backing-pad-before-sticking-psa-psa-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2026/01/01/prep-backing-pad-before-sticking-psa-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/prep-backing-pad-before-sticking-psa-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Best Grits For Leveling Primer</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 12 Dec 2025 14:45:24 +0000</pubDate><category>PSA Discs</category><category>grit-150</category><category>grit-180</category><category>grit-220</category><category>grit-320</category><category>grit-400</category><category>grit-500</category><category>grit-600</category><category>grit-800</category><category>clear coat</category><category>wet sanding</category><description>Engineer-tested guide to the best grits for leveling primer.

&lt;p&gt;Saturday mornings in my garage start with coffee, a quiet radio, and a panel that still holds a map of yesterday’s imperfections. The primer is flat gray, but under a raking light you can read it like topography—little ridges around a dent repair, faint peel from a heavy pass, and that one shallow wave you only see when you step back. I’ve learned that this is where the paint job is actually won or lost, not in the clear coat. And the tools matter: the block, the sander orbit, the mineral in the abrasive, even the adhesive that bonds the disc. When I swapped to psa sanding discs on a rigid interface for the first “leveling” cut, I noticed two things right away—straighter panels and fewer surprises after sealer.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/13.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/12/12/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/best-grits-for-leveling-primer-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>11</readingTime></item><item><title>Psa Discs For Aggressive Stock Removal</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/27/psa-discs-for-aggressive-stock-removal-psa-sanding-discs/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/27/psa-discs-for-aggressive-stock-removal-psa-sanding-discs/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 27 Nov 2025 13:37:06 +0000</pubDate><category>PSA Discs</category><category>grit-60</category><category>grit-360</category><category>grit progression</category><description>Engineer-tested guide to PSA sanding discs for rapid stock removal: materials, grit strategy, heat control, and setup tips for wood and metal.</description><summary>&lt;h2 id="psa-sanding-discs-for-aggressive-stock-removal"&gt;PSA Sanding Discs for Aggressive Stock Removal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still remember the first time I leveled a twisted maple slab on a big, humming disc sander. The shop was quiet except for the steady hiss of grit meeting wood and the faint thrum of a balanced steel plate spinning up to speed. It was a late night build—coffee cooling on the bench, layout pencil lines still on the slab. I needed flat and fast, not pretty. Hook-and-loop discs had been slipping and smearing, and I was burning edges before I even got close to level. Swapping to psa sanding discs felt mundane in the moment—peel, align, stick—but the result wasn’t. The interface stopped flexing. The contact became honest. Stock disappeared, angles held, and the surface came out flat enough that a straightedge was suddenly interesting again.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/28.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/27/psa-discs-for-aggressive-stock-removal-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/psa-discs-for-aggressive-stock-removal-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/27/psa-discs-for-aggressive-stock-removal-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/psa-discs-for-aggressive-stock-removal-psa-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/27/psa-discs-for-aggressive-stock-removal-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/psa-discs-for-aggressive-stock-removal-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/27/psa-discs-for-aggressive-stock-removal-psa-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/psa-discs-for-aggressive-stock-removal-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/27/psa-discs-for-aggressive-stock-removal-psa-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/psa-discs-for-aggressive-stock-removal-psa-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/27/psa-discs-for-aggressive-stock-removal-psa-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/psa-discs-for-aggressive-stock-removal-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/27/psa-discs-for-aggressive-stock-removal-psa-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/psa-discs-for-aggressive-stock-removal-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/27/psa-discs-for-aggressive-stock-removal-psa-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/psa-discs-for-aggressive-stock-removal-psa-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/27/psa-discs-for-aggressive-stock-removal-psa-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/psa-discs-for-aggressive-stock-removal-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/27/psa-discs-for-aggressive-stock-removal-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/psa-discs-for-aggressive-stock-removal-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/27/psa-discs-for-aggressive-stock-removal-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/psa-discs-for-aggressive-stock-removal-psa-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/27/psa-discs-for-aggressive-stock-removal-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/psa-discs-for-aggressive-stock-removal-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>13</readingTime></item><item><title>Remove Psa Residue From Backing Pads</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/remove-psa-residue-from-backing-pads-psa-sanding-discs/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/remove-psa-residue-from-backing-pads-psa-sanding-discs/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 14 Nov 2025 16:14:05 +0000</pubDate><category>PSA Discs</category><category>grit-240</category><description>Learn safe, effective methods to remove PSA adhesive residue from sander backing pads without damage.

&lt;p&gt;There’s a moment every finisher dreads. The shop is quiet, the first pass on a white oak tabletop is planned, and you’re chasing a flawless, flat reflection. You peel off a used adhesive disc, reach for a fresh one, and—snap—the new disc blisters away from the pad seconds after the machine spins up. You pull the pad and run a thumb across the face. It’s not flat rubber anymore; it’s a patchwork of glazed islands and stringy adhesive, the aftermath of a too-hot removal. If you rely on psa sanding discs for flatness-critical work—whether it’s a disc grinder, DA sander, or a 20-inch platen—you know how fast one gummy pad can unravel an entire day’s finishing plan.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/images/brand/12.webp" medium="image"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/remove-psa-residue-from-backing-pads-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/remove-psa-residue-from-backing-pads-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/remove-psa-residue-from-backing-pads-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/remove-psa-residue-from-backing-pads-psa-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/remove-psa-residue-from-backing-pads-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/remove-psa-residue-from-backing-pads-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/remove-psa-residue-from-backing-pads-psa-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/remove-psa-residue-from-backing-pads-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/remove-psa-residue-from-backing-pads-psa-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/remove-psa-residue-from-backing-pads-psa-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/remove-psa-residue-from-backing-pads-psa-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/remove-psa-residue-from-backing-pads-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/remove-psa-residue-from-backing-pads-psa-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/remove-psa-residue-from-backing-pads-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/remove-psa-residue-from-backing-pads-psa-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/remove-psa-residue-from-backing-pads-psa-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/remove-psa-residue-from-backing-pads-psa-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/remove-psa-residue-from-backing-pads-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/remove-psa-residue-from-backing-pads-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/remove-psa-residue-from-backing-pads-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/remove-psa-residue-from-backing-pads-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/remove-psa-residue-from-backing-pads-psa-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/14/remove-psa-residue-from-backing-pads-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/remove-psa-residue-from-backing-pads-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Psa Versus Hook And Loop Sanding Use Cases</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/psa-versus-hook-and-loop-sanding-use-cases-psa-sanding-discs/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/psa-versus-hook-and-loop-sanding-use-cases-psa-sanding-discs/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 06 Nov 2025 00:31:33 +0000</pubDate><category>PSA Discs</category><category>grit-80</category><category>grit-120</category><category>grit-220</category><category>dry sanding</category><description>Compare PSA vs hook and loop sanding discs to choose the right system.

&lt;p&gt;Saturday light spills across your bench. The coffee’s gone cool, but your focus is warm and steady. You’re halfway through a maple tabletop—the kind of project where each pass of the sander either reveals depth and clarity or buries it under tiny scratches you’ll chase for hours. You pause with a fresh disc in your hand, the choice still nagging: pressure-sensitive adhesive (PSA) or hook and loop. You’ve heard the arguments in every shop and forum. PSA sanding discs promise the firmest connection and dead-flat contact; hook and loop offers quick swaps and forgiving feel across curves and edges. Today, it isn’t about brand loyalty. It’s about getting this surface right the first time.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/psa-versus-hook-and-loop-sanding-use-cases-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/psa-versus-hook-and-loop-sanding-use-cases-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/psa-versus-hook-and-loop-sanding-use-cases-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/psa-versus-hook-and-loop-sanding-use-cases-psa-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/psa-versus-hook-and-loop-sanding-use-cases-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/psa-versus-hook-and-loop-sanding-use-cases-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/psa-versus-hook-and-loop-sanding-use-cases-psa-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/psa-versus-hook-and-loop-sanding-use-cases-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/psa-versus-hook-and-loop-sanding-use-cases-psa-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/psa-versus-hook-and-loop-sanding-use-cases-psa-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/psa-versus-hook-and-loop-sanding-use-cases-psa-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/psa-versus-hook-and-loop-sanding-use-cases-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/psa-versus-hook-and-loop-sanding-use-cases-psa-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/psa-versus-hook-and-loop-sanding-use-cases-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/psa-versus-hook-and-loop-sanding-use-cases-psa-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/psa-versus-hook-and-loop-sanding-use-cases-psa-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/psa-versus-hook-and-loop-sanding-use-cases-psa-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/psa-versus-hook-and-loop-sanding-use-cases-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/psa-versus-hook-and-loop-sanding-use-cases-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/psa-versus-hook-and-loop-sanding-use-cases-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/psa-versus-hook-and-loop-sanding-use-cases-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/psa-versus-hook-and-loop-sanding-use-cases-psa-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/06/psa-versus-hook-and-loop-sanding-use-cases-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/psa-versus-hook-and-loop-sanding-use-cases-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Apply Psa Discs Without Air Bubbles</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/apply-psa-discs-without-air-bubbles-psa-sanding-discs/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/apply-psa-discs-without-air-bubbles-psa-sanding-discs/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 05:01:14 +0000</pubDate><category>PSA Discs</category><category>grit-240</category><description>Learn a pro’s step-by-step method to apply PSA sanding discs without bubbles.

&lt;p&gt;The first time I realized a tiny air bubble could ruin an entire finish, I was staring at a walnut tabletop under raking light. It was early Saturday, the shop still cool from the night, and my coffee hadn’t even hit lukewarm. I’d just switched from a 120-grit PSA disc to 180 to chase out swirl marks. The sander spun up, felt a little wobbly, and within 30 seconds I’d carved a faint, ghostly halo into the surface. Not a crater—just a subtle distortion that caught the light like a fingerprint. I pulled the disc back and saw it: a pea-sized bubble two inches off center. That tiny pocket of air had turned my random orbit into a tiny hammer.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/apply-psa-discs-without-air-bubbles-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/apply-psa-discs-without-air-bubbles-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/apply-psa-discs-without-air-bubbles-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/apply-psa-discs-without-air-bubbles-psa-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/apply-psa-discs-without-air-bubbles-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/apply-psa-discs-without-air-bubbles-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/apply-psa-discs-without-air-bubbles-psa-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/apply-psa-discs-without-air-bubbles-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/apply-psa-discs-without-air-bubbles-psa-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/apply-psa-discs-without-air-bubbles-psa-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/apply-psa-discs-without-air-bubbles-psa-sanding-discs/cards/instagram/apply-psa-discs-without-air-bubbles-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/apply-psa-discs-without-air-bubbles-psa-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/apply-psa-discs-without-air-bubbles-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/apply-psa-discs-without-air-bubbles-psa-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/apply-psa-discs-without-air-bubbles-psa-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/apply-psa-discs-without-air-bubbles-psa-sanding-discs/cards/pinterest/apply-psa-discs-without-air-bubbles-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/apply-psa-discs-without-air-bubbles-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/apply-psa-discs-without-air-bubbles-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" medium="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/apply-psa-discs-without-air-bubbles-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/apply-psa-discs-without-air-bubbles-psa-sanding-discs.jpg"/><enclosure url="https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/apply-psa-discs-without-air-bubbles-psa-sanding-discs/cards/facebook/apply-psa-discs-without-air-bubbles-psa-sanding-discs.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><readingTime>13</readingTime></item></channel></rss>

&lt;p&gt;Saturday light spills across your bench. The coffee’s gone cool, but your focus is warm and steady. You’re halfway through a maple tabletop—the kind of project where each pass of the sander either reveals depth and clarity or buries it under tiny scratches you’ll chase for hours. You pause with a fresh disc in your hand, the choice still nagging: pressure-sensitive adhesive (PSA) or hook and loop. You’ve heard the arguments in every shop and forum. PSA sanding discs promise the firmest connection and dead-flat contact; hook and loop offers quick swaps and forgiving feel across curves and edges. Today, it isn’t about brand loyalty. It’s about getting this surface right the first time.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><readingTime>12</readingTime></item><item><title>Apply Psa Discs Without Air Bubbles</title><link>https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/apply-psa-discs-without-air-bubbles-psa-sanding-discs/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.equalle.com/posts/2025/11/03/apply-psa-discs-without-air-bubbles-psa-sanding-discs/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 05:01:14 +0000</pubDate><category>PSA Discs</category><category>grit-240</category><description>Learn a pro’s step-by-step method to apply PSA sanding discs without bubbles.

&lt;p&gt;The first time I realized a tiny air bubble could ruin an entire finish, I was staring at a walnut tabletop under raking light. It was early Saturday, the shop still cool from the night, and my coffee hadn’t even hit lukewarm. I’d just switched from a 120-grit PSA disc to 180 to chase out swirl marks. The sander spun up, felt a little wobbly, and within 30 seconds I’d carved a faint, ghostly halo into the surface. Not a crater—just a subtle distortion that caught the light like a fingerprint. I pulled the disc back and saw it: a pea-sized bubble two inches off center. That tiny pocket of air had turned my random orbit into a tiny hammer.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><readingTime>13</readingTime></item></channel></rss>
